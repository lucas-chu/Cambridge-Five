Duff seemed worried aboutthe D.G. and wondered whether he would staythe course. If he did not, who was goingto take over. Duff is apparently anxiousto promote from within. Charles Said thateven if he wanted to he would be physicallyunfit to do the job. Duff had apparentlymentioned various names including Lennox andVictor. My name was also mentioned but thefeeling seemed to be that was more suitedto the Intelligence side of things than theadministrative side and that T should besomewhat wasted in the position of D.G.Charles said that he really ought to t ilk tome about the whole position. He waid thathe would do So and seemed anxious to gethold of me at the earliest possible moment.July 2ndOrr came to see me and told me that he hadhad a long talk with Duff more or less onthe lines of the conversation that he hadhad the previous week with me. It was hisview that it was extremely to have the D.G.Ssucession worked out. If by any change theD.G. fell down, a new man might be put infrom outside and a combination of him andthe D.D.G. might be disastrous. He thoughtthat my talents such as they are would bewasted. He thought however that ought tohave a far greater measure of independence toCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1922do what I wanted within my own sphere withoutreference to any one else. What he thoughtwas necessary was to get some suitable personin as D.D.G. who could step into the D.G.Sshoes when he left. He did not as far ascan remember suggest any particular person.VWhen he talked to me today however it wasclear that the individual he had in mind wasLennox, and he had evidently sold this ideato Duff. He asked me what i thought. Esaid that I did not think that the officewould take Lennox's appointment and left itat that. I cannot quite make out whetherthe idea is Orr's or Lennox's. Orr assuredme that Lennox would not dream of puttinghimself forward for such a position unlesshe thought it had my approval.Brook-Wilkinson asked me to go up and seethe Sherlock Holmes film which I had seensome months previously. It has now beendrastically cut and altered. The Chiefsof Staff Committee has now become theSecurity Council, which appears to be largelya civilian body. Very little is seen of itsdeliberations and Sherlock Holmes is alreaa member of the Council when the filmopens. the film is so obviously over-dramatised that even those who have neverheard of Sherlock Holmes could not regardit as anything but fiction. If there hadbeen any question of showing it in 1940should have voted against it but in presentcircumstances I cannot see that it will doany harm.Catalogue ReferenCe:KV/4/1923I took over the M.T.5 report to Duff. Hesuggested that we might give the P.M. a 2 or3 page-report on the GARBO case; which hefelt would arouse his interest.Duff then talked to me about the office,although had to wait some time before necame to the point. He told me that he wasrather worrled about the suecession problem.He had been turning over in his mina variouspossibilities. tHe had thought of Victor andothers. He then said to me: "I suppose youwould not do the job?" I said that. Ibelieved the view taken about me was thatalthough I could carry the Intelligence sideof things, I was not a very good organiser,but that I should like to have a shot at it.He said he did n.t think it had been exactlysuggested that I was not a good organiser,but that it would be difficult for me to givemy attention to the Intelligence side ofthe business if I had all the outside jobsto do as well. He asked me to turn over inmy mind whether there was anybody in theoffice whom I thought suitable or, if Iwanted to do the job myself, was there anyonewho could give me the requisite assistance onthe administration side. He was in rather ahurry to get away and suggested that 1 shouldcome and see him some time next week. I toldhim that I did not think it was. true to saythat the D.G. was failing in health or energyand that in many ways I felt his departuremight have adisturbing effect. It would bedifficult at this stage for anybody elseCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1924coming in to do any of the drastic re-organisations of C and D Divisions ete. until afterthe war. There were many things which vereclearly not right but it would cause a majorupheaval to get them altered after 4 years.He agreed With this. I told him all my diffi-culties with the D.G. but said thaat latterlyI thought he had got more susceptible to argu-ment. At moments he was extremely obstinateand he probably though I was equallyobstinate On the other hand he had very finequalities, backed up his staff and foughttheir battles with outside departments. Duffsaid he thought that there was no hurry inthe matter. Some people had got rather excitedabout it but he could not envisage any thinghappening for 6 months or a year or possiblyuntil the end of the war. I told him that infact the D.G. was not now over-worked. Hadthis suggestion come a year ago it would havebeen different. The work of the whole depart-ment has declined considerably during the last2-3 months. it may of course revive again butthere is no likelihood of its reaching the1940 pitch.July 5rdI-I lunched with Maj-Gen. Whiterord, who isDMI Cossaak. I told him as much as I couldabout the work of the department and our rela-tioas with S.I.S. I said that he might hearof differences between ourselves and SIS butthat what we really felt was that the 3-milelimit in the zone of the armies did not makesense. We clearly had something to contributeCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1925to the I.B. staff on a purely functionalbasis. S.I.S. also had something to contri-bute but did not cover such a wide field asourselves or have the same kind of experience.Personally I thought there was a place forus both. I told him how we were trying toassist the S.I.(b) units and that whereverthere was such a unit we ought to have anindependent .B.Ovvicer to give effect to theinformation received. I thought also thawe should have someone with CCAO. He agreedto all this. He was anxiousi possible toget someone in due course for Cossack. In themeentime he would like Fleetwood Hesketh tomake contact with the officer designated togo with Cossack. He thinks too that weshould probably be called upon to have anofficer both withoour Force lleadquarters andif possible with the Americans. We thendiscussed the training of the I.B.staff.Heimmediately agreed that it was seriouslydeficient. He was very anxious that we shouldget a course going both for I.B. and G.2.Altogether think the meeting was quitehelpful. He is proposing to send a letterto Vale in an effort to get things moving.I told him nottto do this until I had had aword with Harry. I would give him a ringon Monday.July 4thI spent the weekend with Harry. I told himabout my talk with Whiteford. He was veryglad it had taken place. He thought that ameeting early next week when he comes backCatalogue Reference:KV/4719to London would be adgantageous. In theGmeantime he thought it would be quite a goodthing if Whiteford wrote a letter to Vale.Vale might be induced to move rather morequickly if he got the same thing from twodifferent angles.July 5thBurt talked to me about HMS "Achilles".There are now 5 witnesses who state thatthe cutting apparatus was left in the oiltank which was under repair. There wasclearly a leakage of gas which led to theexplosion. The man who owns the cutter andwas not present owing to illness denies thathe left it in the tank. There ought clearlyto be more specific instructions about thisdangerous gas. This case raises the questionof our locus standi vis a vis Admiraltyenquiries. Lewes is always anxious to callus in. On the other hand B.5 are supposed todeal only with cases of sabotage or suspectedsabotage. The Navy could really deal withan investigation of this sort itself, sincethere has never been any suggestion of foulplay. Equally in the case of "Untamed",Edwards has been in Scotland waiting for thesubmarine to be raised and clearly he can donothing until the technical experts havegiven their opinion. It seems to me a wasteof time to send But B.5 on jobs of this sort.I am proposing to talk to Lewes about this.TAR tells me that young Grimaldi has beenkilled in an air accident.

Maxwell has no objection.Negotiations have advanced a little but atthe moment are far from reaching a stagerean exchange can take place.

All Axis nationalswould be arrested, the consulates occupiedand also the local police headquarters andcable company. All documents would be sentback here for examination. At the same timeAston was relying upon the FSO to carry thecivil security side. As this officer willbe engaged on port duties and is not verysuitable, Aston would like an officer fromour department though perhaps not such asenior one as Stopford. In the right set-upi rather feel that Stopford ought to be doingAston's job. Outside a limited number ofinterpreters, nobody seems to speak PortugueseWhat strikes me as being remarkable aboutthe whole situation is that it should be leftto Aston to negotiate privately about sendingan offider with the party. What ought tohappen is that a meeting of the responsibleM. I.authorities in the W.O. should take placeto decide who should go. The whole planof Lifebelt will entirely depend on Lemonadeand I am inclined to think that like Vault,Lifebelt will untimately fade into obscurity.Going down in the train on Saturday ffor theweekend with carry, I met Herbert of theCensorship. He had just returned from theUSA. lie said that Hoover was getting more andmore difficult. He was now against every.-body and was even refusing to pass hismaterial to censorship in case they shouldpass it on to OSS or some other department.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/192Herbert who had evidently been in closecontact with Viv., thought that we shouldpresent a uniform front against Hoover.When I saw Duff today he said that Herberthad been to see him and said much the Samething. I said 1 thought our problem was asimple one. We were two analgaus bodies whowanted to talk to each other directly.This could easily be achieved if Mills wereput into the Bureau as the opposite numberto Thurston, and making him subordinate tStephenson. i The snag was that Stephensonand Security vo-rdination were persona nongrata and such an arrangement would thereforebe bound to fall down. It was impossibleto get rid of Hoover and therwas nobody otherthan the FBI who coulddeal with C.E. inN. America.According to a P/W report a Major General,G.O.C.German Air Defences in tunisia, statesthat when he was in Norway before the 1940invasion period the German troops there hadorders to stage a mock invasion with theidea of drawing off the British fleet tothe east coast. A number of craft were tobe escorted by fleet units and with aircover, but they would not be carrying anysoldiers.July 6thI saw Charles today. he is quite clear thatDuff asked Orr to come and see him, but thatsince Duff had never previously heard of Orrit must have been at the suggestion of Lennox.Conceivably Lennox may have said somethingReferEnCe:KVI4/192At the suggestion of Whiteford, Brig. g.BarkerBenfield, who is the DMI designate for the2lst Army Group in Roundeip came to see me.I went over all the ground of this officeand the contribution that we could make toSecond Front operations. He has suggested toVale that we should supply 2 .Is, 5 G.IIIsand 2 or 3 I.0.s. He is quite emphaticthat I.B. should control any security matterswhich may come under the CCA0. In generalhe takes rather a poor view ofthe CCAO's organ-isation. He thinks that when things settledown the French will hotly resent any sortOf colo isation by ourselves, and CCAO'Sdepartment will be reduced to the size of aliaison mission. It seems that. while thelecturers are good, those attending theCCAO's course are mostly Army rejects andnot particularly intelligent policemen, andothers of somewhat poor quality. I explainedto Benfield what L understand to be thefunctions of the S.I(b) unit; I said thatat the moment its relations with ourselvesor with any officers we gave to the .B.staffwere somewhat obscure. I thought that ourbest contribution would be giving advice ongeneral security measures and on givingeffect to the information obtained by theS.I. (b) units. Benfield seemed pleased withthe information I had given him and was veryanxious to keep in close touch. Asnseon asthe 21st Army Group is formed he is veryanxious to have an officer from this depart-ment as an adviser on Security matters.Itold him about our difficulties with M.1.6which were aggravated by the fact that up toCatalogue the moment Reference:KV14/192 Reference:k we had been given no positive(2commitment. In order to plan ahead and getpeople properly trained, we wanted to knowprecisely what number of officers wer wereexpected to provide and exactly whatthey were expected to do. I told him aboutthe visit here of Aston which was rathertypical of the present situation. Benfieldseems a sensible person and at any raterealises the dilatoriness of the militarymachine.July 7thAt the Wednesday meeting Hart stated thatthe man previously referred to as JacquesJANSEN is Joseph Henri Pierre JANSSENS.This man had the same cover n ame as STEINER,both came from Antwerp and both were EinzMarine agents and came through France,spainand Portugal. The result of this has beenthat the Abwehr have got them thoroughlymuddled up. We have however been able tosort them out. JANSSENS is at 020.We have had a request from Kenneth Strongin North Africa for a counter-sabotageofficer. It is not clear whether someonewith general knowledge of counter-sabotage isrequired or an investigator with technicalknowledge. We have wired back giving thequalifications of John Mair and Skardon andasking precisely what is required and wherethe officer is to operate.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1923I have had a talk with TAR and Dick Butleron the succession problem. Both of themseem to think that I am the only person inthe office to do the job and that I snouldtake it if it is offered to me.There are two rather good stories going roundabout the Americans in Tunisia. When theAmericans were attacked at Gaisa theyapparently ran pretty fast. A Britisn Generalseeing an American General, asked him if hecould do any thing to ste ady his troops. Hereplied, "Well, General, if you could haveseen those fellows on manoeuvres, they werejust dandy, but I gues that right now they'rplumb scared". The other story is animaginary conversation between Lisenhower andMonty. Eisenhower told Monty that he wasgiving him 100,000 troops. Monty thenenquired about the quality of the men andEisenhower replied: "Well, General, I guessthey're like a bunch of bananas". Monty askedexactly what this meant. Eisenhower replied:"Those who are not green are yellow, andthose that are not yellow are rotten". I amnot quoting these stories in any malicioussense but merely because they are ratherfunny. It does Rk seem that the Americansregarded Tunisia largely as a trainingground and it must be expected that youcannot build up a trained army of 7 millionsin 18 months. Everybody has to go throughhell-fire and gain practical experience bytheir mistakes.Catalogue RefereNCe:KVI4/192iuThere have been 687 arrivals in June at theLRC. This included a large number of French-men. Examination could not be So full as usuaIt is clear from the stories of some of thesepeople that our organisations in France andBelgium have been very seriously penetratedby the enemy and that a large number ofarrests have taken place.Evelyn Baring has returned from the Argentineand he told Ned that the Argentine was likelyto be in the war in about. 6 weeks time. Theyapparently want to get certain of their shipshome first.July BthBurt tells me that an inspector at the Yardnamed Richardson had been asked to go toNarth Africa to do counter-sabotage work.Hehad apparently been recruited by A.G.II.I asked him to enquire further and it even-tually transpired that Richardson was wantedto deal with subversive activities in fac-tories and ca' canny. It seems that hewill probably be wanted for Italy. He isbelieve a good CID officer but the fact thathe does not speak Italian will detract con-siderably from his value. I should havethought that this was the kind of job whichcould perhaps have been done more effectivelyby someone like John Mair. I presume thatRichardson will join the CCAOs staff. Heis going out as a Major, whereas Skardon,if he goes to N.Africa on counter-sabotage for]willbe. GSO his is one more instanceCatalogue Reference:KV/47192ISof the general inefficiency of the W.0.I lunched with Roger Hollis, with whomdiscussed the succession problem. He toothinks that I should take it. He is alsoof the opinion that a change at the topwould be a mistake. A change in No.2 wouldbe an advantage in some ways but might giveoffence to the D. G. and only make my posisionrather more difficult. Dick who is notparticularly well is going through a veryacute phase.of general frustration. Hethinks that the office has failed lamentablyin winning any of its battles with otherdepts. and probably this would not have beenSO had it been militarised. He is stronglyof opinion that a neN head of this dept. atthis moment Nould not really do much good.He feels very definitely however thatshould take the job if a crisis arises andthat the succession question should bedefinitely settled. He takes more or lessthe same view about Harker as the rest of us.Duff asked me to go over this afternoon. Hegave. me back the MT5 report which the P.M.had read with interest. He had said a wordto the PM about the STOCKMAN case. The PMwas horrified and thought quite definitelythat something ought to be done. He wishesto be kept informed.I told Duff that I had been thinking a gooddeal about the succession problem.1hadgoneover all the people in this office andalthough L did not wish to appear conceitedI was certain that if did not do the jobCatalogue Reference:KVI4/192lb\there was rb ody else.I could if he wishedgive him a pen-picture of anyone who mightbe considered remotely possible. He askedme what Lennox did. I told him how his jobhad grown up. He sat on the ISSB and keptS.I.S. and ourselves informed about opera-tions. This was useful to C. and also onoccasions to SOE. C. for example would wishto prevent CCO from carrying out a raid on apart of the coast were he was in thehabit of dropping his agents. It was usefulto us to know something about future plans.Lennox also covered secret trials. Thisinvolved sending Boddington to a particulararea either to get the local gossip or tosee what general security measures were beingtaken. T thought that what he did he didquite well, but that it did not amount tovery much. L did not think he qualified fora big job in the office. Duff then askedme about Orr. I said L thought Orr asslightly Beurotic. I recalled the cecasionon which he had got extremely excited atthe Scrubs and walked up and donn my celltelling me that we vere all going to be sackedand that Frost was going to t ke over.He had S id the S me thing to Victor and Wehad both said that he was slightly crackers.L did not think that he was by any means afool. His work was extremely well done, buthe was inclined at times to get an exaggeratedview about things and become nelodramatic.I said that both Dick,TAF and Hollis were allextremely good and that Dick was periectlycapable of running .Division if it wasconsidered that I should move up. I then saidthat if there was to be a change at the topCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1927I should like to be considered a starter.Idid not however think that any change at themoment could be particularly beneficial.It would not be possible to alter a greatdeal and the re-shaping of the office wouldhave to take place in the light of ourcommitments after the war, and anyone takingover the dept. would want to know exactlywhat those commitments were before he beganD pull things about. On the other hand therewere a number of minoradjustments that couldbe made immediately. As regards the post ofDDG and the succession did think that theremight be something to be said for making theposition clear now, instead of waitinguntil a crisis arose and running the risk ofhaving someone imposed on the organisationfrom the outside. If it were consideredthat Harker should go and that i should moveup, there was some doubt as to whether thiswould be of any help to me in getting thingsput through. The D.G., though possiblyaware of Harker's weaknesses, felt that hehad aceepted his position as No.2 with goodgrace and that he had been both willing andhelpful. He would therefore be reluctant toget rid of him, and if forced to do so mightresent my intrusion. L did not think thatany great harm could result from allowingHarker to remain. Inside the office he wasno ehlp to anybody since he seemed incapableof making up his own ming about any ything.Outside the office he did not really affectme but he did to some extent F.Division.Ihad not been out with him for some time, butin the past he had always made me extremelyuncomfortable. His manner seemed all wrongCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19216and he never knew very much about his facts.One thing I thought should be made clear wasthat if the D.G. went Harker should go withhim.I then had a somewhat academic conversationwith Duff about what the status of thisoffice should really be in time of war. Ientirely agreed with Dick's view that if wewere starting again we should be milit-arised and that we or the Service hadsuffered in consequence. It was however inmy view extremely important that if wewere militarised we should play direct tothe Chiefs of Staff. it would be the greatestmistake for us to become entangled in thebureaucracy of M.I. Quite clearly however veought to provide basic training on securitymatters for all the Services. Training ofthe IB staff was grossly inefficient.Except for what is known as purely militarysecurity, namely the security ofdocuments,passes,etc. we had been performing all theIB duties for the Armies in this country.They had not felt the draught in Libyabecause there was practically no civilianFpopulation and because they had SIME attheir backs. Now they were just beginningto realise the position. 1 told him aboutVault and the sketchy way in which the wholething had been prepared. Nobody in the W.O.seemed to be directing these things, andpeople of quite low rank strolled in herein order to pick up a little information atthe llth hour. In the case of Lifebelt wehad been visited by the G. II IB who wasCatafoguesRefererce:kV/4n9z we should lend himiaan officer for the expedition. The wholething of course ought to be cut and dried anwe should received a definite commitmentfrom the W.O. I thought that possibly thingwere moving slightly in that direction.I left Duff with the impression that if therwas a re-shuffle in the office I should liketo be considered a st rter, and that althougL was certain that as long as the D.G. remaied in good health a change was undesirable,there were grounds for considering whetherDDG should not be asked to resign. I gavehim. the pros-and.cons. of this-point. Hewas very pleasant and as I went away he tolcme to come and see him at any time and to leh im have my views -any-aspect of the problem which might occur to me.July %thBronx has received another payment of E85.There is a suggestion by theGermans thatBalloon should evisit_Lisbonifthis_can-bedone without compromising him.t1 message was received from Dragonfly lastnight but owing to German mistakes. they cou-not decode it.

He wondered:whether it would be possible for us to helpthem out by attaching two or three peoplefrom here.. I said that it-was extremelydifficult at the moment since our commitmentsto the W.O. were still very much in the air.I explained to him as definitely as I couldwhat these commitments were: were:likely likely to be andthe difficulties that we had had with SIS;particularly Felix Cogill, who seemed morethan ever determined to keep us-out-of theSecond Front.

Haldane Porter is onextremely good terms with MILICEVIC, who isregarded as one oneof of the few reliable Serbsthis country. He is very concerned aboutthe Jugoslav organisations in Mid East andelsewhere and he wants to clean up the wholeposition. He has almost begged Haldane Porterto go with him.. This seeme a unique oppor-tunity to get full information about Jugolavactivities, with a fiew to future co-perationand operations in the Balkans. Cowgill whohad been previously consulted by C. saw anopportunity of getting hold of Haldane Porterfor his S.I. (b) unit. He has no otherpersonto fill this commitment, and he is clearlyanxious that Maunsell should not steal histhunder. I told U. that we should not sendHaldane Porter unless.he felt that there\some definite advantage. The proposal wasthat he should travel with MILICEVIC andthen-come back: to thiscountry: He wouldof course be seeing Maunsell on the way andalso seeor one of C's representativesin Istanbul if this was thought desirable.I could-no promise him for the S.I.(b)-unitas Maunsell had a Balkan organisation in MidEast which he was trying to start.. He mighthave: a prior claim. It was agreed that shouldMILICEVIC'S party.the D..G. consent Haldane Porter should go withCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19222I.then went on to discuss our Second Frontproblems generally and in particular theS.I I. (b) units. I explained to C: how wunsatisfactory the present position was and how ill-equipped the I.B. staff seemed to be. .Whatare now known as I.B3 duties, namely civilsecurity, have-been performed entirely-byus in this country. The draught was not feltn the desert as there was no civilianpopulation and SIME was always at the-back ofthe Armies. I thought therefore that we hadsomething to contribute, and that such of ourofficers as became independent members ofthe IB staff should work in close .collabora-tion with the S. S.I.(b I. (b) unit for which we werealso supplying personnel.C. then asked me what 1 thought the functionof the SI.(b)should ,I.(b). be. I said that Lregarded it as a unit which supplied, informa-tion-to- the IB staff on which they had-totake action. This information was of 3 kinds-(1) the ISOS, for which the S:I(b).unitacte S:I(b) unit actedas a conduit-pipe. (2) the: Purple Primer,which incidentally I did not think. was.aery well arranged document(I gave yreasons)and (3) any other information which could beobtained from informants in the area.: Someat anyprate of this information had to betranslated into terms of action, and it wasin this capacity, as also in the ST(b) caparcity, that I thought our experience-shoulbe of value. I could not regard- this wholequestion as a territorial matter, but purelyas a functional one. C. appeared to-be to be inentire agreement and remarked that in anyCatalogue ReferenGe:KV2s of the IBstaff;THIS IS A COPYDOCLMENE2uUBLICRECORDSotosubordinate to the Military ommander. C.agreed with me that the planning for IB stafffor a: particular operation should be done inclose ose-collaboration.between.ours collaboration between ourselves, theIB staff and SIS and that something in thenature of. a joint team shoud go out. Hesuggested that I should have an off-the-record talk withand thatif necessary he would call a meetingafterwards between myself, Dick,and Felix.This led me to-a to a discussion about Felix'spersonality. Isaid that as long as ne remained in charge of Section there was boundto be constant friction bet een our twodepts: The fact was that the 5-6 complexhad become kind of obsessiony withhimI referred to the Gwyer incident, which-wasdue entirely to jealousy on Felix's part andtoid-C. off-the record that certain ofFelix's own people had not wished to beassociated with the protestthat had beenmade. In his. present mood Felix saw theTrojan Horse in -everythigg, and-itwas-quiimpossible to have any sort of rationalconversation with him. These views were noc.confined to a few members of our dept. Theywere unanimous as far. as we were concerned.They were shared by a number of people in C'soffice, and even by a number of Felix's ownpeople, and also by almost anyone in theServiceswit whom Felix came into contact.It seemed hardly possible that we could allbe wrong.

I said that Finney wasFelix's best friend and remained SO but forthis reason he could not inake any use ofthe information beyond keeping it in the backof his mind.: rinney ad.been drumming intoFelix as a result of what he had: seen ofthe work of this dept. and particularly-ofB.1A, that he (Felix) was making a fool ofhimself: He had satisfied himself on thispoint from a study of the correspondence.Hehad however been able to make very littleimpression. Felix appeared to have a rigiddislike for most people in this office, anddid not trust either their discretion-ortheibona fides. He had an obsession aboutM MI5trying to muscle in on the Second Front.Ihadasked Finney whether-he-thought any usefu]purpose would be served by my having astraight talk with Felix. He had regretfully"eplied that in his view there was no chanceof making any progress.. This was the-kind-o the kind ofatmosphere in which we were working.C. then talked to me about the StAfricansituation.

Winether heshould join the SI(B) unit or Maunsell'sBalkan Section would be matter for discussion.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/192291Lennox tells me that we and the Americanshave landed between 6-700 tanks, 2,000 gunsand about 120,000 troops. Reinforcementsare landing tonight. We have taken Sy racuseintact. A small port, Porzalo, was Bakensingle-handed with 0I/Ws by a naval Lieute-nant. One of our destroyers had sent a signalthinking tnat the port was occupied by theBritish. Getting no reply he sent nis Lt.in to look round. The motor launch arrived,and the mayor and C.O. appeared on the quaywaving a white flag. There hadapparentlybeen some mistake and the port was still inItalian occupation. The Lt. took 20 tokenprisoners and retired.I saw Burt about the case of R.LHARRIS andhis wife. These people (the ife of Austrianorigin) have been cypher clerks in Shanghai.>he had been approached by the Japs inan attempt to obtain the cyphers. Whethershe actually gave them any information ornot is still to be cleared up. The case-has been badly handled, and there was a delayof some 4 months after the return of HARRISand his wife to this country before any thingwas done at all.Dick and I had a meeting with Felix on the SI((b) unit. We are agreed to give him Day,courtney Young and Harmer for his FrenchSI(b) unit. He wants Day immediately if hecan have him.He lso wants people for hisItalian unit.This is going to be a moredifficult job.L asked Felix exactly howhis SI(b) units operated. It seems fairlyclear that they play to the G. 2 I.B. whenCatalogue Reference:KVI4/19230action is required. This rather confirmsmy belief that if the G. .2I.B. was one of ourofficers he could be of most value in thatposition as ne would understand the kind ofinformation that he was handling. We alsodiscussed Haldane Porter's visit to Mid East.Felix is evidently very keen to get himfor his Jugoslav SI(b) unit. He has no oneelse at present. I told him that this wou]depend on whether the Jugoslavs were propd mgto move all their forces to Mid East,includingtheir various missions in this country. itwas agreed that we vould review the positionat a laterdate.After the meeting I asked Felix about Bonne-fusse and Paillol. I told him about thecorrespondence I had had with Vivi. Heseemed to think we should not have any con-tact with these people. I said th t our soleinterestwas in obtaining information from twopeople who had been working in the Vichy2eme Bureau for a period of 3 years. Anyinformation they might have regarding agentsfrom occupied territory who might visitthis country would be useful. Felix saidhe thought that aspect of the problem wascovered since French LRC cases were referredto Glenalmond and personally to Donnefusse,who spent 3 days of the week in the country.Wherever it was thought that some informationmight be available in N. Africa the case wasreferred to Paillol. He did not think tnere-fore that we vere missing much. There areundoubtedly considerable records in .Africaunder the control of aillol but at the momentCatalogue Reference:KVI4/19231he has no means of getting it copied and sentover here-I spoke to the Da about the SI(b) unit andthe conferences that we were having with Felix.I said that we proposedto release as manypeople S possible.The DG. has told Duff Cooper that he isproposing to bring Charles Butler to London.buff Cooper seemed to think that Harker shouldgo down to the country, and that the D.G.staffup here is perhaps becoming a little top-heavy. He asked what Abbott was doing. Therewas an awkward pause.A telegram has come in from N. Africa sayingthat they want J.ohn Mair. leanwhile TARhas dfered him a job on the deception side ofhis work which will incorporate Grimaldi'swork. I think th hat Mair will have to go toN.Africa. It is important that we should letHill Dillon and Kenneth Strong see that wehave something really good to offer.July 13thHollis told the D.G.S meeting that the womanSHEHAN had been given 3 months under Section2 of the Official Secrets Act and thatSPRINGHALL had been commited for trial underSection 1. This renders hin liable to asentence of 14 years. it puts SPRINGHALL ina very awkward spot. The onus is on himto prove that he did not obtain the informa-tion for a purpose prejudicial. If he saysCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19232that the information was for our allies theRussians, he will nave to call witnesses toprove his point. It seems unlikely thatMaisky or any of his minions will be particu-larly anxious to come forward.The D.G.,Dic and I had lunch with BillStephenson. The future of SecuritynCo-urdina-tion was not discussed. Stephenson did letdrop rather confidentially that Donovanmight perhaps run for the Presidency.This may be the key to quite a lot. It willbe interesting to know Hoover's reactions tothe possibility.Dick, Rupert Speir and 1 had a meeting withHarry Allan. We first discussed Vault andLifebelt. It seems fairly definite thatwhether the expedition is Vault,ifebel orLemonade, the W.0. want us to send arepresentative. Harry thought that he shouldbe attached as an I.O. to the I.B.staff.This would render his position and rank moreflexible. We said that Ne did not thinkit mattered very much for this particularexpedition, but it would be preferable ifour officer cauld hold a definite positioin I.B. staff i.e. GSO II IB. He would thenhave more authority for dealing with matterswith which he is acquainted and he would beless likely to be regarded with suspicionby the regular soldiers, who are ratherfrightened of people who go about in falsebeards. Harry proposes to call at meetingat the W.0. on the subject of Lifebelt orLemonade. He has a minute from Barker Ben-field about the setting up of the I.B.StaffCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19233on which Vale has asked for his comments. Hewill let us see his draft reply. I emphasisedonce more that Ne were desperately anxiousto know what our commetments were for Second.Front operations. Everyone was knocking atthe door, including the 1.0., and if somedecision were not reached soon. our trainedofficers would be drafted to other spheres.Iexplained to Harry that we had alreadyagreed to give Felix Cowgill three officersfor his Roundup .I(b).MacIver wants to let Tim Airy go to 0.C. asNo. 2 to Ede. This is the first I have heardof is suggestion. I said that while I thoughhe would be very suitable, he had been eir-marked for a Second Front job as he seemed tofit very well into a military heirarchy.I am going to speak to Ede and suggest thathe should have Airy on a temprary basis. Wewould not take him away unless we wereabsolutely forced to do so.ISOS discloses the whole order of battle inSicily. It seems that owing to a breakdownin communications the responsibility formaking such reports rested on the stationat Taormina.01d Panda has sent in an irate telegram protes-ting about Adam's mission to USA, the natureof wh ch was notclear to him. He is evidentlysuffering from the heat.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/19234Victor returned from the Mid East. He seemsto have had a profitable trip to ib.,Algeirs,Cairo,Beyrouth, Jerusalem,Bagda and Abadan.Security at Ab badan is not an easy matter.Coolies who all look alike are pouring in andout all day. The staff are very keen to dowhat they can and the kind of methods employedby the enemy in bringing in explosives,e.gin thermos flasks, mess-tins etc. was explaineto them. Such methods may well have beenadapted to tea-pots which are all over therefinery. It is apparently a custom for thePersians to drink tea ever quarter of an hour.Immense quantities of aircraft are beingbrought in daily for supply to Russia. Theyarrive in crates which are stacked all overthe desert. They are then assembled and flotnto Russia by Russian pilots. They appearto be arriving in hundreds but only gettingaway at the rate of about 20 a day. Securityof the railway is a British responsibility,but precautions are difficult owing to thesmall number of troops in the area.Victor had a fairly favourable impressior ofMaunsell although he thinks that he is insome ways rather like a Mid East version o1Bill Stephenson. There is obviously much indetail which is not good bit on the whole theshow seems to work. Kenneth Younger isclearly unsuited to such an organisation.Victor was very impressed with Trevor Wilsonand his minions. A counter-sabotage sectionis to be set up in Cairo. Victor has a highopinion of Jenkins.Catalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/1923sJuly 14thI went with the D.G. to see wick Casey.We discussed a telegram from MaunselI expres-sing anxiety about suggested release ofinternees in Mid East. Casey said that Arch-bishop Spellman was very worried about thetreatment of a number of Italians who wereliving in somewhat try ing conditions. He hadno intention however of recomending the re-lease of anyone unless such action had theapproval of Maunsell whom he regarded as thelast word on security matters. He had soinformed Duff Cooper.As regards the Greek Armies, which hadmutinied, he confesses that both he andGen Wilson and been caught unawares. Unrestin the Greek forces had not been reported toeither of them in a forcible way. Steps werehowever being taken to put this right.Beaumont-Nesbitt was acting as co-ordinatingofficer and he did not think they would becaught napping again.Casey is having tremendous trouble with theErench in Syria. They are entirely unco-operative and are obsessed with the ideathat we want to get our hands on the country.Whenever they are asked to get rid of somepro-Vichy officer holding an influentialposition the French haggle fpr months andthen do nothing. Casey is thoroughly disgusteadd intends to say So in no uncertain terms,when he sees Massigli today. He thinks thatde Gaulle should have had his head thoroughlywashed by the P.M. over the whole business.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/19236It seems that the best qualification for anyFrench official in the eyes of his superiorsis that he should be thoroughly anti-British.Gen. Wilson was anxious to send several PolishDivisions to Syria. Casey has felt bound torequest him not to do SO unless the militarysituation really demands sucn a course.The mal-administration of the country andits consequent economic distress is such thatthe presence of a number of troops therewould only lead to further trouble.There have also been difficulties with PalestiIt was recently discovered that the taganawhich is under the control of Ben Gurion, hadcome into the possession of 600 rifles, anumber of machine guns, trencn mortars andexpbsives. The fact was discovered throughtwo soldiers who got tight in a brothel. shearms had been drawn from depots in Egypt onpresentation of bogus documents, and had beentaken to Palestine in army lorries.At the Wednesday meeting Hart mentioned thecase of an agent who is being trained inBergen and is to come here on a missionin 6-0 weeks time. No details are availabyet of the method which will be used tobring him here. As heis to be furnished witha W/T set it seems probable that he willeither be landed by rubber boat or droppedby parachute.Gibbs came to see me about the case f"UntamedHe tells me that Edwards has gone over to seeADNI. He thinks there is danger in B.5Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19237having direct dealings with ADNI sincethey are apparently rather wide implicationsin the whole case anggestionsttha the moraleof the crews is not good. These aspectsof the case have already been dealt with Burnwho is also in touch with the Admiralty andthere is therefore a danger of our reportson this matter being in conflict, quiteapart from the fact that matters of this Kindare not really the concern of this office.Quite clearly such cases ought to becO-ordinated in B. 1C and communicated to theAdmiralty under their instructions. I saidthat I would have a talk with Victor and thatI thought he or I would have to speak toBurt. the fadt is that Burt does not care aboabout dealing with anyone except victor ormyself.I saw the D.G. with Grogan about the mattersrequest to be allowed to devote some ofhis time to his own private business, oving tolack of work at the Prudential. The D.G.was quite agreeable but thought that Herbertshould be informed.I saw Moylan With Milmo about the case of WITTMoylan did not seem to realise that peopledetained at Dartmoor were correspondingwith the outside world and in fact we were onoccasions pressed by MirS.hee MrS. of the H.0. toallow certain of their letters to go on.It was explained to him that this was thereason for our saying that there might beadministrative difficulties if the whole ofWITT'S correspondence was suppressed and thoseCatalogue Reference:KVI4/192of other internees were allowed to go on.38We also made it quite clear that as far aswe were concerned there was no objection toWITT corresponding with his wife.Weunder-stood however that SOE had objections Which theH.O. appeared to uphold. All we wanted wassomething in writing from the H.O. authorisingus to detain all WITI'S letters.In connection with the sabotage case at Gib.the Governor is anxious to try the offendeby local court martial. Dick has approachedLincoln of the C.O. who says that a localordnance is all that is required. If thetrial is to take place here it will mean thewhole of the security staff coming over aswitnesses.For the Duce's fantastic ideasThere are only to real panaceas -Either give him GibraltarAnd Tunis, and Malta -Or a kick in the Pantellerias.(JCM)I had a long talk with Victor. he is fullof stories about his trip to Mid East.He mentioned that wherever he went he hadcomplaints about the letters received fromColAlexander asking them to keep some manunder observation because he appeared to bedisgruntled. The fact was that living in aplace like Ab adan where the temperature is 120in the shade, where bugs abound, and everythinis filled with sand, people were apt to getpretty well browned off. There was nothingin their letters that you would not hear fromany habitual grouser in the Army and theymeant precisely nothing. Victor is puttingCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19231up a note on this for the D.G. I said that Ithought he ougnt to speak to Hollis first, butthat the note should certainly go forward.There is no doubt that thessort of letterssent out by F.1. did the office a lot of arm.July 15thI had a meeting with the D.G.,Harry,KarkerButler and Dick on the subject of ourcolonial commitments and the Second Front.Malta has suggested that they snould supplyan officer and staff to open a DSO point inSicily. This apparently has the backing ofLord Gort who evidently does not know whathe is talking about. The only basis on whichwe can enter Sicily is in an .B.capacityunder the CCAO when he is established. Thiswould have obvious advantages for Malta whohave close links with Siciy. - They couldalso provide the officer. Harrow's amehas been suggested.As regards Ceylon, whence a request has comefor 2 MI5 officers, The D.G. decided tocommunicate with Halland who is head of thelocal police and to ask him for more details.The D.G. was rather inclined to think thatthe war had receded from Cey Lon and that theappointment was not necessary. I said thatit was an obvious target for the Japs owingto the Fleet base when operations startagainst Burma. the D.G. did not see muchuse in our sending an officer from here whowould not understand how to deal with CingalesHowever he was prepared to leave the mattercataBgue Referenee:KVr4i92alland.toAdmiral Godfrey has asked us to send a seniorport officer to India. Godfrey is now incommand of the Indian Fleet. He suggesteda Marine of a fairly high rank. We haveno one suitable for the job and are proposingto suggest that Brig. Craig should be sent.As regards Australia and NeZealand it wasdecided to make a suggestion to them to senda security officer over here. This mightenable us to establish closer liaison. therewas obviously little point in our sendingofficers to Australia and New Lealand at thismoment. The probbem is not a German one andthe Jap menace is reading.The D.G. XNX then asked me to outline thenegotiations that we had been having withS.I.S. regarding our Second Front commitments.This I did and the D.G. agreed that we shouldsupply both to the S.I.( (b) unit and to theI.B. .staff provided any demands for the S.I(b)unit were put through D.D.M.I.(O) and notnegotiated direct as between ourselves andSection V.Melland came to see me about the PurplePrimer. He has drafted a letter of commentsto Felix some of which are pretty drastic.In its present form he thinks the documentis extremely unsuitable. He is very keen tonave a special committee formed to deal withthe preparation of these documents. I toldhim that Harry Allen now felt that he wasresponsible to the DMI for the set-up of thesecurity staff accompanyin any expeditionaryforce and for that reason he felt he should beCatalogue Reference:KVI4/192acquainted with all the details regarding theoperationand also with the information avail-able. He therefore had a right to see thePurple Primer and to comment on its contents.I would speak to him about this and suggestthat he should put the matter forward to theD.D.M.I I. (0)Julyl6th July l6thWith reference to the Zip message whichreported on 25.6.43 our projected attack onSicily, the P.M. has now been informed by theF.O. that much of the additional informationin the message was inaccurate. The F.M.,undeterred, has returned to the charge andasked the Chiefs of Staff what reciprocaladvantages we get from having attaches, andsuggested that they should be cleaned outof this country. The Chiefs of Staff passedhis minute to the J.I.C. who passed it tothe ISSB who passed it to Lennox who passedit to me. Jolly good show. We have revie redsimilar messages over a period. Out of 9,only 3 contained information which wasaccurate and two of these were based oninformation already made public.

We cannot controlService attaches bey ond a certain point.Therefore the only thing to do isto feed themwith false information. This we are doing asf r as possible through the Asst.

It is forthe Service authorities to say what valuethey get out of their attaches abroad.I gather that C. also will have views on this.The controller, to whom I have spoken, wouldnot mind if all attaches were thrown out butas long as they are allowed to remain he findsthem useful as channels. We shall reply inthe above sense to the J.I.C.The Abwehr man at Taormina has been given araspberry for communicating the dispositionsof the German troops in Sicily. He hasbeen told that it is his business to reporton the disposition of enemy troops and nothis own. He intends to continue however buthas asked Madrid not to pass the reports onin case he gets into further trouble.

Theformer has just returned from Washingon.He could not enlighten me very much about ourfuture in the U.S.A. He said that Denham hadbeen very well received by the Bureau andhad seen the Director. He had howeverintimated that he could not make any recommen-dations until he had seen the Caribbeanarea. Thurston thought that Vivian, whom'hehad seen just before his departyre, wasomewhat depressed about the differences ofopinion between various depts. in the U.Sdealing with Intelligence. In his view Viv.had got a somewhat exaggerated idea about theposition which was not nearly SO bad as itseemed. In every dept. there were peopleready to cO-operate and others who were not.I gather that at certain levels the FBI getall they want from G. 2 in the way of B.J.s.etcI asked Thurston about the relations betweenthe FBI and SIS. He Said that the amount ofinformation being passed was getting less indless At present the FBI have about 5 XX agentbut they are anxious to increase the numbersand for this purpose would like us to let morepeople go through Trinidad, either to northr south America. In some ways the FBI wouldprefer to have these people in S. americawhere they get gre ter facilities than intheir own country. If they have any troublewith the agent down there they can quiteeasily get the authorities to lock him upand no questions are asked. Thurston saidthat the case of ALEXANDER, the Czech inLisbon, had been the cause of further friction.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/192Apparently he was represented to the FBIeither by OSS or Security co-Ordination arboth as a person who would be suitable torun as a XX agent. They were not howeverprovided With any background. It was onlyafter enquiry here that they learned aboutALEXANDER'S doings in Lisbon. Not unnaturallythey turned the case down. it has now I under-stand been agreed that ALEXANDER should begiven a visa for the US. provided we undertook to take him off at Trinidad.The Abwehr in Rome state that the ttalianshave fought very badly in Sicily. It seemsthat the offider in charge of the guns atAugusta blew up his Neapons and told hismen to escape as best they could. It is saidthat a Gen. Roatta has peen sent by the Duceon a special mssion to the tuhrer to askthe latter to bring forces from the EasternFront until the invasion in the west has beenrepulsed. This request will not come at avery opportune moment seeing that the Russianshave just taken the offensive in the vicinityof Orel.

Our memo asking for thesupport of the JIC in procuring ficers ofhigher rank f r 120 was discussed. It wasagreed to give our proposals the ap rovalof the JIC but DNI and ACSI both doubtedwhether they would be able to help in provid-ing officers. They were very hard-pressedhemselves, and in great difficulty in gettingpeople with language qualificationsHarry Allen raised the question of leakage ofinformation about Sicily through the Swedishattache. I put in a memo on this subjectwhich vill be ineluded in the JIO's replyto the Chiefs ofStaff. Harry alsoraised thequestion of the new variation of Lifebelt.ACSI said that he thought assistance from uson the security side would be very welcome.It is understood that two of the islands areto be used as a base for aircraft and thatthe Portuguese will take the necessarysteps to round up the Germans. It wall clearlybe necessary to establish a liaison withche Portuguese police and for this I shouldhave thought that Stopford would be helpful.The Air For ce have no exact equivalent ofFSP. the nearest thing is the Provost Marshalbranch. There is of course also the questionof port sedurity. Harry Alllen is proposing totake this matter up as soon as ne gets theminutes of the JIC meeting. It is I thinkimportant to get in at the earliest possiblemoment, since the first party is likely to.sail in about 10 time.Catalogue Reference:KV14/195Wren came to see me this morning. He is goingback to New York to clear up and then hopes toget a job in Europe. He was non-committalabout the rights and wrongs of the 5-6 set-upin America. He thinks that Viv. and Denhamhave come to some sort of tentative arrange-ment. Contrary to what Thurston told me,Wren said that liaison between SecurityCo-ordination and the FBIwas still going onand a certain amount of useful informationwas passing on both sides.Burne came to see me to apologise for Adam'sminute on the subject of alleged attempt byE.1B to take over D. 4. He said that had heknown he would not have allowed Ad aam to writeit. He had been present himself at theednesday meeting and knew exactly what wasgoing on. As it was a matter in which D. 4were no longer directly concerned he had m deno mention of it to Adam. I told him that ththere was another minute coming along aboutthe case of BLYTH. Adam had thought fit tohold up a paper for 2 months instead of passingit to Cecil. This struckinn as being a caseof useless obstruction.Burne asked whether we could poss ibly let D. 4and ultimately SCOs have an abridged andexpurgated edition of the ERC report. Iexplained to him my difficulties vis a visSection V and said that I would do my bestto get them something. He thought that someinformation would be encouraging to SCOs,especially where they had used their initiativein sending a man to the LRC.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/192SICarlisle of M. I. (L) rang up just before twoo'clock to say that Commandant Rouvier of theGiraudist Mission was with him and hadrecounted a story received from AdmiralMuselier and Mons.Saurat, about a plot toassassinate Giraud, who was due to arrive hereat 4 pm today. Rouvier had no details.He arranged with Muselier to be at 19 St.James Sq. at 2.45. I spoke to Chief I -nspec-tor Gill,S.B. and he undertook to send upIn officer to see Muselier. He told me thatthere were already two S.B. officers on theplane coming from Prestwick and th t D B.were taking special precautions in connectionwith Giraud's visit. I also spoke to BrookBooth who undertook to attend the meetingwith Muselier. The SCO was warned and toldto inform SB officers. He also the Air Commo-dore in charge of the serodrome. The lattersuggested diverting the plane to some otheraerodrome but since there was no informationas to when or where the attempt on Giraud'slife would be made, it seemed that the ensuingdislocation in all the arrangements was notjustifiable.Jim Hale told me about the case of WEITHARDT,a German dual atioanal who joined our forcesand has twice deserted. The man has now confesfessed that on 2 or 3 occasions attempts weremade to recruit him by the Abwehr. He hadcome here just before the war with theintention of opening a hard-ware. store whichwas to be a cover for his activities. Hesays that although he fell in with thesuggestions of the AbNehr, once he arrivedCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19252in this country he did nothing. Certainpoints in his story which have been checkedindicate that he may well have been in touchwith the Abwehr.I took Harry round Gwyer's section and showedhim the relative merits of the Purple Primerand Gwyer's Who's Who. He seemed fairly satis-fied that for the use of IB staff officersin the field the Frimer was not an idealdocument. tt was not compiled on a regionalbasis, and there was not sufficient guidanceas to the relative importance of the variousnames and addresses. My suggestion to him wasthat he should, in his capacity as DDMI(S)call a meeting with a view to setting up somesmall committee which would be responsiblefor the format and contents of the Primer.This concerned SIS,PID, RIS, Melland andourselves. There will have to besome over-riding authority in the War Office to see thatthe committee's recommendations are carriedout. In Gwyer's Who's Who on Belgium thereis quite an important document showing whattheGermans intend to leave behind. or somereason unexplained to anyone, this documentis not included in the S.I.S. Primer whichjust bee brought out. Clearly a matter ofsuch importance should not be left to thewhims of Felix Cowgill. Harry called uponMellasd and had a discussion about the Primer.Melland said that Harry was very impressed withwhat Gwyer had shown him and that he intendedto take the whole question up officially.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/192$3July 2lstAt the Wednesday meeting Hart mentioned thatthe Abwehr in Lisbon have been asked to provide two cover addresses each for agentswho are to be sent out on missions as soonas the addresses are received. These gentscome from IT/LW in Berlin. Two of them areto go to N. .America and one is to come here.Mlo further details are available at present.Inaccurate reports about the dispositior ofour troops and convoys are still being sent toBerlin by the Abwehr in madrid and Lisbon.I saw Harry about the new Vault Operation,and the suggestion that we should get intotouch ith the Force Commander. He rang upInglis,A.C.S.I., and arranged a meeting.I am inclined to think that Stopford shouldgo in a civilian capacity attached to theConsulate. His sole function will be toestablish close relations with the Portuguesepolice.I saw Thurston with B-W about the KOBBE case.Thurston will ascertain from Washington whetherthey would be prepared to send Aladren up toVancouver on some pretext to make contact withKobbe.ISBA shows that the Germans are rather scep-tical about Tricycle, and that they are inclineto think that Balloon's traffic was beingplanted on them. Tricycle took the bull bythe horns and asked then whether they weresuggesting that his information was also aCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19254British plant. Von Karstoff is reservingjudgment, but is flirting with the idea ofusing Tricyele's channel for bringing Jugoslavout of Switzerland as a means of getting anagent here and also a wirelessset thewhole matter is to be thrashed out in Madrid.July 22ndBurt came to see me about the case of CASATBAYO. He thinks that the wife is now getting advice from a solicitor nd may becometroublesome. He wondered whether it would bepossible to get CASABAYO tried by court martiaand sentenced since he felt that this wouldforestall trouble.

There have of coursebeen numerous reports fro time to time thatBadoglio and the King might be prepared tomake peace, but these have been generally dis-counted by SIS who thought that Mussolini andthe Fascists were too strong. It is possiblethat there may have been some approach throughchannels of our own or through American channel;but at the moment I have no evidence onthis point. I am inclined to think that themay be peace with the Italians in a ma'tter ofa week or SO. Mussolini's resignation wouldin any case De an essential step in thatdirection, and it may be that the resolutiont'o carry on the war is only a temporary one tosave ltaly's face.

L told him thatwe were anxious if possible to get any infor-mation th t he might have regarding suspectsin France who might be coming through theLRC. since it seemed desirable that thisinformation should be on our index. Hie thenraised rather tentatively the suggestionthat from time to time we might be glad ofFrench assistance at the LRC. I thanked himvery much and said that there might beoccasions when we should be grateful forsuch assistance. On the other hand wecould not have them in permanent attendanceas this would mean that we should have allthe other allied governments on our backs.It would obviously be impossible to run theLRD on such a basis.Bonnefusse gave me quite an interestingaccount of his experiences after the debacle.The 2eme Bureau had continued in operationand had never been searched by the Germansuntil the occupation of the whole country.He and one or two others had been ableto work in allied interests to a limiteddegree. Since however they were inevit-ably tied up with the police for the pureof executive action, they were in a positronof very great danger and could only actwith extreme caution. There was no doubtthat certain elements in the police hadsubsequently given them away. After theoccupation he and a few of his colleagueshad succeeded in escaping. They had goneunderground and had started up an under-ground organisation, but the Germans hadgot on to it and eventually SIS had gotCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19269him out of France. He had been able howeverto leave behind a certin amount and was incontact with his organisation. He was afraidhowever that a number of his agents had beengiven away to the police, and in fact rec-.eived a telephone message to this effectfrom Vaudreuil while he was lunching withme. Bonnefusse said he hoped to be ableto supply us with quite a lot of informationand he was very grateful to be allowed togo down and see Baxter at the LRC. Thereis no doubt that Bonnefusse is working in verclose touch with Passy and Vaudreuil.I had a meeting with Denniston,TA andMilmo about the suggestion which has come uponce more to send back enemy aliens,principally women, to Germany. Some of thesehave been interned and others are at large.We decided that if the return of thesepeople was accepted in principle, they oughtto go into quarantine as soon as any noti-fication is made to them about their return.Otherwise they would have an opportunityof going round and collecting up to dateinformation. Since the information which theywill take ack ill be of a static kind theperiod of quarantine is really of littleconsequence. We thought too that each caseshould be treated bery carefully on itsmerits. e.g. if a man or woman had beenemployed in some factory o# importance it Wwould be for consideration whether hor sheshould behallowed to return at all.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19270I went over to Norfolk House with Harryto attend a meeting with Whitefoord, Ben-field and Col.Black of the American forces.It was agreed that we should appoint aGSO.1 I.B. for COSSAC. whitefoord thoughtat first that this officer could alsocarry military security and censorship,but we persuaded him that he would havequite enough to do if he tackled only civilsecurity. Benfield said that he wantedto raise the status of his officer to GSOand that he would require under this oi icera GSO. 2 who would be concerned with thecivil afairs side and a GSO.3 who wouldcontrol a pool of Security Service special-ists, interrogators, wireless experts, andcounter-sabotage officers. We next dis-cussed XX agent work in the field. it wasagreed that this would not come i to playuntil we were firmly established on thecontinent. Prior to that moment all decep-tion work would be run from this country:When the moment arrived however it would benecessary that a small section should workto the operations branch of the onceCommander, and that they should operatewithin the framework of the co-ordinatedpolicy of the Controller or his represent.tive. Finally I raised TAR's point aboutapproving authoritiesfor existing traffic.The situation needed some revision owingto the formation of the 2lpt Army Group.Whitefoord did not however think thatCOSSAC need come into the picture. Theywould be dealing with the general scheme ofthings in conjunction with the Controller.The traffic should be approved by 21st ArmyCatalogue Reference:KVI4/19271Group and by GHQ, Home Forces. In the formerMajor Griggs would be the officer concerned,and in Home Forces Benfield thought thatMajor Telfer would be the most suitableperson. As regards traffic affecting theAmerican forces the existing machineryby which approval was obtained through ourW.O. and Admiralty, could continue untilsuch time as the American Army Group wasformed."Window.", namely the scattering of smallpieces of metal during our bombing raids,was used with very great effect at uamburgwhere we dropped 2,300 tons of bombs inthe space of 50 minutes, with the loss ofonly 12 aircraft. The effect of "window" isto cause a reflection from each piece ofmetal. This to a considerable degree dis-locates all the operations of the search-lights, A.A. guns and night fighters. thednager of it is that the enemy can veryeasily adopt these methods, to which thereis at the moment no very positive answer.I gather that the Air Force are SO confidentof their superiority and the inability ofthe Germans to conduct any serious bombingoperations that they decided that the ad-vantage of using "window" was heavily inour favour. Incidentally it was "window"that SPRINGHALL was trying to pass to theRussians. Information about it had alsoreached KOHOUT, who gave a piece of themetal to Jack to transmit to the Germans.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19272July 29thB.J.S show that the change of Governmentin Italy came as a complete surprise both tothe Germans and the Japs. It was known thatfrom the point of view of domestic adminis-tration Italy was in a critical position,but it was thought that Mussolini would beable to find a way out. It seems thatimportant matters relating to the directionof the war were being discussed in theFascist Senate on the 24th and 25th Julybut as differences of opinion arose and nosettlement reached, a decision by the Kingwas considered. it was thought that the Kingwould support Mussolini , but for somereason unknown the latter's resignationfollowed. There was no doubt that he hadlost the whole-hearted support of the Party.There have been considerable anti-Fascistdemonstrations in niome. Mussolini is saidto be under the protection of the army some-where in the suburbs. The Jap Ambassadorin nome saw Mussolini on the 25th. Mussolinithought that Japan, Italy and Germany shouldcontinue the war in close co-operation, butthat hostilities with Soviet Russia shouldbe brought to a close. Mussolini, in themeeti g with Hitler on 18.6.40 had urgedthe latter not to embark on a war with Russiabut to concentrate his forces in the Mediter-ranean. This Hitler had refused to do. esaid that the italian war potential was low.If there was a landing on the mainland ofItaly the whole country would have to beabandoned south of the Appenines. longas the enemy did not advance to within 10 kmslogueReference.kv/4/192r no idea of abandoning73the capital. The morale of the troops was nonot good, particularly those who had beenconscripted in 1935. Italy suffered severelyfrom air raid damage and there was a short-age of food. He could not guarantee thatsocial disturbances would not arise withgrave effects on the maintenance of law andorder. Only with sufficient assistance>from Germany could the situation be dealtwith. He thought that even now the Germanscould extricate themselve from Russia bygoing back to the 1939 line. Hitler nadformerly said that he would overcome Russiain 10 weeks, but Mussolini nad remarked toGoering and Hitler on sever l occasions:"How often do you intend to repeat actionswhich consist in advancing 500 kms and thenretreating 500 kms.?" Mussolini thoughttoo that the Germans were tired of fightingand would welcome peace with Russia. Hitlerwas disposed to help Italy but could notdo so owing to his Russian commitments.People therefore had the impression thatfighting on the Italian front was only inorder to postpone the day when she would shutherself up within her O n frontiers. theseideas were essentially futile. Time was noon Italy's side and the deterioration ofher industrial capacity on account of bombingwas a matter for concern. The syntheticoul works at Leghorn could not be put ontheir feet for some considerable time andif the rubber plant went at' Bologna, it wouldbe an enormous military blow.

It might even be possible toconsider Dick going with it but that wouldentirely depend upon the situation here atCatalogue Reference:KVI4/19216the moment. We thought that urnival-Jonescould fill the GSO2 I.B. job with 21st ArmyGroup, and Scott-Harston the GS03 job. IfDick went to COSSAC he would only be doinga part time job as he would still haveto carry his duties as D.D.B.July 30thThe man who committed the act of sabotagein Gib. which resulted in the burning ofoil stores has been arrested and has con-fessed. This action raises the question ofsummary prosecution by court martial in Gib.which is at present being discussed by theC.O. with the A.G the alternative is tobring the prisoner back here. This wouldnecessitate half the security staff comingwith him and the Governor quite rigntlyobjects to this. We are putting up a noteon the matter to Duff,suggesting that heshould write to the Colonial minister urgingthat a decision should be reached at theearliest possible moment. There is no doubtthat the execution in Gib. would have aconsiderable effect in preventing furtheracts of sabotage.I attended a meeting with the D.G. todayat Kinnaird House on the subject of America.Those present were Desmond Morton, soxley,C. ,Vivian, a representative of SOE, Herbertof Censorship, Welles and Diplock. Thechairman outlined the position up to thetime of Denham's dep rture. He seemed tothink that the D.G.S telegram to Stephensonhad conveyed a somewhat false impression.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/192THIS IS A COPY3 OF THE RUBLIC RECOROS19'rACT 1958 use 2100There was no doubt that the previous meetinghad decided that M.I.5 representation byB.S.C. should cease, but the chairman had nointerpreted this to mean tak a.final deci-sion for the setting up of M.15 represen-tation, which he felt ought to be subjectto the reports.of Denham and Vivian. theD.G. pointed out that his terms of referenceto Denham, copies of which had been givenboth to the chairman and to C. made it clearthat the question of M I.5 representationhad been decided but that the form whichwas to take was still a matter for discussicHebbert wasdthen asked to give: his views.He said uite.emphatically that he--thoughtHoover's one idea was to get every thinginto his own hands and to breakup BritishIntelligence in the USA. If we acquiescedin the dissolution of Security Co-Ordinatiorand the establishment of separate represen-tation we should play right into Hoover'shands. He did not think that Hoover. had agreat deal to give and that his successes SOfar hadbeen almost entirely dependent onBritish information. He thoughtthereforethat we should present a united front.Vivian said much the same, and complainedthatDenhar had not created an atmosphereof unity- in his approach to Hooverin indepen-dently of Security Co-Ordination. U. saidthat the investigation ofand Vivianhad resulted in aunanimous viewthat view thatSecurity vo-Ordination had been run efficiely. The D.G. said that if the view ofSir Edwin derbert and Col.Vivian that HooveCatalbgureareference!Ry4/192le. Catalogue aim and object wasto set up a world intelligence system under8ohis control and to break up British intelli-gence, was thought to be the explanationof Mr. Hoover's present attitude, the: bestthing would be to get Denham back at oncein order that the meeting might hear hisviews. The echairman agreed and said thatin the meantime the: meeting should expressits confidence in Stephenson, without preju-dice to any alterations in the organisatwhich might subsequently-be.thoughdesirable as a result of Denham's report.The D.G: said that jealousy of preservesseemed to be common to all heads of intelli-gence departments in the.:USA the. USA and thatthe same might be said of ONI,G and OSS.I mentioned that Gen.Strong was particularlydifficult in this respectand- particularlyunreasonable, but that in spire of the atti-tude of heads, a great deal of co-operationwent on on the.lower levels. We had only oneobject, namely to have sonsodyintheFBI who would be more or less an equivalentof Thurston over here I recognised thatthe flow of information from east to west youalways be greater than from west toreast, tobut I thought that there was still a cer.tain amount of information which couldusfully be obtained from the FBI which-wewere not getting at present. This couldonly be done by someone in the Bureau whoseorganisation had the confidence of Hoover.We should not have minded in the least havingMills in the Bureau working to Security-Co-Ordination provided his position was notjeopardised by his connection with-thatorganisation. We had also thought thereCatalogeecreerence.kvr4lyeztag in having aco-ordinating authority. the whole troublewas that for one reason or another the FBIdid not wish to play with Stephenson. Ithought that this situation had arisen onaccount of the lack of definition in thespheres of interest of the FBI and OSS.There was a Tom Tiddler's ground in Washing-ton an which both organisations thoughtthey had the right to play. Had BSC, atthe moment American came into the war, madeit wuite clear that they would not poachon the preserves of one for the benefit ofthe other or keep off doubtful ground, theFBIwould nave had no complaint againstStephenson. There was no doubt in my mindthat this was the fundamental cause of thetrouble.Vivian told me afterwards how much he wishedE had gone out instead of Denham. I saidthat would have been very pleased but nadnot been asked. I did emphaise to himvery strongly that our best interests inthe post-war period lay with Hoover. Hisorganisation would have to go on whereasthe future of the others was problematicalVivian nad evidently nad a very strenuoustime. He todd me that he had had a verysevere headache for the last 4 days and wasgoing away to try and get rid of it. Thismay account for the somewhat irresponsibleletter that he wrote to the, D.G.-Jap B.J. from Berlin dated 2717 seemsto indicate that the Germans are still indoubt about what really happened in utaly.Badoglio has apparaatly assured the GermansCatalogue Reference:KVI4/192gathat there is no change of policy as regardscontinuing the war. Dadoglio had receiveda letter from Mussolini thanking him fortaking over at such a critical time andfor having saved him from plans upon hislife. He expressed the hope that Badogliowould continue to co-operate with the Germansto carry on the war with increasing vigour.Mussolini had however expressed confidencein Badoghip and gave him an assurance thahe would/do anything to make his task mordifficult and in case of necessity wouldnot hesitate to afford him assistance. IfBadoglio wished he was prepared to retireto his villa in northern Italy.Mackenson, the German ambassador, say thatthe Fascist Party has collapsed completelywith the resignation of Mussolini and thatthere had been no demonstrations in supportof it. The Italian Vice Minister of warinehad given an assurance to the German N.A.that the Navy will fight to the end. Itwas made clear to the Jap Ambassador thatwhile Germany still desired th t italyshould continue the war at her side,theye were anxious about the positionowing to conditions in -taly which wereworse than could be imagined. Both theGermans and Japs are concerned owing tothe proclamations made by the King and Bad-oglio, containing no word about the Axis orthe Triple Alliance. They regard this assomewhat significant and as implying apossible peace manoeuvre by Italy in thenear future. If Italy collapsed Germaywould be sorry to lose an ally bit on theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/192% 83 3other hand she regarded Italy as somethingof an embarrassment.

He evidently favours unitedcommand but thoroughly realises the weak-nesses of Security o-Ordination He thinksthat our problem would be solved if we hadsomeone in the Bureau using the Washingtonoffice of BSC. He himself corresponds directwith London and only passes to BSC suchinformation as he thinks may concern any ofits other component parts.July 31stThe D.G. is very worried about yesterday'smeeting and the f act that Duff seemed tothink he had gone a little far in hisCatalogue Referehce.RV/4/192 to carry out "smooth andspeedy transfer" of MI5 work in the westernhemisphere. He is particularly incensedwith Vivian and had written him a stuify let-ter, with a personal one to C. suggestingthat if he really authorised Vivian tosay what he did, it woudd be better if C.wrote the letter nimself.I have gone very carefully through the files.The minutes of the last meeting of theSecurity Executive on 9th April are somewhat ambiguously worded. Having said thatSecurity o-Ordination should cease torepresent the Security Service in USA,Canada and .Indies, they then say that theSecurity Serviceshould make their ownarrangements for their representation andto send Dennamn to review their require-ments and to make recommendations. Itseemed therefore that Security Servicerepresentation in the estern hemisphere ofsome sort or other had been decided upon,although the form it should take was stilla matter for consideration. There could beno question of setting up any new organisa-tion until Denham's recommendations hadbeen given full consideration. The D.G.9wire to Stephenson about smooth and speedytransfer was certainly rather unfortunate,but I cannot see that it was really of verymuch importance.Another letter addressed to YAMAMOTO inSwitzerland, presumably by the same personwho sent the past card, has been receivedfrom the Swiss onsulate to which it wasCatalogue feReference:KV/4/192: SCHLECTIG.

He cannot however be sackedas the subject of his conversation is ofcourse an extremely delicate one, which inpresent circumstances could not be disdosedto the D.G. A further ifficulty- is thatby arrangement with the D.G., Duff has theright to see any member of this dept. Thisis both an advantage nd a disadvantage toanyone running this office. Duff's diffieultis that if he does not have right of accessto all and sundry it is almost impossiblefor him to be responsible for the organisa-tion.

The D.G. required thistelegram in connection with ya letter he waswriting to Duff. The telegram stated thatStephenson had asked for an appointmentwiththe Bureau to discuss arrangements for bring-ing Denham to the Bureau in connection ithCatafogue MI5 epresentation, Reference:KV14/192 inthe USA. Cimperman89was asked to ascertain discreetly if Steph-enson was going with the knowledge and consentof the D.G., or Nhether"he was merely ryingto inject himself into the new picture".After consultation with the D.G. on May 25th.Cimperman sent a reply to the effect thatDenham was the direct representative of theSecurity Service and would therefore be makinghis own arrangements for seeing the Burea u.ccording to a houmanian B.J., it was Grandiwho must forwardthe majority resolutionthat the Army should take over the Govt.I saw Stephenson at Claridges. although heimpoied that the highest quarters intendedhim to remain as head representative ofBritish Intelligence in the Western Hemis-phere, he was I think a little nervous abouthis position and about what Denham would saywhen he returned. He repeated all the argu-ments that ad been put forward by his sponsorat the meeting on Friday at which he was notpresent. He was quite convinced that Hooverwas out to break up British Intelligenee inthe Western Hemisphere. He blamed us fornot sending him out an expert when he wasgiven a mandate for the Security Service.explained to him that I had been very keento do so but there had been consistent oppo-sition from SIS. They had in fact disputedout right to communicatedireet eith Stephensonon any matters affecting the FBI. Thequestio of sending Mills to Washington hadbeen raised. Some objection was always raisedto this.

DO it hadgone on, until the impasse was reachedresulting in the meeting of the 9th Aprilwhen it was decided to make a change andestablish our own representation. I person-ally regretted the wnole business and washeartily sick of the disputes that weregoing on. All I was anxious to see wasa representative of the Security Servicewho knew our work thoroughly co-operatingcloser with the FBI in Washington. If hewere nominally under BSC and this was accep-table to Hoover, which is what we had inmind when we made Stepnenson our representa-very tive, anxious all would that be we well. should Stephenson pay no attention wasto what Denham had to say when he came back,and that if it was decided to restore tohim the Security Service mandate I shojld goout and arrange for our representation.He did not think it would be a good thing toput Miles with the Bureau since Mills wouldnow be tarred with the Denham b rush. Isensed very strongly that Stephensonhas taken a dislike to Mills because heknows too much-about BSC. He thinks ther\fore that it would be better to have him outof the way. I pressed him on this point buthe refused to be drawn. He had Brendon Bracken with him and a number of, other high spotsin the American world. the fact is that hehas played his cards extremely cleverly.The trouble is that all his talents on thehigh level are not directed toN ards ourparticular line of business, in which heCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/192really has very little detailed interest.He admitted to me that he in no senseconsidered himself an expert in C.E.

Ihadreplied that as the burst of the rocketould probably be observed by reconnaissanceplanes I did not think any measures toprevent traffic to Eire would be of muchuse. Even if, as they suggested, trafficwere reduced to official persons only, therevaere still the crews fdboats and aircraft.Moreover the officials would probably bemore likely to leak than the ordinary passen-gers. Quite apart from all this there wasthe coastal traffic. the whole idea seemsto me quite fantastic.I took Dick's meeting.

MasSOE so to speak integrated with 0.S.S. ontheir particular line of business. Sentersaid that if the agents were operatin fromthis country to the continent they would knowabout them but if they were merely broughthere in transit for the purpose of trainingthem they might not hear about it. Archieand Senter advised therefore that we shouldget into touch with 0.S.S. ourselves inorder to clarify the position.I saw Newsam and explained to him Plan BunEbury. He thought it possible that Watts,head of the explosives dept. might be broughin. T said thit if and when he was, we mightconsider whether it would be better to informhim of the true position in case he discoveredthat the whole business was a hoax and gavethe show away.

Stamp and Duster had various counter-arguments but are going to review the case.I attended a meeting today,a the var Office,Harry Allen in the chair, to discuss secur-ity measures for Alacrity. M.I.1,W/0 Tuke,Sir Edwin Herbert and Felix were alsopresent. Air Vice Marshal Brommett is theorce Commander. Occupation is to be byconsent, but only one island, namely Ter-ceira, is to be occupied, with the exceptionof a small naval contingent at Horta in theisland of Fayal. Commodore Holt will bein charge of the naval unit and is to lookafter the cables. Sir Edwin Herbert saidhe thought it would be necessary to havecensorship in Horta and Enta to see thatwireless traffic was Looked at. The cabletraffic via Cape Verdes to ib. was underour control. There would also have to becensorship on the internal cables and lettersthe Portuguese Censorship in the Azores,Madeira and Cape Verde Islands was not veryeffective but the Portuguese were readyto accept advice and representatives wereproceeding to Lisbon. The British Censor-ship were putting personnel t Portuguesestations. Port control of transit shippingwill have to be done if it is done at allunder Portuguese cover. Service censorshipwill be done in units and again in London.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/192(obTroops will be instructed that they cannotuse the local post and the Portugueseauthorities will be asked to bring any casesto notice. It is proposed that all enemynationals shall be removed and also enemyconsulates. The F.O. representative,MrWalsh, is going out with the party forliaison purposes..

Three inter-preters will go with the party, but theAir Force have asked for permission to recruita few interpreters locally. We have beenasked to send a security adviser and alsoa port officer who may go out fairly soonin order to get some idea of the traffic.Personally I do not see that he can do verymuch, if he is to work through the PortugueseThere was apparently some idea that newsof our arrival would not leak back to theGermans for some considerable time. Peron-ally I should be surprised if they do notknow something about it already and in anycase they are bound to find out at a veryearly date, through seamen en route forLisbon.August 7thI have seen Burt this morning.

Ratcliffe apparently assuredDunbar that there was nothing improper inthis approach and he succeeded in gettingfrom Dunbar a statement more or less indi-cating what he was going to say. Ratcliifetried to cross-examine him on this statement,-but Dunbar stood his ground. No harm hasI think been done but Ratcliffe's conductis to be reported to the Law Society.//Burtis going down to investigate Plan Dunbury whitook place last night. I have not yetheard any details. Burt thinks tnat he may bable to help a bit on the press side sincebot the M.O.I. and Newsam think that theycould not give the story to the press vith-out arousing considerable suspicion. TheC C. is giving it to the local press andI have suggested that he should explain whendoing so that he has approv 1 from Censor-ship, as it is thought th it the public needto be made aware that something is going onin.their midst. It is hoped that thiswill stimulate security.The agent "Gerard P" has been identified,and is on his way to the U.K. He is aFrenchman named Ploix de Rotrou.Ostro has been asked to report about con-centrations on the south-east coast.

Personally I think thechances of anything going wrong are about a:million to one. They had previously agreedto My ERIKSSEN going back to Stockholm inexchange for an SIS agent, which in factinvolves them in far greater risk. oweverthey evidently feel that they have got to doeverything possible to stop Victoire'sinformation getting out on account of one oftheir people who is at present in Paris andalso the brothers of LUCAS who are alsobelieved to be at large on the continent.Unfortunately Victoire has been in touch withan IRA woman who is shortly to be releasedand also with Mrs. HIRSCH who wants to goto the Argentine. We are going to try andget the H.0. to re-open Ay slbury since inany case the Governor at Holoway finds thesegregation of his new guests a greatembarrassment. The initial trouble was thatthe H.0. were asked to close do n nysiburyin spite of the fact that Harmer had put aminute on the file explaining that SOE wouldhave to be consulted.There has been a most interesting Jap B.J.indicating a meeting between the Jap Ambassa-dor in Berlin and Hitler somewhere aboutthe 30th July. The Ambassadorexplainedthe difficulty of consolidating their newgains because of shipping. He intimatedsomewhat optimistically that things wereimproving. It was dapan'sdpolicy to inflictblows upon the enemy wherever possible andCatalogue Reference:KV/4/192lioto cause losses to their war potential. ASregards the USSR it would be unwise at thisjuncture to extend the war area and disperseJapan's military forces. Difficulties wouldmoreover be intensified with the shippingproblem. The Ambassador thanked Hitler forsending BOSE to the Far East. He h d beenvery busy with the organisation of the IndianVolunteer Force in the Singapore area, withplots against India, etc.Hitler then spoke of the political ch angein Italy. He found it hard to bear that Musso-lini his great friend should have receivedthe callous treatment of arrest. He saidhowever that the incident was not entirelyunforeseen and he was considering ways and meaof meeting the situation. Hitler attributedMussolini's do nf ll to the bad conditionof the Army. He drew a contrast bet eenItaly and Germany. In Italy the Army wasthe King's and the administratio was Fascist,each separate entities, whereas in Germanyhe had brought about unification of thecountry and the Party, and the identificationof the Army with the State, building whathe described as "one harmonious whole". Hetook a poor view of Badoglio. When Italycame into the war he proposed that the Italianforces should enter France through the gapcreated by the Germans while simultaneouslyattacking the French with 4 divisions onthe Franco-Italian border. This was rejectedowing to the confusion that it might havecaused. All 17 divisions had therefore beencentred on the Franco-Italian borderCatalogue ReferEnCe:KVI4/192but had suffered severe losses. He had askedBadoglio to occupy the islands of Crete andCyprus, but Badoglic had opposed this andinstead had staged the disastrous attack onGreece. Hitler had no longer any confidence:in the Italian Army and he realised thepossibility of the dispppearance oftheir war-consciousness and even of aseparate peace. If the allies landed on theItalian mainland, he would not commit thefolly of fighting for southern Italy. Heyould take the Appenine Range, the River Poand then the Alps as his defence lines.He intended to increase the number of troopsin the Balkans, south of France and Italyproper.On the Russian front it was Hitler's policynotto embark on a large offensive butmtoemakethe Russians wear themselves out. He thoughtthey would start an offensive in May or Junebut they did not do so. Since Germany dis-liked the Soviet's winter offensives he thoughit might be advantageous.t forestall thisby a local attack beginning in July. Thiscaused the Russians to embark on a frontaloffensive which enabled the Germans tocarry out their defensive operati ons whichnad been previously planned. this seems tobe a somewhat tortuous piece of argument.He thought the Russian infrantry was not asgood as it was, but that Russian tanks shouldnot be despised and their numbers were great.It was not an easy fight for Germany. Sheintended to make a gradual withdrawal from theOrel salient, inflecting heavy losses as shedid so. By so doing Hitler would be able toCatalogue Reference:KVI4/192withdraw 15 divisions who could be moved ifnecessary to other spheres. He hoped theJaps would not misinterpret this as a defeatfor Germany. He intended to strengthe theEuropean fortress and doggedly drive backAnglo-American landing operations.The Jap said it was clear from what Hitlerhad said that the Soviet forces would notbe rendered impotent by force of arms in t'the course of the present year. What werethe prospects of defeating them in the fu re?Hitler said that Germany was consideringthe execution of a great offensive but thatthe moment would have to depend on the actionof the U.S. and Gt.Britain. The Jap thensuggested that considera tion should be givento coming to terms with the USSR andconcentrating exclusively on the US. and Gt.Britain. Hitler said that he was not enter-taining any thought of making peace withthe Russians. If he did so the Russianswould undoubtedly join hands with the U.S.A.and intensify pressure against Japan, asituation which would be extremely difficultfor the latter. This also seems to be arather specious argument.Keitel,Jodel and the Jap M.A. then joinedthe conference. Hitler tried to impress uponthem that the USSR was one of Japan's greatestenemies. At the same time the moment forJapan to attack Russia was for Japan to decideand he quite understood difficulties abouttransport. Germany had no intention todictate Japanese strategy. It was moreoverCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/192(13important to bear in mind that anti-tank gunswere of vital importance in a war with theDoviet. He did not know how well the J apswere equipped from this point of view. itwould however be a considerable disadvantageto the Axis if anything went wrong with anattack, once it was launched.Ribbentrop then chipped in, say ing thatalthough Germany did not wish to make anydemands as to the direction of an attack,hey did wish for an attack to be made asvigorously as possible, whereupon Hitlerturned immediatey to Ribbentrop and said thatsuch a repuest was unreasonable. It wasimpossible to undertake a major attack withouttime to prepare for it. It should be forJapan to choose the most favourable opportunityThe Jap Ambassador got the impression thatwhile Hitler still entertained friendlyfeelings for Mussolini, he was incensed atthe way the Italian Army had acted. He thinksHitler will make a show for a time of respect-ing Badoglio's statement that the war contin-ues, but that at the same time he will becompleting preparations to save Mussoliniand to create a new Italy with with him atits head. In the event of the Italians con-cluding a separate peace ne will probably tryand hole one of the lines previously referredto.An S.I.S. report dated 5th August say s that theHungarian Minister who has just returned fromBuda Pest, has seen the vap Minister in Lisbon.The Hungarian Minister and the Jap naveadvised the Italian Minister that Italy shouidCatalogue Reference:KV/4/192not precipitate peace with the allies as veryimportant negotiations were taking placebeteen Germany and hussia with the Japs asintermediaries, which should have far reachingrepercussions. This report is circulatedunder reserve as although their have beenrumours in circulation about German-ussianapproaches, the Italian minister was notnecessarily being told the truth.A Jap B.J. of the 3rd August indicates that.Hitler has been misinformed about Badoglidand urges that Germany should give him fullco-operation. ne says that Hitler does notappear to realise that Mussolini's downfallwas due to designs within his own party andthat the suggestion that the Army shouldtake over came from inside the Fascist Partyrather than from any intrigues by the Army.Mutt has acknowledged the receipt of the sabotage material but has told the Germans that theradio set was smashed and asked them to senda new one.Brutus has been returned to his homepending court-martialThe Germans are still left in some doubtabout Tricycle, but he has given them a cate-gorical assurance that he is not working forthe British.

Casualtieswere 400 killed, 600 missing and 5,000 injuredIt is said that some 300,00( people are home-less. On the 27th July the central railwaystation and a number of factories were des-troyed. The genera opinion seems to bethat Hamburg is out for the duration of thewar.The P.M. has got away successfully but thewhole of Fleet St. is buzzing owing to astatement in the New York press that the Presi-dent is having another meeting with ChurchillThey have been round to Downing St. and findinall the blinds down naturally concluded thatthere was something in it. I understandthat certain members of the P.M.S staff leftimportant papers in the train on the way toLlasgow.August9thI had another talk with Stopford aboutAlacrity. It seems clear that if he is toperform any useful fuction he must be incharge of the establishment Of proper rela-tions with the Portuguese authorities. Thisis really the key to the whole position. forthis purpose Mathews should really be underhis orders, and he should proceed straight toPonta;wher satisfactory liaison has beenestablished he should return, but his success-or should if possible have some previoustraining here before the expedition starts.Catalogue ReferEnCe:KV/4/192116A British ship called the "Fernplant." arrivedat Haifa on 6th August with a bomb attached.The bomb hag been removed without damage.It was presumably attached at istanbul.

The HDSE file shows quiteclearly that Vivian had a conversation withBerle of the State Dept. on July 19th at whichVivian pointed out the potential difficultiesand confusion which may be caused by thesetting up in the USA of an independent MI5liaison as opposed to the MI6 liaison. Mr.Berle replied that that must be a purelyBritish concern and that he found it difficulto give an opinion.

If this wasto be done by Paul Mathews there was notany point in Stopford going. Arnold-Fosterentirely agreed. One discussed the relativemerits of Mathews and Stopford but rosterdid not think it quite came within his pro-vince to decide questions of that kind.I said that I did not wish to run downMathews who was hardworking and enthusiastin.but at the same time had the commitmentbeen ours I should certainly send out Stop-ford since he knew Portuguese and the Portu-guese police and was a man of far greaterexperience.

Atthe same time L thought that he should knowsomething of fhe facts about the office ofBSC in new York. I said that what had reallystuck in my throat was the unstinted praiseby C.

Boththe D.u. and Harry are emphaticaily of theopinion that Dixon should take the appoint-ment. They feel as L do that it would bequite impossible to write off Dick for therest of the war, and that failing this it wouldbe wrong to put him temporarily into theSO1. .appointment as a half-time job. I amafraid Dick will be very disappointed but itcan't be helped. There is a possibility thathe might go out at a later date for a shortperiod after the opertion had been launched.I lunched with Bonnefous, who is very co-opera-tive. He told me how impressed he hd beenwith the LRC. He was full of the importanceof C.E. working in close contact ith S.R,and S.R. using C.E. as an umbrella. He saidit was extremely difficult to impress this onS.R. officials particularly those who had akind of blind confidence in their agents.1 asked him what part he anticipated that heand his organisation would play in Secondront operations. He said that Paillol who,an amalgamation takes place will be at thehead of C.E. matters, was preparing two police-men and a C.E. man for each region of Franee.These people would m ke contact with certainofficer observers whose present present dutyit was to take stock of all of'ficials in theirarea. When the time came they would be ableto say precisely what officials could betrusted and which should be thrown out of officor interned. The above only illustrates howCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1923onecessary it is for these activities to beintegrated with those of the I.B.staff andC..C.A.0. It is quite clear to me that theFrench are not going to accept a kind ofcolonial government in France and that if wetry and impose it upon them we shall get nocollaboration.Bonnefous also told me that Paillol wasrunning agents into Spain from NorthAfrica. I said that if he got any informa-tion about sabotage organisations operatingfrom Algeciras and La Linea on Gib. weshouldbe very interested to have it. He sid hewould notify Paillol whom he thought mightbe of considerable assistance. He suggestedthat when writing to S.i.S. we should suggestconsultation with him.in any matter where wethought records in N Africa might be of inter-esft. This would ensure that the papers werepassed to him and that the neeessary enquirieswere made.The D.G. wants to send Aiken-Sneath's reportto the H.O. It would think need a consider-able amount of editing before this is done.IThe E.0. won't take Aiken-Sneath owing tohis wife being a German. I am going to suggesttherefore that possibly he might assistGwyer who is rather over-orked in his researchseetion.T-R has written an extremely interesting memoon AbwEhR incompetence. He points out thatin strategic matters the Abwenr record is oneof failure. It failed to forecast the attackCatalogue ReferENCe:KVI4/19230on Madegascar, it failed over N. Africa and italso failed over the Casablanca Conference.Since then it has sought eagerly for intelli-gence about allied plans for a Second Front.It cannot distinguish between the good andthe bad, the genuine and the tendeneious.It was equally confused about the attack onSicily. While Sicily was thought to be thetarget, so were many other places. Two agents,one in Melilla and the other in Lisbon, senta warning about Sicily bit they did notreach the Abnehr until after the landings.The result of this has been that reportingroutes have been checked up with the objectof shortening thm. Tactic 1 reporting onthe other hand has been bettered, the mostimportant service being the reporting ovib.shipping movements. In Tunisia valuabletactical intelligence was provided during thesuccessful Germin attack on Gafsa, but sincethe destruction of the German army there hasbeen a most notable blank in the Abwehr'sintelligence organisation. On the Russianfront, Max must be regarded as a success andto some extent Moritz, Ibis and Pasha. Maxreports have been singularly accurate inorecasting Russian operations and thecheory that it is a Russian XX rather goes bythe board. It follows from all this thatduring the last 9 months incompetence by theAbwehr is only partially mitigated by thetactical successes. A realisation of thishas led to the direct supply of immediateoperationa] ntelligenee to ommanders in thefield. From being a somewhat shapelessorganisation controlled from and routingCatalogue Reference:KVI4/192through Berlin. the Abwehr is becoming a number187of decentralised groups each controlled moreand more by the local service commanders.It is clear that the Ab'ehr, confessedlyunable to evaluate and criticised for htsofficial procedure, has either agreed or beenforced to resign a large part of itsresponsibility to the Commands. Considerablechanges have been made in the higher ranksof the Abwehr. Pieckenbrock at Abt.I, Gen.Major Oster, head of Administration,Capt. Mensel, Abt.I Marine, Major Brede, ht aof I.Luft, and Bloch, head of Wirtschaft,have all been removed, with various othersubordinates. It would be rash to assume too nmuch from these ch inges but the cumulativeeffect is sufficient to suggest that theAbNehr's ans ver to the charge against thequality of its results has been a purge ofits personnel.August13thVictor came to see me about Medlam. He seemedto think that we should make a change now thatAdmiral BurrONS was going to take over fromAdmiral Collins, since Medlam's relationswith the Navy were extremely bad. I saidI thought if we contemplated any thing of thekind we should be quite clear what we weregoing to do with Medlam and who was. to replacehim. Victor thought that Kirby-Green couldtake over the job and might be reinforeed bySkardon. I pointed out the possible dangerof the C. in C., hovould undoubtedly beextremely annoyed, taking Medlam on to hispersonal staff.

He has a very poor view of BSC.He told me that while at the FBI with ThurstonCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/19236he had been asked by Durton of the LiaisonSection whether he knew about young Ramsbothamcase. He said quite honestly that ne did notand asked wh it was about. He was then toldthat Ramsbotham had got hold of some American.friend here and had asked him to let himhave a report on certain economic matters inBuffalo to which town he was shortly returning.Thurston broke in and said that Ransbotham wisofficer a very young and that and somewhat ne was quite irresponsible sure thatneither I nor anybody else in authority had hadthe slightest idea of this case. This wasaccepted and the matter was dropped. there isno reas n to think that it has had any effecton our relations with the FBI. I spoke toBrook Booth about this. He told me he hadnever heard of the incident.I gave a lecture to RSLOS at Oxford thisafternoon. I vent over tne old round and toldthem about one or to ne'N cases involving anew technique. I then gave them an appre-ciation of the work of the Abwahr followingthis up with my own views as to what could beexpected of a secret service in time ofwar. It was possible to get high-gradeinformation in enemy territory in peace tilbut one was bound to expect that such informa-tion would cease on the declaration of war orat any rate a few months later. It nould beimpossible to work in enemy torritory unlessone had some extraordinary stroke fluck. Itmight be possible however to get second-gradeinformation from enemy territory either throughneutral channels or through spies dropped byCatalogue Reference:KVI4/192parachute.

I ended by giving the RSLOSa brief idea of what we vere doing at DSOpoints and on the Second Front.Victor had been talking to the RSLOS beforelunch and had outlined to them Plan unbury.He had written a circular letter which heh d sent off to all his utility undertakingsin which he had drawn attention to the inci-dent at the electricity power station at Burybt.Edmonds. He had said quite definitelythat e regarded this as an act of enemysabotage, and had made some reference tospies be eing at large. RSLOS felt that theelectricity undertakings would undoubtedly takethis letter to the C.C. and ask him for hisiews. The C.C would then go to the RSLO andask why it had been tought desirable to communi-cate the informtion to utility undertakingswhich had not been given to the C.C.S. Theywould wont to know whether ity as true. Wasthe RSLO to lie or take the C.into hisconfidence.

Should theygo to Brixton prison or be served with anorder to reportto the Police? This oncemore raises the question of the unsatisf ctoryarrangements for dealing with British subjects.The same of course applies to friendly aliens.Clearly one does not vish to put loyal Britishsubjects into Brixton prison. There shouldbe some honourable place of detention pendingtheir examination. I eventually decided thatprovided the preliminary interrog tion bythe SCO did not arouse suspicion ind provifthe property did not contin nything whichwould stamp the individu 1 as suspect, theyshould be served with an order to report tothe police and should be examined throughetheBID/UK organisation.Cecil came to see me about the EASTWOOD case.Apparently SIS at Lisbon were employ ing aPortuguese intermediary who for reasons ofindiscretion in some other matter had beenCatalogue ReferEnCe:KV/4/1921391dismissed.

He showsthat out of 135 known spy addresses, one-thirddave been used for more than one agent. In onecase the samaddressex hase been used for 9 agentsand in another for 6. It does not followthat if an address is used for a communicationfrom here it is not also used for a communi-cation from any other country. Neither is itsafe to assume thathan address has beenobviously blown it will not be used again orthat an address W ich has produced nothingfor 6 months may not suddenly come intonopera-tion. The Lisbon Stelle is asked to providethese addresses but does not seem to beparticularly interested in chedking up ontheir reliability or informing other stationswhen they are compromised.

He had to give Webster's opinionof Muggeridge, which C. accepted with goodgrace. He then rather opened his heart aboutWebster. Dick told him that it was not theslightest use attacking Webster, particularlysince it was perfectly clear that Oliver hadbased his reports on hearsay. C. then wenton to say that Harlech had expressed similarviews to Vivian.

He has I thinkfinally succeeded in knocking the heads ofthe military and the police together. Thegreat difficulty is the shortage of manpowerand the inadequacy of equipment.

The officialsare all doing their best, but there is clearlyan atmosphere OS. OS."Is "Is this or that reallyworth while if we are going to give the IndiansHome Kule". The distribution of food is notgood and the situation is aggravated by thefact that Indians would sooner lie down andie of starvation than eat anything that theyare not accustomed to.- Many of them in fachave died, and we of course get the blame.T'he>ino-J.apanese war is regarded as somethingof a farce.

The parties of Japanese spieswith wireless operators have all been roundedup with the exception of one.

This however wasonly his private and unofficial view.The above makes it fairly clear Ithink thatthe talians want to keep their country asclear as possible ofGerman troops andthen make peace as soon as weland. Whetherthe Germans will allow them to do this isanother matter.August 20thI had a talk with Dick and Kellar about sourceArthur. This source has been reportingfrequently on matters in Syria. It started inNovember. Each item was sent out piecemealto Mid East but they were never told that the9 messages which came into our possession beteCatalogue Reference:KV/4/192ISIween November 1942 and May 1943 all came fromthe same source. Clearly this makes analysisin Cairo extremely difficult. It was suggestedto O'Brien that to get over the difficultyof using a cover name me might give the sourcea letter. O'Brien replied that there were SO malmany sources that the alphabet was alreadyused up. This, was followed by a suggestionthat perhaps numbers could be used instead.Durt las seen foster and considerably shakenim on the question of the genuineness ofBunbury. Burt gave it as his opinion thatit was a true bill.There has been an interesting development inthe HOYSE case. Sir Archibald Lowlands, Perman-ent Under-Secretary of M.A.P. who was to havegiven evidence about his conversation withSir Sir Frank priggs whd told him that he hadgiven a warning to ARMSTRONG, is now conveniently going to America on important business, andSir FrankSprigg, reassured by this fact, isnot disposed to assist the prosecution. Thematter is not of much importance from thepoint of view of the case but is interestingS showing the herring-gutted mentality ofeople like Rowlands.Burt told me very confidentially that Kendalhad rung him up at his home and asked himto do a special job. Kendal did not wish him tosay nything about it to anyone. I told Durtthat I left the matter entirely to his diecre-tion but that if as I expected the matter hadsomething to do with police corruption, whichwas now under investigation, did not wish himCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1922him to do anything that would give the impressithat this office was being used as a kind ofGestapo on the police. burt told me laterthat he had been asked to cover a meeting whichhe was confident he could do without beingdetected. It was connected with a case ofcorruption. He had learned from Kendalthat the state of affairs within the policewas extremely bad. burt was definitely notsurprised. He told me that he had knownabout it for a long time. Chief InspectorSalisbury, Sergt.Nobl and several otherpolice officers have been sacked. These wereall connected with the STOCKMAN case but werecaught out on some other incident.lateI lunched with Col. .onrad, rad,/American Asst.

He had with him a MajorCarris and two other American officers.Lennox and 1 gave him as full a picture aspossible of our Second Front activities and ofour relations with SIS and SOE. I repeatedmy offer of a course for G. officers which wascordially accepted. Conrad said that whilehe was here in the capacity of a spy, hethought that he had a fair idea of the set-up of the British Intelligence Service, butthat having spent 4 years here since thebeginning of the war he was in a complete fog.I said that he had my entire sympathy. I amnot sure whether he was more or less confusedafter I had left him. He is a very nice chapand full of goodwill.I had a talk with Dick about Medlam. Afterwe got him back we might possibly offer hem aCatalogue Reference:KVI4/192/$3a Second Front job.I dined with Peter Reid. He would welcome arepresentative from our office on his committeeHe is almost violent about the stupidity inhandling intercept material. He thinks thatthe general caginess of SIS in the controlof G C & C S is a menace. They seem to forget,he said, that everybody is aware of the policynf intercepting signals. Even our own opera-corS were being constantly told to guardgainst it. The thing that matters is not thatwe are like everyone else doing it but theextent to which we do it.Cecil has wired to say that Corbally, EASTWOOD,and Adnrews have all been arrested.August 2lstI saw ADNI add discussed with him Medlam'sposition. It was agreed a) to give Medlam adressing down abouth his relationswith theSOI, and the Admiral, (b) to instruct theAdmiral to speak to Pyke-Nott, the SOI, and (c)to put the admiral himself into the picture,nd seek his co-operation. Medlam had readScherr's account of the Coaling Island incident_nd was satisfied that there was no case againsScherr for not reporting the matter earlier.I said that we would ascertain how far Brooman-"hite was getting over the difficulties withSIS and SOE. We were not inclined to entrusttheir information to Medlam. If this arrange-ment does not work we shall have to reconsidergetting rid of Medlam. Pyke-Nott cannot beCatalogue removed until eferencEkvagpnsation in the Mediter-ranean area takes place.this should be inthe fairly nearfuture.Peter Hope has got a reaction from the Asst.Supt. in Newcastle about Bunbury. He has beentold to stick to the line given to him forcommunication to the C..C.Kesselring has been made c.-in-C. SouthernItaly and Rommel has taken over in NorthernItaly.

The Jap Ambassador inBerlin has had a long conversation with Milch.Milch said that the Luftaffe was in considerab!difficulty as America was sending most of herplanes to Europe. Germany' monthly outputwas 2,700 first-line aircraft but it was hopedthrough her expansion scheme to double thisoutput in 15 months. american production wasestimated at 5,000 per month, Lngland and Canadaat 2,00 and USSR at 2,00. These figures werethought to include every type of plane. Clerw?I should say the British figures are an undearestimate. Between 3-4,000 would be nearermark. The efficiency of Soviet planes hadaccording to Milch fallen off. He admitted thatour raids on the Ruhr could not be lightlydismissed, and had had a certain effect onproduction. To meet this Germany was trying toimprove her A. A.defences and fighters, but thearea was extensive and it was not an easymatter. Considerable damage had been done tothe Messerschmidt works at Wiener Neustadt, dueCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19203to their having no fighter defence. roductiof bombers was not to be given priority atpresent. Danage to factories was regarded asroughly 10% of Germany' total production.T'he Jap summarises the position by saying thathe German nir Force was obviously veryleferior to the Allied, and that Germany hadggreat difficulty in the matter of defence.As no early improvement could be expected, itnust be recognised that the conduct of the wa.for Germany for the time being would bedifficult.August 23rdI had a talk with Dick and Dixon about thecourse of I.B and G.2. Major Carris of G.2has rung up to say that he would like 15officers to attend and would be glad if wecould let him know when the course would open.We have got out the synopsis, and are onlywaiting for the final arrangement to be madesoon as Dixon takes over his job in COSSAC.Burt and fish came to see me about the HARRIScase. We have got both HARRIS and his wife X1n letter check. HARRIS'S telephone on thelanding of his flat is alsoncovered.

He is perturbed about about a censor-ship report that 12 copies are being sent toLisbon. He is also worried about ADNI tellinghim that there had been an ISOS referenceindicating that the Abwehr were interested inthis publication. He thought he should haxtebeen told about it. I told him that I sarno particular object in stopping:the 12 copiessince although this might irritate theGermans slightly they could quite easilyobtain a copy through the Spanish Embassyor through America. Once they had one theycould have 500 copies made. I was not veryclear about the procedure in this case. NIDhad the censorship interceptt and they alsohad the ISOS. Surely they could link theto make up their minds. Bennett seemed tothink that it was his function to make uptheir minds for them. If this is only doneby getting me to make up his mind for him, itall seems pretty silly.T-R has written a very good noteon the Miatraffic. The present information seems tobe that it is valuable to the Germans and acaccurate. The XX theory has rather fadedout. When this service was being run on ISOS,rather tardily we gave the cypher keys tothe nussians. Meanwhile Max had gone over toISK. We have also given the tussians MirkoROT'S report. At least we assume that theSIS manin Mosco has done so, but wehave never heard what response he got. Thepatatogute efeeeraerws/taat we should give them(S2some sort of resume of the case and feed themout ISK as and when possible. The dangerabout giving them ISK is that we know that theircyphers are being read by the Germans. To do SOtherefore might compromise ISK.I am rather worried about the review of the DRS.it seems to me that this matter has notnbeengiven proper consideration by sections of the-ffice who should have views. I have justreceived a schedule of all the regulationsand have been asked to discuss them tomorrowat the D.G. S meeting. I shall have to saythat I regard this a S a matter of seriousimportance needing careful consideration.August 24thMcIver came to see me about an enquiry reBunbury that Hughes had received from thelocal SCO. I said that I thought Hughesshould tell the SCO exactly what he had toldthe C.C. otherwise he was putting the SCOvis-a-vis his subordinates in the same diffi-culty as the C C. would be placed. This meanta further spreading of the information.Dick, Ede and I had a conversation about Medlam.It was agreed that Dick should write a letterto Medlam and that Airy, who knows Gib. theGovernor and the new Naval C-in-0. should goout with the letter and try and smooththings over. Meanwhile Kirby Green should beordered back to take his leave.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/192At the Director's meeting today the D.G.referred to the future cancellation of DRS atspecified moments. He proposed to gothrough the whole schedule at 3 O'clock thisafternoon and to allot for further studycertain D.R.S to each Division. Jim Dalepointed out that many of these regulationsmight concern several divisions and that itmight be more profitable to get the viewsof the operative sections before proceedingfurther. TheD.G. said that this could be doneafter certain regulations had been referred tocertain divisions. I pointed out that travel,for instance, although a D.Division functionwas a matter which finally concerned B. DivisionLennox talked to us about operations. Hethought that Starkey had got somewhat out ofhand and that if we did not succeed in drawingthe Luftwaffe the Govt. would have a good dealto explain to a public which had been workedup to expect a big Second Front operationthis year. At the moment nobody appears toknow what has happened in Quebec. There isapparently no explanation at the moment ofthe ithdrawal of Litvinov and maisky andtheir suecession by two comparative nonentities]I am inclined to think that Russia is notanxious to participate in conversations because(a) we entered this war on a guarantee of theintegrity of Poland and (b) wey have signedthe tlantic harter. We know that the Russiansintend to violate (a) by re-occupying theCurzon line after the war and that they have nouse for the self-determinatior of small nationswafdlegteReference:(H49f9 concerned.These1$9matters are bound to come up at any conferenceand would clearly cause embarrassment to allconcerned. Russia would therefore prefer tokeep her hands entirely free.Deception regarding Norway is being continuedin the name of "Tindall" and regarding Brestin the name of "Wadham". the latter is anAmerican affair. Operations previously con-templated against Rhodes and Greek islandshave been postponed, indefinitely. The nextmove in Italy will be in the direction ofNaples.I attended the D.G.S meeting on the D.R.S.There did not appear to be any very controver-sial issues but a certain amount of discussionwith the H.O. will be necessary and also withthe D.P P. before we can give a final view onsome of the regulations.The S.1.S. report regarding Stilwell's positionin the Far East indicates that the latter isfaced (1) with the basic reluctance on thepart of the Chinese Govt. to assume theoffensive against Japan; (2) the hinese arenclined to rely upon the USA to defeat apan;(3) The Chinese desire to conserve materialrather than expend it; (4) attempts byChinese political factions to use him; (5) theabsence of a central hinese authority, whetherindividual or collective. with whom he candeal; (6) the lack of organisation, politicalfactionalism, incompetence, apathy and corrup-tion in the Chinese Army. In spite of allthese difficulties it is thought that bykeeping to the straight and narrow path heCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19(bomay succeed in overeoming them.On 17th August Denham telegraphed to say thathe was discussing the position in a mostfriendly way with Stephensonand would reportby telegram. He then asked whether he shouldcomplete his tour of the Caribbean, when hewould report his conclusions both to ourselvesand to Stephenson "who presumably will continueto represent MI5 interests in this hemis-phere. He could if necessary fly hom to givea verbal report after the conclusion of histour in the Caribbean. He has been told byDuff that no final decision with regard torepresentation of MI5 in the western hemis-phere has been or will be reached pendinghis retirn. He has been given permissiorto complete his tour of the Caribbean beforereturning, if he considers it desir ble.I had a discussion With vick, Victor and MissClay about the MARITA case. Dick was ratherin favour of liquidating the whole businesswith a prosecution, which he felt would actas deterrent. There are various difficultiesto this course; firstly it could not betaken without putting Jack in the box, seconulyI am strongly of opinion that it would createa bad impression both with the public andalso with the H.0. Although in my viewthere is nothing to which exception can betaken in war time, I am quite sure thatdefending counsel would make a great song anddance about the whole case and that we shouldbe dubbed as the Gestapo Dept, but in thismatter I should like to be guided by our ownlegal dept. Quite apart from this aspect ofalalogueReference:kV14/192the case I cannot see that we stand to gainvery much, since the marita organisation inits present form does not really constituteany danger. The information is handed to usand goes into a cul-de-sac. The advantage thatwe get from the case is that it supplies uswith information about people who would ifthey could do this country harm. When thewar is over they will clearly gravitatento right wing eireles and some of them atLeast will probably take part in the formationof some revolutionary right wing organisation.It seems to me therefore that our best policywould be to put in straight agents alongsidethem who will drift in the same directionin the post-war period and possibly be ableto inform us as to what is going on. Providedwe do not incur the odium of the public andthe H.O. I should not be averse to a prosecu-tion of 3 or 4, but I would still advocatethe introduction of straight agents since thecase obviously cannot run on its presentlines in peace time. am quite sure that aafter the war we shall have a good deal oftrouble both from the left and from the right,end somebody should be thinking about puttingn agents at the bottom and writing them off fo:a year or two when they may rise to a positionof some importance or to the post of secretaryto some important leader. Dick 1 think hasstill got a general impression that the caseis not of much importance and that we aredealing with a pack of hysterical women.Personally I think there is more to it thanthat. the basic ideas of the people we aredealing with are Fascist and they are workingCatalogue Reference:KV/4/192with the tools of anti-semitism, and anti-communsim, both of which may have a considerablappeal. I feel that if we just liquidatethis case without putting in some straightagainst we may be losing an opportunity. Itmay not be SO easy in the post-war period to geget into the movement which has already beenformed, at any rate it would probably takesome time.August 25thI saw Rymer Jones, who is going out to do ajob in the Palestine Police in conjunctionwith Saunders. He struck me as a sensible man.Kellar had a long talk with him in my presenceabout the present set-up in Palestine.There is no doubt that Kellar knows his jobwell. He rather anticipates the possibilityof trouble in Palestine before the end of thewar. The jews are well armed and it is quiteon the cards that they might try some sort ofcoup. This has caused anxiety in Arab circleswhich are again becoming active. it isdifficult to find out what the C.0. policy is.The F.O. on the other hand seem to be tacitly supporting the Fan-Arab movement. Jonesalso had a word with Victor who told him aboutthe sabotage cases at Haifa.At the Wednesday meeting today Ars.Spring men-itionedthat the agent HANSEN destined for thiscountry is being run by the Wuesbaden stelle.Joaquim RUIZ, 3rd officer on the "Cabo delHornas" plying between pain and D. America,has been pulled in when the ship was searchedat Trinidad. A transmitter he was taking toCatalogue Reference:KV/4/192b3B.A was discovered. RUIZ has been workingfor the German I.S. since March 1942, chieflyas a courier.William J.HEAP, the seaman who deserted hisship at Gib. has offered to carry out sabotagefor the Germans. They apparently have con-fidence in him and are trying to make use ofhim in that capacity.icado, previously reported as an interpreterto the British and american Legations in listbon but unidentified, has started reportingagain. He stopped reporting in May justabout the time that Dashwood was visiting ourmissions in Lisbon. Most of what he says isinaccurate.The S.D. in the Argentine is making strenuousefforts to obtain information about the UKthrough various diplomatic channels. They dond appear to be getting anything of importance.The indications are that they try to workthrough the Chileans and Argentinians.Milmo mentioned that Ferez GARCIA arrivedlast night at 020. He came by British war-ship from Panama.Kellar stated that MAYR, the German spy in Per-sia, had been arrested with another Germanagent who had come down by parachute. Thereare apparently 6 other parachutists at largein Persia.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/192lbuI discussed with Frost my note to Duff Cooperon signals security. I decided that therewas no point in raising the functions of RSSon the Second Front with the RSC until thestaff of COSSAC had given their comments.Attended the D.G. S meeting on the D.R.S. We hahave now completed our survey. L propose toget Jim Hale to explain the position torepresentatives of .Division tomorrow.Wilson and Mills came to see me about the caseof Springbok. His contact in Brazil, WALTHEMATHwas arrested in Brazil a month or two ago.The whole story has now been blown in the pressboth in south and north america, mentioningSpringbok's name and his alias. This hascaused a certain amo nt of embarrassment tothe RCMP who have told the press that he wasworking for the British S.S. MeanwhileSpringbok has been spirited away from Torontoto Montreal. SIS who were warned a longtime ago to make arrangements for his removalare now clamouring to have him sent hereHe will of course be a serious source ofembarrassment as he is not the kind offellow wholikes work. He is rather ofthe Tricycle type. First of all we shallhave to know from SIS precisely the terms onwhich they got him from Btazil to Canada. Theyhave been paying him $300 a month and theypropose to continue these payments. L do notthink that we can intern him since he hasreally done nothing to merit such treatment.If he appealed to the Home Secretary we shouldhave no case. Personally I would much preferCatalogue Reference:KV/4/192him to remain in Canada if this would not betoo embarrassing for the RCMP. It would ofcourse be necessary for SIS to go on payinghim. If in deference to Wood's wishes he isto come here we sh 11 presumably have to get hima job and keep him under some sort of super-vision.August 26thJim gave an acount to certain representativesof .Division of the tentative decisions maderegarding DRS. Milmo emphasised his pointabout the desirability of embody ing 12(5)ain some sort of permanent legislation afterthe war. Cecil expressed considerable appre-hension about the possible relaxation ofrestrictions on travel to and from Eire whichwould become a completely open door andstultify the arrival from enemy territory order.We shall have to remember too that at stage (a)there will still be a Jap begation in Dublin.Apart from these two matters the meeting seemedto be in general agreement with the veryprovisional arrangements laid down at theD.( S meeting.Sclater talked to me about RSS activities onthe Second Front. He told me in the strict-est confidence that they had 3 M.U.S which hadbeen carrying out exercises under McIntosh. Hedoes ndt however think that EHO latter is asuitable person to conduct a search, He alsotold me that RSS in d.f.ing an alleged beaconnear Lincoln had given an area of several hun-dred square miles in which the search would haveto be made. Their methods in d. f. ing conti-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/192nental stations were improving but theyreckon on an error of 1% per hundred miles.This would mean a transmitter could only belocated within an area of some 400 sg.miles.He also told me confidentially that hebelieved RSS were attempting to d.f.certainstations in F'rance which only came up fortesting periodically since they are believedto be those which will be left behind in timeof invasion. RSS have said nothing to usabout this officially. A1? this of coursewill have to come out when A get down toI.B.planning.Denham has written a letter to Duff Cooper inoonfirmation of his telegram in which hestates that he is inclined to think that theState Dept. is really the most important dept.with which we have to deal in America andshall have to deal with in the future. Healso says that if separate MI5 representation isconsidered necessary it might be achieved byhaving an officer in Canada who could visitthe FBI whenever he wished.Denham wired today to say that he thought inthe light of conversations with Stephensonhe had better come home SO that a final decisioncould be made about our representation in thewestern hemisphere. He thinks that he oughtto go out ag in to complete his tour of theCaribbean and to put the position clearlybefore the State Dept. and the FBI.A Jap B.J. indicates that by the 21st August 15German divisions had entered North Italy. Someof them have apparently come from the easternCatalogue Reference:KV/4/192167front but the majority are from south Germanyand France. It seems that whatever arrange-ments are made about Rome being declared anopen city the Germans intend to use the railwathrough it.A brief report has been received, of the meetirbetween Tricycle and the SIS representativen Lisbon. According to Tricycle,Jebbs andammler said that if he was not working forthe allies he must be a fool. NeverthelessISOS shows that whatever Jebbsen's own opiniormay be he is still making out to his superiorsthat Tricicle is a genuine agent. Tricycleis to return as soon as Lisbon receives theseal which has been prepared in Berlin toassist the e-Germans in forging a YugoslavbaTricycle also reported that there is onlyone agent in England whom the Germans thinkgood, and his symbol is PBK or PBH. So farthis is unexplained. Tricycle has givensome useful information about. the organisationof Einz Heer in Berlin and certain Germancode names. He has also given us the realnames of Karsthoff and Kammler.1e first four of Meteor's controlled lettershave ome-back from Lisbon as rebuts. Meteoris working as a XXX.

He feelsthat these have a very high significance asif we get into Germany we may expect theremnants of the Party to fight like wildbeasts. He is getting out a full reportwhich we shall have in a day or two. We shallthen have to decide about the disposal ofthebody. Personally I rather feel that we shouldnot judge German bestiality on the same linesas Russian bestiality. The Russi ns are a muchmore primitive and tough people, - whereas theGerman is bestial when he is top dog, butwhen he begins to feel that.h is Sbeaten he isapt apt-torc cringea and to -become sentimental.August 27thI spoke to Milmo about the case of Springbok;He agreeswith me that the first thing to do lSto get a clear statement of what has happened,the circumstances of his employment, and any-thing in the nature of an agreement which wasreached with him before he was taken on.Milmo thinks that if SPRINGBOK is brought herehe should be interned.

I also went into the questiof the security of non-service transmissions.I said that I thought a meeting should becalled of the RSC and that we should have a clstatement of the position.

It(70would be up o.the B.staff to state theirrequirements to Duff.We then talked about America, and I showedDuff a note written by Cyril Mills whichindicated rather well the kind of liaisonthat is required with the FBI. Puff readit carefully and said that a possible solutionwould be to place Mills in the Bureau andgive him cover of a similar kind to thatof Thurston, namely as a legal or otherattache to the British Embassy.L showed Duff some interesting Jap B.J.S andalso talked to him about the case of ZECH-NENTWICH in which he was very interested.Lhave promised-t give him a report as soon asit is done.I had a talk with Frost.

This would be open for about a week.He was turning over in his mind whether he shoutake it or whether he should wait for apossible job on the Second Front, which he +hthought would appeal to him. He had in mithe co-ordination of radio security forCOSSAC. I said that I thought since RSS wouldobviously be involved it might be a pityto carry the war between this dept. and theminto the I.B.Staff. He did not make muchcomment: I think probably the best thing is tomake it quite clear that the job on the I.B.staff would be of such a low grade and nebulouskind that it would probably not suit him. Ihave spoken to the G. who feels that FrostatalgeveereferrecerksV/419er he-Radio board.171Burt tells me there has been another post-ponement of the HOY SE case until the l6thOctober. Apparently there is a tremendousamount of wirepulling going on. I do notthink however that in the long run it willdo HOY SE any good.Victor had lunch with the Frof. today. Theyhad a long discussion about Do-Gerat. The Prof.akes the same view as Alan that if cordite8 the propellant SO much would be requiredthat it is bound to burn up the apparatus.He also thinks that the trials in the Balticwould have been bound to have been the subjectof comment by the Swedes. The whole thinglooks to him somewhat phoney,particularlythe evidence which has been supplied bySISandP/Ws.Another point is that the noseof the projectiles according to the photographstaken from the air at Peenamunde, is round.The Prof. says that a projectile of this kindwhich has to travel 150 miles and reach a'height of 45 miles, would have to have apointed nose and be stream-lined if it wasgoing to reach its destination. The point ofthe rocket is that it has no recoil, butthere is any propellant that can get itinto the air without burning up the wholeapparatus the only way out of the difficultyewquld be the catapult. This however wouldnot be a solution since a catapult would pro-duce a devastating recoil.I saw the D.G. today about Africa. He nowtakes the view that the changed conditions7mean that there is not really a big enoughCatalogue Reference:KV/4/192172job for Webster who has done everythingpossible on the security front. There isonly the intelligence side which includestheSITTIG case. This is being worked out asbetween Michael Ryde and Muggeridge. Hethinks therefore that Webster should be with-drawn and Ryde left to carry on. He haswritten to C. to this effect. C. I know willgive his cordial agreement.An informant of OSS in Berne has obtainedaccess to 3 messages from Dublin to the Germansrelating to GOERTZ. He has also had accessto certain other messages the nature of whichwe do not know at present, relating tocommunications or activities of Josephine.Presumably these messages have gone by the airroute via Stockholm. This is another illus-tration of the dangers of OSS operating ithouta full knowledge of "yn activities which areof course in the hands of G.2. We haveascertained from GC & CS that the mere findingout of 2 or 3 messages would not necessarilycompromise B.J.material. This si reassuringsince clearly the OSS agent will have togo on expressing interest in any furthermessages which may be handed to him. Theprevious incident of this kknd related to OSSactivities in the Jap Embassy in Rome.Marcus Hey wood tells me that 7 divisions, 3Briti'sh and 4 American, are coming back herefrom N.Africa, with all their landing craft, inNovember. This is apparently a Quebec decisionand may indicate that Second Front operationsare being pushed on.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/192(73August 28thBurt talked to me today about the job he didfor Kendal, which was covering a meetingbetween a police officer and someone engagedin the racket to obtain exemption from milit-ry service.

He points-out-manydifficulties, the principle one being thatne concern of the SOE section officer is toextricate his agent from a difficult positionThis policy would notbe consistent withdeception.

S suggestion a note was circulatedto the 3 Services and SIS on the work of theLRC with a request that they should expressa frank opinion. All the Services havereplied in glowing terms saying that they.do not wish any relaxation of the work whichis proving to be extremely valuable. Vivianon the other hand has thought fit to expressthe view that there is much meticulous and tot-ally unnecessary work going on which could beeliminated. He suggested that the majority ofthe cases could be dealt with by the SCO. Thiscomes rather ill from SIS seeing that the bulk O:of their Purple Primer is built up on. theinformation that iscarefully recorded at theLRC. Moreover Vivian's suggestion indicates.a lamentable lack of knowledge of the machineryif he thinks that nything in the nature of asatisfactory interrogation can take place atport.

The D.G. is proposing to take thematter up with Maxwell.August 29thMarriott came to talk to me about the proposalfor overt censorship of peninsula mails,preparatory toStarkey. I had previouslyraised the question with TAR about inform-ing the Americans. We are showing a teston 80-100% of the letters for A.V.. This meansthat all GARBO'S cover addresses will beblown. We do not mind this as it will(a) throw the Germans on to the air, (b) worrythem quite a lot and (c) give us some idea asto the reliability that they attach to eachagent. In this connection if they supplythem with a new address and new inks theywill obviously be doing SO because they thinkit worth while. There will be an interveningperiod when little communication ill takeplace but this suits us quite well as wedo not wish to have to answer awkeardquestions when operations are in preparation.The point I raised with TAR was that ouraction might have a considerable effect onthe Americans. First of all some of Garbo'saddresses may also be in use in the westernhemisphere and secondly if we are blowingthe re-agent for A.V. certain of their agentsusing this ink may be in difficulties.Whatever the effects, the gesture to theAmericans is a good one since it shows thatwe recognise that they have a stake in whatwe do over here. It may have the effect ofbringing it home to them that we are equallyCatalogue Reference:KV/4/192likely to have a stake in what they are doingin USA. they have recently blown the GraceBUCHANAN-DINEEN case and in SO doing have madeit clear that they have been passing informat:-ion through to the Germans after having it aapproved by themilitary and naval authoities.While the possibility of this must be amatter of common knowledge, to the Germans,there is no doubt that the less adidabout it the better. Had we had someonein the Bureau to impress them with thispoint of view the incident might not haveoccurred.Ronnie Reed tells me that the transmitter knowas Phoney which is somewhere in the Balticand got into touch with the Admiraltywireless station, is deveoping in quite aninteresting way. The indications are howeverthat Phoney is quite an appropriate name.By way of testing out this transmitter wehave asked for weather reports and havereceived a reply that these will be given.The reply came to us en clair. XAX If wedo in fact receive weather reports and theyare accurate we shall have to thinkagain. The operator has indicated to us thathe is known to a certain firm in this countrybut he may of course just be cashing in onthe identity of some P/W.Felix Cowgill has again distinguished himselfby telling Curry that Soviet espionage is nothis business. Curry has told him that hejoined SIS on the understanding that he workeddirect to Col. Vivian and that to try and makeCatalogue Reference:KV/4/192I7a hard and fast division between Sovietespionage and Soviet ubversive activities ispure nonsense. His minute to Gelix was insuch temms that it even madeabit uneasy. >he advised certain modification:but received the reply that the minute hadalready gone. Felix has also had a rasp-berry from herself. He told her that sheshould not on any account tell MI5 aboutthe Josephine messages and the Goertz message:Suill less should she refer the matter toDenniston without the hief's approval.She replied that she had alredy told MI5and that as regards the chief she was quitecapable of looking after her own affairs.Lastly Felix has written an extraordinaryletter to Melland about the Purple Primerwhich Melland had criticised from themilitarypoint of view. Felix had repliedthat these primers were prepared for avariety of customers. He seems however toignore the fact that the principal customersare the military, who might reasonably besupposed to be interested in having some sayin the form of the primer. ome peoplethink that Felix is going off his rccker. Herote to Dick the other day saying that "nowthat we knew that the Germans knew that weknew that duff is being used, would it notperhaps be a good thing to tell the censorshipAs we told the Censorship more than two yearsago there does not seem to be much pointin his remarks.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4 OF THE EPUBLIC RECORDS1958 Dee 2000Catalogue Reference:KV/4/192August 30thAccording to latest reports K.S.S. are takingabout 730 stations.

Thefact is that certain of Garbo's lettershave already reacted to the methelyne bluetest. This is probably due to the fact thathe is suing too strong a solution, and thathe uses a pen instead of the match-stickcovered with cotton-wool. This test has beengoing on since the 19th of this month. Weare letting one letter through with aslightnindication which might have passedthe eye of the censor that the letter con-tains secret writing. This may get usout of the difficulty of using tetra-baseif the Americans do not want to blow thisreagent. Tommy Harris thinks that whatevertest we apply we ought to go on the assump-tion that certain of Garbo's lettershave been read and to continue the testat any rate until the ink and cover addressare changed. Whatever happens L am surethat we are right in making the gesture ofconsulting the Americans in a matter of thiskind since it is only in this way that weshall get them to understand that whathappens in one hemisphere may well be impor-tant to investigating agencies in another.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/192(79We have had further meetings on the relaxa-tion of control of travel at Stages and B.Abbott has prepared a paper for discussionwith the H 0. which strikes me as beingsingularly inadequate.

He has papers as a British subjectbut we hold an order under LOB which wasintended for time of invasion but whichhas never been served. Maxwell suggeststhat we should keep the order in case wemight want to serve it any time.I went in afterwards to see Newsam. Iexplained to him the developments in PlanBunbury. He told me that MiSs Nunn hadbeen appointed to fill the position in theH.U. as expert in MI5 matters. She will beassisted by Mrs.Robinson who has worked forsome time on the Birkett Committee. Thisseems to me quite satisfactory at any rateas a beginning.Milmo tells me that a German called HAFFNERhas deserted from Spain where he was operatingone of the Bodden units.
