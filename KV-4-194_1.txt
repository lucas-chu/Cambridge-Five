In althese circumstances it was agreed that he wouldhave to leve Spain, if he could be persuadedto do so voluntarily.

I sat next to C. and had quite longtalk with him and also with Hastings. C. toldme that aillol was due to arrive here shortly.Whether he went back Nould nave to be a matterfor consideration. C. felt that as his unitscould not operate in the early stages it might bebetter for him to have arrived a bit later. C.is apparently passing communicatians to algierson behalf of Bonnefousse and receiving communica-Catalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/194377tions back from Paillol. This apparently doesnot altogether please B.C.R.A. who wish to takean injured line that communications have beenstopped. C. said that he did not propose to stopcommunications. It was of course open to theB.C.R.A. to ask onnefousse to show them anytelegrams that he received.C. then talked about an extraordinary incidentwhich had occurred in Italy. AnO.S.S. man namedPpra arranged a party consisting ofrincess PIENATELIE, who has been working forAmgot, and others to pass through the lines ina red cross van and proceed to Rome. How thiscould actually happen is a mystery. I believehowever th t ISOS shows that she did in fact gothrough and divulged a eonsiderable amount ofinformation to the Germans. Her husband hasapparently been acting as a spy behind our lines.While in Rome the rincess brought back FIOM-BINO'S wife. It looks therefore as if she hadimposed a plan on PIOMBINO to bring his wifeto safety as a cover for communicating informationobtained by yher her husband. She has I bellevegiven the ap roximate date of our next attackwhich is not altogether accurate.I talked little to ti stings, tho has of coursebeen in Washington dealing with "Y" materiilIHe asked me if I saw much of Vivian ind Cowgill.I said that I had not seen much of either of themlately, and rather wondered what was coming. Hethen said that Cowgill, although, a very energeticchap, had got a secrecy complex which amountedalmost to insanity. He had also got a maniafor canalisation. Hastings told me that he isat present employed in acting as a kind oflink Catalogue SguReference:KV/4Pfg4lo V and that in the328course of his duties he had suggested that ISOSand ISK m terisl sent abroa ad should go directfrom B.P. This had met with a loud protestfrom Section V ho said that B.P. would notknow how to interpret the messages. Finallyit was agreed that a copy of whatever vas sentshould go to Ryder St who sho should uild make theircomments. After this system had been in force3 months, Ryder StA had not made one singlecomment. I took the opportunity of sayingthat I thought too much secrecy could be areal danger, and that i1 a man was sufficientlytrusted to be given the information he should betold precisely what it was. I also said I wasvery much pposed to bottle-necks and that itwasextremely important to get users and producerstogether. Had this been SO in the past hoursof york might have been saved.After lunen I had a word with Arnoid-toster.I told him about ISNOR and the memo which L hadleft with C. I explained that it was not SOmucn the intrinsic value ofthe messages as thefact that Dick, as chairman of the RSIC with theresponsibility of assessing priorities, did notin fact know that the service was beingtaken. The other point was that the Serviceswho had received the informati n had beentoldthat on no account was MI5 to be informed. Thisseemed to be an unnecess iry blackbil ling oi ourdept. and obviously caused a good del 0f illfeeling. Members of my divisionycould not helpknowing about it and naturally took the view thatinformation to which they Nere properly entitledwas being delibetely witheld. arnold-ostersaid he would certainly look into the questionancatalogue Reference:KV/4/194379Arnold-Foster also had a conversation with DickButler about Gwyer which was quite iluminating.He pointed out that accusations had been madeoutside this dept. without reference to the D.G.Whatever the facts vere nothing had ever beenstated in writing.

I believetoo that they have recently sent another divisionthere, making a total of 13 divisions.May 9thI attended Findlater Stenart's committee on therefugee question. Representativesoi SHAEF,Home Forces, Newsam, Moy lan, Nere present. Thepoint for discussion was whether SHAEF anddome Forces were prepared to adopt our alterna-tive proposal that refugees should eventuallybe houed in hostels but that some sort ofperfunctory examination should be made. Wehad put in a P per showing precisely what thereasons were and stiting tht the only thingthat could give 100% security would be theinternment of these people pending their re-shipment to the continent. We did not howeveron a short term view rate the risks as beingCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/194380particularly high. After the experience of theprevious day's meeting it seemed almost impossib-le to get the necessary equipment and staff fora camp at Shoreham to hold 6, 000 refugees. Itseem extremely unlikely that we should ever getaccommodatio for 30,000 and that if ve did theconditions would be SO bad that the Govt. wouldbe forced to let them out before very long. Wehad therefore made up our minds to make thebest of a bad job. SAEF said that men.thiteley would like them all interned and HomeForces said that they would be guided by theSecurity Service. Note was taken of SHAEF'Sview but Sir Findhater feit that in the circum-stances there W S nothing to be done but acceptour alternative proposition. It was arrangedthat a m eting should take place tomorrow atCommand QReigate, of alt the parties coneern-ed, in order to discuss detail about the lay-out of the camp. We have decided to send Robband Vesey. e estimate that 90% of the peoplecoming into to the Shaeham Camp will be able bebe released ind since they all n ve to bedispersed after certain formalities have beencompleted, in London, it was sutgested.thatthe 10% doubtfuls should go to Battersea,there they will be further amined.

After examination suspects aresent to the CSDIC camp at Delni and if they areproven spies or very highly suspect they go tothe equivalent of Camp 20, the location of whichis kept very secret.

The Japanesehowever are training very large numbers andit is anticipated that there may be a certainamount of trouble in the future34un7Anthany toid me that Tomny llarris was extremelyworried about the Artist situation. He had astrong feeling that Tricycle should be llquidatedCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194382He thinks that this would have the effect ofpreventing any Germans from investigating Garbo.He is afraid firstly that Artist will underpressure say that he thinks that the Felipeorganisation is controlled. He also thinksthat if comparison is made of the traffic ofTricyele and Garbo it will be seen that theyboth point in the same direction. He feelstherefore that if the Germans know thatcycle is controlled they will more thanprob bly think that Garbo is controlled.

The only ones who weee notcaught in a very short time were those disguised.in Ameican military uniform. All the spieswere provided with faked documents and papers,many of them with quite obvious mistakes inthem, but those carried by the "Americns"were passed even by the American militarypolice.Brock said that Nelly KAPP, the seeretary fromthe German Legation at Ankara was being ruestion-ed. G.C & C.S. considered that her knowledgeof codes and cyphers would be of great value tothem. As she had only been in the post forabout 5 months, however, her general knowledgewould not probably be of much value on the whole.It appears that she was educated in the U.K. andin America, had lived for some time in India,and had spent very little of her life in Germany.Her father was in the German Consular Service.Brock said that the K.0. in Turkey was beingstrongly reinforced.Art Thurston turned up in his naval uniform.He is going to be here for about 10 days beforegoing to China, where he will work for OSS.Buster and I gave a t ll to S.B. down to inspee-tors and to CID superintendents.y This meetinghad been arranged by the YD.G. and Norman tendal,who was present. told the meeting about thebasic organisation of the Abwehr and S.D. andgave them a very brief outline of the developmentsCatalogue Reference:KVI4/194384from the period immediately preeeeding thewar up to the present day. Buster gave anextremely good lecture explaining first thatthe work we were doing and the information wewere collecting had very ide repereussions.For example, the case of HELMUTH had causedthe severance o1 diplomatic relations bet eenUSA ind the Argentine. +he Fortuguese Govt.owing to the case of MENEZES had been forcedto expel.a number of Germans engaged in espion-age, and similar action had been taken inMadrid on representations made by this eountry.He then went on to describe the various typesof spy who have come to thiscountry and ourmethods of dealing with them. T think that onthe wholethe party was a success. S.B. haveperhaps been rather neglected in the past,partly because there is a feeling that theywould not appreciate being tectured by usand secondly that being so near they knew morethan the other special branches. 01 coursethis is not the case. I thanked them for theirassist nce which the had so villingly givensince the outbreak of war and expl ined to themthat we were aware that some of the en quirieswe gave them were of a rather trivial nature.This rose from the fact that in times likethese we felt that we had to leave no stoneunturned and that we regarded it as innerentin our ork and taeirs that e only expected toget 1 1 of valuable information but were forcedto comb through the emining 99r in order toget it. I said that we felt that on the wholethis country had been kept pretty eean of spieduring the laste did not wisn toCatalogue Reference:KV/4/13563565be complacent however and i always had it inmind that when the war Nas over some alien villwrite a book saying that he had been a spyin England for 4 years.I had a long iscussion with AR,J.C. andTommy on the situation that nas arisen owingto the removal by the AOWENR of Artist toBerlin for detention. Tommy is stillextremely apprehensive and think littletoo inclined to imagine that the Bosche willthink as we tink. E am personally againstanyydeparture from the policy wnicn has beenvery ably argued by J.C. He recommends (a) thatwe continue to run the Tricycie traffic inthe same style as before and with as littlech nge as possible, but that no cover for thedeception should be put over on it. (b) thatthe other agents continue for the time beingexactly as at present. (e) if Ne get informationthat the situation has deterioratec the agentsshould be used to ill tne German mind withconfusion insteadof passing over a completecover plan, and (d) th t if and only if theblowing of Tricycle and Garbo is certain,we close down alt agents shortly before D.dayand deny all information DO the enemy. lommy'sgrounds for thinking that Garbo may be com-promised are rather that we know that Artistthinks that all Felipes V-men in this countryareunder our control. He reported these factsto us and did not for obvious reasons get avery strong reaction. We took the hine thathe should not endanger his position by pokinghis nose too much into other people's affairs,Catalogue Reference:KV/4/194381and that the probability was that most of Feli-pe's V-men were figments of elipe's imagination, and therefore not worth bothering about.It is doubtful owever whether Artist hasaccepted this view since he has continued inhis conversations to assume th t Felipe'sV-men are under our control. He cannot becertain about this, but he may express thisview to the Germansunder duress. The otherreason is that if the Germans make acomparison of Tricycle's and Garbo's traficthey wiil see the they both point in the samedirection. We are having a comparitivet tablemade out because we are on the whole ratherdoubtful whether this deduction could be made.In any case if you do get a particular regimentor H.Q. Q. pin-pointed by both of them, it doesnot necessarily mean that if the Germans knowone of them is controlled they will assumethat the ether is also, particularly since theinform tion given by Tricycle has beenfpickedup by "/T inteligence. lommy thinks that ifthe Germans review alt our traffic over thelast few months as was done recently by anofficer with an entirely fresh mind, they willme to the same onclusions as he has. Thismay or may not be SO. Somebody else, ,readingthe traffic, might place much more epphasison look one at thing this case than it another. is full Whichever of impanderabies way youand my feeling is that it would be a mistaketo move at this moment in any irection. Oneought to get some reaction as regards Artistfate from watehing any communic tions to Bel-grade by Tricycle's brother. He should alsoget some reaction if Berlin started enquiringCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/194387into the affairs of Garbo's organisation fromMadrid. I feel certain th t if we were toclose down Tricycle at this stage it would bejust as likely, if not more likely, to callGarbo into question than otherwise. There isthe addition l factor that suen action wouldundoubtedly put Artist completely in the cartand seriously jeopardise Tricycle's brother.While I think the odds are much in favour ofthe Germans eventually coming to the con-clusion that Tricycle has been contoolled,I was not in favour of giving them any assis-tance in coming to this eonclusion which maywell take them some time and get us over thecritical period.May llth thHarry Allen called a meeting with Shean, Barry,Cussen and myself to discuss the Question ofjournalists who are to take part in the SecondFront.

Snean nimsell had been infavour of the journalists being arned on aboutD-12 hours, but he had been over-ruled bythe Chiefs of Staff who decided on D-4 days.We all felt ta tat this arrangement was badnd badfraught with considerable danger, since itwas inevitable that the whole of Fleet St.being on their toes, the information might le tkto a neutral journalist and weyhad to expectthat since the ban on diplomatic communicationshad been enforced Embassies would probablyhave some arrangement with one 0f their journal-ists to get the news across in code.ICatalogue Reference:KVI4/194THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3863 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958.900oempnasised strongy that "haever away werefixed, it Was highly necessary to considercarefully tae precise instructions given tojournalists.

Thefact that an airborne division has been movedinto the area is confirmed on M.SS. Weare getting out a paper for the JIC who dealtwith sabotage some time ago in a rather light-hearted way. We took exception to the paperheyproduced as being somewhat misleading. butthey refused to accept our amendments. Some6 months ago there wis a paper by the Chiefsof Staff rather writing off anything in thenature of airborne or seaborne raids. I verymuch doubt whether if 250 parachutists camedown in Hyde Fark or Bushey Bark there would beany troops there to deal with such a situation.J.C. and Dick Butler went over to see Viv. thisnorning about Gwyer.

When327Viv said "Well, that's a matter of opinion",J.C. said that his opinion of Ryle was based on20 years intimate association whereas Viv'sopinion of Gwyer was based purely on hearsay.Again, Viv. said "We have our troubles of asimilar kind. Youtwould not have liked it ifwe had imposed T-R on you." He implied that weshould have found T-R a very difficult customerto deal with.J.C. with. J.C. said that he had dealt withT-R for 2 years and found no difficulty inhandling him at all. Viv. however stuck tohis point that this was not a question ofevidence. It was merely a feeling which existedand could not be eradicated. He said that C.did not intend to have a row over this matterwith us, but that he was still of the opinionthat things would work better if Ne did notmake the appointment. Both J.C. and DickDutler told the D.G. that in the Right of thisattitude they did not see how we eould forceGwyer on SHAEF and that the only thing to do wasto explain the position and make another bidfor John MairIngrams rang me up about SCHRADER, a Dutchnanwho came out of Holland last October.

Kendal rather gave those presentto understand that we were perhaps a bit com-placent. We had told them all about theinefficiency of the Germans but we nad saidnothing about any operations which they hadearried out successfully. This remark evident-ly caused quite a lot of ill-feeling. In factGill came up to me immediately after themeeting and said "Sir Norman never seems tobe able to avoid having a dig at somebody"Harry nad a meeting on Overlord security.Cussen drew attention to the frequent speculations by the Press on the date and place ofthe operation which was based on news publishedeither by the Germans or under foreign date-lineThe danger of this was that it encouraged peopleto speculate ab a time when we were doingeverything in our power to restrain themfrom doing anything of the kind. It was alsoevident that sooner or later the actual datewould be hit. If this vere after the briefingperiod the troops would have the impressior thatthere hadbeen a leakage to the enemy and theirmorale would suffer accordingly. A particularlybad impression would in any case be caused at atime when they were being urged in every possiblquarter to keep their mouths shut.

I went over theground very carefully. rather dismissed theevidence of Bothereau who is under arrest inNAfrica which did not seem to me to have muchsignificance. Bothereau met Fino originallyat the training centre ind later outside Montet'soffice. On that occasion according to Fidoothereau asked him to come aind see hi at theHotel Avia. Fido went there but found thatCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/1944Bothereau nad gone. Montet, seeing the tro menwere acquainted ith one another, nas ratherconcerned, but told Fido that Dothereau haddone several jobs for nim. Dothereau's accountis that Fido told him thathe had just got ajob which would take him either to England,JSA or N.Africa. Fido never mentioned thisin nis statement. This round no ever be quitea natural thing for him to say if he nad beeninformed by Montet that Dothereau was inthe game. I then discussed the tatement inFido's letter to his parents that ne hoped thatthey had been getting his parcels. I ratherwondered what these parcels vere. Are parcelswhich aresent as from a postbox in Lisbon Likeletters also subjeee to eensorship? anotherpoint was the weakness of Fido's cover story.Was it possible that the Germans nad neverbothered much about it as they really intendedFido to plant himself on us and then XX us?These are otherpoints which should be weighedagainst the gener L impression created by idoand the fact tt he is now engaged to anEnglish girl. In general there seems to besome element of doubt about the case althoug bthe odds are that even if Fido had intendedto earry out his assignment, he gave up theproject before he made his stateinent at theLRC. It seemed impossible to send him eitherto North or "est Africa,hussia or Canada. Itwas therefore for consideration with W/C Chaneyhow he could best be disposed of durine thenext month or so. The point to be aimed atwas to ensure that in so far as it miht behumanly possible he did not get into a planean Catalogue Refererce:KV4/194territory.itwas5further necessary toensure that he got no accessto operational nformation of any kind and thathe was as far away from the zone of operationsas possible.Findlater Stevart led another meeting todiscuss communications to and from Iceland.itseemed from the discussion that in fact sincethe 17th April there have been no ciphertelegrams and that en clair messages vere allcensored in Iceland ind in this country.There was however communication with the USAby ireless, but tiris was censored locally.Movements of ships were gone into and alsofishing craft.

Its contents nave been sent on itha high priority to Hansen in Berlin. The gistof the message is that Freak, who is Tricycle'swireless operator,here, is working for theGermns. Similar information nas reaenedSUE through Mihailovic. This gives us anopportunity of closing down Tricycle's trans-mitter, at any rate temporarily and may pos-sibly assist Artist. The Germans might quitenat rally think that Mihailovic nad passedthe nformation on to us or even that we hadpicked it out of the air and leeyphered ithile being transmitted by Mihailovic to hisDMI. Our natural reaction wouid be to get onto Freak and for him O ing to his anxiety toclose down further transmissions. Tricyelewill write a letter which the Germ ns will notget for some 6 Weeks telling them that therehas been trouble for Freak id that for tatreason he felt bound to stop communicating.If we see from the traffic that Artistis once more on a good wicket we can go onthe air again and explain the trouble by wire-less, tating that the difficulties have beengot over and that Freak nas come successfullythrough his interrogit tion. This arrangementof course will be very acceptable to TommyHarris, who is anxious to dissociate Garbofrom Tricycle's aifairs.

Harry Allen is going to see A.G. itha view to getting things tightened up.Mayear I9thThe cyphers used by Brutus and Treasure haveenabled G.C. &c C.S. to break another extremelyimportant group.Catalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/194I spent a good de: of the morning goinginto the significance of the recent indicationsth t Garbo is to receive certain questions, theanswer to waieh are to be despatehed by specialpriority to Berlin and the Abwenrkommando inArras. I spoke to Brooks in Melland's sectionin order to find out what the significanc ofArras Was. It seems that there is adirectlink from Arras with Corps 65 of the Zbv.Brandenburg Regiment. Apart from thisthere is no very satisfactory ex lanationas to why ast Arras nas been established.There is also inform tion d ted 24th Aprilto the effect that the Jap MA reported to hisGovt. that 65 Hrmy (believed to be Corps) isHitler's anti-invasion unit. The J.I.S. paperon the subject of possible commando raids nereis a little inclined to. write off the possibilityIt is wever difficult to explain preciselywhy the Germans snouid ask not only for thetown but also for the street and number in thestreet of various headquarters, if they do notcontemplate a landing and subsequent attackon the ground. There is just a possibility ofcourse that they may wish to have the streetand number in order to sort out the veiterof reports that they are probably receivingmostly of a notiona Kind, particularly il thereare more than one headquarters in the same to n.I gather from RSS that Garbo's cypher is beinggiven to Arras so that his inform tion can betransmitted from Madrid to Berlin and on toArras without any re-cyphering.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/1941I attended a meeting of the JIS with Victor,and I think that they are just a little bitshaken. Winterbottom who is representing SiSsaid that ne had very derinite evidence of aconnection n between Arras and Crossbow.Arras is apparently the headquarters of Cross-bow. Te pointed out however that it did notnecessarily fortow that Arras might nave etherprojects than Crossbow but which might be ofa commando ty pe. Apparently in immense numberof lines are running into Arras which from thepoint of viewof an underground headquarterswould be idmirable. When I was there in thelast war it was oney combed with chalk tunnels.Some of the celrars in the to n are extremelydeep and hewn out of the solid chalk. You canburrow dowr to almost any depth. We actuallyhad in underground rallway from Arras to thefront hine in the last war, and undergreunddressing stations to hold up to 70u wounded.Victor and f concentrated on trying to get theJIS to draw attention to tiNo factors, one thenecessity of adequate precautions at the varicusheadquarters and secondly the possibility ofparachutists dressed in allied uniformsof one kind or another. Boththese points wereincluded in the final draft whicn is to go tothe Chiefs of Staff. The JiS cannot howeverstatevery positively what they think ougnt tobe done as they are only an intelligence body.It is to be hoped that somebody'll nave thesense to take the necessary ction.

They had asked theirrepresentative at SHAEF to get Gen. hiteleyviews which they hoped to her t this morningneeting. Sir f indlater was son a Cory ofmy letter to him suggesting that somethingon the lines d the following SCheme should aloneensure -any-.degree of security : (a) ali journal-ists taking part in the operation should beinformed now that they should be on U hoursnotice; (b) they should be warned that they hadCatalogueaReferengekVitn94 their service kit,already deposited, extra clothing which theygocould leave behind as they would be remainingin the marshaliing area for soie considerabletime before their de} rture, (c) they shouldin fact be called up 12 hours before theoperation is due, to take place, toid to reportat some suitable rendezvoud, and be ken downto the area in buses; (d) while in the areathey should not be allowed to communicate bytelephone; (e) after tneyare called up, thestrietest possible eensorship snouid beimposed on all outgoing press cables, whichshould be heavily paraphrased. An alternative,to avoid any possibility of code, thoughperhaps somewn t extravagant one, would be tosend the cables o1, for example, the ChicagSun to the NeW York Herald, and vice versa.It is of course important that there should beno interruption in the normal ilon OI presscables. Major Goudie pointed out that therewere already press presentatives being usedin the marshalling area. It was of the highestimportance to get them back before briefing day.Ishowed Findlater my note about PWE ind blacksendera and he agreed that the situation wassatisf ctory.I saw Cneney about SCHRADER. He is going tothrow a fly over Dirksman and find out theposition.There is still no indication that Artist asmade any confession or that the Abwehr havecome torealise the true position in theTricycle case.Catalogue RefereNCe:KVI4/19421The Portugtrese Imtermationat Poice havehanded to SIS in Lisbon a statement aboutTricycle in which they come to the conclusionthat he may be either a British or a Russianagent.Bronx has received a further monthly ay ment0f 19 from the Germans.We are still waiting for a full report ofHamlet's meeting with "erner in Madrid.

He did not know aboutthe new Garbo Stichiing messages and was muchinterested by what I told him. I have arrangedthat he will in future be kept informed throughthe War Office representative on the TwentyCommitteeI had a long talk with Michael Ryde. From whathe say.s I very much doubt Nhether there is any-thing much to ergained by his going back toCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19422.Africa. Firstly the .Africans are practical llyout O1 the war That is the general atmosphereof the Union apart from Smuts and his immediateentourage. The police are without doubt ridiiedith O.B. and it is quite clear that they c nnotbe made use of in any way. Nobody knows thisbetter than Smuts himself. Smuts is relying toa very large extent on the support of certainfrikaans elements in the Union and if he vereto come out into the open to attack van Rens-berg and the O.B. he would probably get thecountry up in arms against him. ith this inmind his sole concern is to keep Africa inthe Empire because he thinks it is the bestthing for S.Africa and bec use if .Africa ventout of the war she would not be able to give uscertiir facilities which we non enjoy. Lentonwho has ritten to the D.G. in glowing termsabout Michael Ryde has been giving us all thesupport in his power. He has most of the policechiefs on telephone cheek and the results havebeen extremely helpful and illuminating. Itappears that the O.B. element of the policeare aare of the efforts that have been made toround up SITTIG and PAASCHE and of the extent tohich the O.B. is involved. Nild as undoubtedlyplanted by SITTIG and co. on Michael Rude.It was his intention to discover just ho muchwas kno n against him. He did n t get very farith this. He was told to go away and find out ththe whereabouts of SITTIG and to report to Ryde.He in fact did practic lly nothing until Rydeput Lenton's agent in touch with him. The agenttold ild that Ryde knew a great deal bout him irand knew that he vas implic ted up to the hilt.As ild vas cle rly playing about he decidedCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1948to get the police to arrest him. Lenton's agenturged wild in his own interest to come clean withRyde. This had the desired effeet but ildonly came clean as far as Rooseboom and vanRensberg were concerned. He produced the Roose-boom document and wireless transmitter both ofwhich are damning evidence against the e0.B.After this he disappe red. Rooseboom has alsodisappeared. It seems not unlikely that theymay both have been kidnapped. Wid did notdisclose anything about what happened afterSITTIG took over from Rooseboom and was toldthat the evidence as far as it went was all rightbut therea a great deal ore which ne hadnot disclosed. and that he was there fore regar-ded as unsatisiactory. It was t this momentthat ne disappeared. It seems that Baston hasbeen told a certain amount by de Villierswho made a complete muddie of the attempt toround up the transmitter.Michaed Rydeha beenrunningall the agents for SIS (Seetien V)in Lorenzo marques owing to differences betiveerthe SIS and SOE men, which made work almostimpossible.Dick,TA and I had a t lk ith the DG aboutcertin appointments.

There is some point in this. Atthe same time we all know the difficulties ofrunning our sections in halves. Unless we areabsolutely forced to do so, it is a thing to beavoided. TAR thinks that proactically the wholeof our work could be just as easily done fromthe country. I very much doubt this, as longas other offices remain up in London. He alsothinks that we will not be able to have papersat Chancery Lane. If we are not going to havepapers there is obviously no use going thereat all. AII this of course has been gone intobefore and the decision was taken on a highlevel that there was bo be no evacuation inanticipation of Crossbow. This was ofcoursebefore the matter had any publicity and whenit was known only to a very small circlewithin the office. It was felt at that timeto be of paramount importance to do nothingthat might create unnecessary panic. I shallbe raising this matter with the D.G. meanwhileI see no ojection to people going to thecountry if it is not going to interfere in anyway with their work.I attended a meeting at Norfolk House whichrlasted 2 hours. Gen. Davis, DPR SHAEF, Herbert,Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19427Admiral Thompson, Harry Allen, Cussen and myselfwere present. SHAEF have apparently worked outthe details which have been approved by Bisen-hower as regards the calling up of journalistsfor the Second Front. We questioned the periods,namely D-6 for airborne troops, D-4 forground troops, D-2 for naval personnel. Wewere told that circumstances varied accordingto the areas and according to the Services,and that these periods were to some extentelastic. Some people may be called up for air-borne troops on 196 andsome later. Gen. Daviscould not however tel us very much about anyof the details worked out by the local commanders.As it is largely on these details that theeffectiveness of any scheme must depend, onewould have thought that SHAEF would have takenthe trouble to find out what the local arrange-ments were. L have no doubt however that as aresult of this meeting they will make enquiries.At the moment the whole thing looks to me a littletoo sketchy. Plant drew attention to the factthat as far as airborne troops were concernedthere did not seem to be any arrangement bywhich journalists would be kept within theperimeter of the camp.-aving dealt with the question of the calling upof the journalists who were actually going onthe operation, we proceeded to discuss thepossibility of information reaching more importantjournalists in London from any source and thedeductions that they would inevitably draw fromthe absence of their war correspondents. If weassume that Fleet Stl knew the date but not thetarget, was there anything more that could bedertalogurryeterertce.kvf47Pg4 reaching papers28in America or in neutral countries. Could theircommunications be heavily paraphrased. AdmiralThompson seemed to think that this was impos-sible and both he and Herbert drew attentionto the fact that they could give no guaranteeas regards code, although Herbert at any ratewas doing his best to detect anything of thekind. Thompson on the other hand is generallyinclined to put a halo round the journalistshead and to discount any possibility ofhis attempting to get the news out. Herbertrather torpedoed this idea by referring tosome information that he had just received fromFrancis in USA, to the effect that some eodein broadcastig is to be put into effect. Hehoped to have the full details before long.Lastly we discussed the possibility of delayingtelegrams to neutral capitals. This raised theoad question of the importance of British newsin neutral capitals. If we did not get in firstthe news is invariably distorted to our dis-advantage. Personally L think this is averyover-rated idea. I doubt very much whetherat a time like this it would make the slightestdifference if neutral capitals were deprivedof some ofrour news, or received it at alater date. Certainly when weighed against thepossibility of the consequences of any leakagesuch consideration seems to me wholly insigni-ficant. The only danger to my mind in imposingsuch restrictions is that it is, too late. Theymay at this stage pin-point the time of theoperation, particularly if considered inconjunction with tides, moon-periods etc.The whole of the above discussion is beingCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19429embodied in a note which will be sent to SHAEFand which will at least cause them to look intothings a little more carefully. I doubt whetherat this llth hour we shall get any materialchange in the present arrangements.One of our Icelandic spies who arrived a weekor SO ago was in all probability trained byZIGZAG in Oslo. The description of thetrainer has been given in some detail andcorresponds accurately with that of ZIGXAG.Moreover ZIGZAG'S former master is now inOslo. This does not necessarily imply thatZIGZAG hasgone wrong. Obviously having goneback to the Germans he would have to swim withthe stream. May be he is angling for a jobover here which he may in due course succeedin getting.The proposal to create a Free German Movementin the UK with von THOMA at its head has beenfurther onsidered and an approach has beenmade to the General. From CSDic reports it wouldappear that the view of the Generals is that(a)since the war is lost, the vital question isto prevent chaos in Germany which must beexpecyed when the crack comes; (b)chaos willproduce communism which is the ultimate bogey;(c) they are all interested in Germany and itis therefore essential to preserve at leastpart of the army intact to prevent chaos;(d) it is upto the British Govt. to lay downtheir policy SO that a programme cam be plannedin conjunction with the senior group-commanderswhich will be of service to Germany and also toEngland; (e) broadcasting from behind barbed wireis only niggling and absolutely useless untilanyallapse.Major-General3oBASSENGE later told the British officer whohad discussed this question that Germany hadlost the war , that the crack might come beforethe Allies were in occupation, that it wasessential to avoid total coalapse and toensure that the allies arrived in Berlinbefore the Russians, and that a plan should bemade whereby the Germany Army in the westreturned to Germany, weeded out the Nazis andleft the anti-Nazi bureaucracy in power, thusavoiding total administrative collapse. BASS-ENGE said that in nocircumstances would hebroadcast at this juncture, but without anyconditions whatsoever, even retaining his P/Wstatus, he would be prepared to try and con-tact Rundstedt with the support of the BritishGovernment. In the strictest secrecy hestated that the advisability of abandoninga hopeless position had been discussed by agroup of senior German commanders some 18months ago. All except one were in favourof over-throwing the Party and giving up thewar.Rundstedt was present at this neeting.Dick spoke to me about PAILLOLE. He is veryanxious that he should be allowed to returntO N. Africa and he had head that C. was goingto see en.Bedale-Smith on the subject thisafternoon. I spoke to C. who confirmed thisand I told him that we supported the proposi-tion. In fact we felt that it was essentialthat he should go if the plan worked out withthe .B.Staff was to be really effective.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19431I attended a meeting at the F.0. where wediscussed a number of cases of diplomats whowere anxious eitherot to come to this countryor to leave it.I raisedthe question d PALLLOLE. Findlatertook the view that this was a matter for SHAEFand that if they backedthe application thecase need not go before the committee. Therewas a note on the agenda asking SOE to reportthe result of their investigations about theposition of the French in Algiers using Russiancyphers for communication with this country. Itseemed that the suggestion was based almostentirely on surmise. There was some evidenceto suggest that communication was going on andalso that the French were in fairly close touchwith the Russians. There was nothing howeverto show that in fact Russian cyphers were beingused.Findlater talked about the abolition of thediplomatic ban He said that the P.M. had tosome extent sold the pass by telling thePresident and also de Gaulle thatcommunicationswould open up immediately after D.day. Hehad however put forward a paper expressingthe anxiety of the various departments concernedparticularly SHAEF. He had not however over-stressed the argument that the abolition of theban would be detrimental to the cover plan.TheH'.O are apparently taking the line that ifthere are cover operations the more the Germansget to hear about them through diplomatic cablesthe better. Personally I doubt the soundnessof this view. I do not see how the Germans candraw any other inferenge than that .dayCatalogue Reference:kV14/I9439operation is the one and only one.Hill, Cunliffe-Owens! solicitor, hastold L.A.Byrne andthe Solicitor General thathe is worried about HOYES. He thinks thathe ought not to be at large in the banned areaand is inclined to believe that he may be aspy. The A.G. was informed and sent for JimHale. Dick Butler is going down to find outexactly what Hill's information is. I amquite certain that HOYES is merely anunscrupulous crook. It is reported that hehad both Eisenhower and Monty to dine at hishouse, and it mightbe just worth while tohave them warned. HOYES continues to live on alavish scale at his country house,MarwellHallMay 25thWe made arrangements two or three weeks agothat S.Division should have a general check-upon all doubtful released from the LRC. Theobject was to find out whether they wereemployed and where and with they were associa-ting. Beaumont accordingly wrote to S.B. aboutCa man called de la FER. Our odd friendInspector Cain was deputed by S.B. to go downand interview de Ta FER. He did this incharacteristic tyle, hectoring and bullying.The result has been a complaint by TheodoreGoddard & Co., de la FER'S solicitors, to theH.0. It is a wonder to me that Cain has lastedSO long. He is of coursea lunatic. On lookingat the file I was amused by Tin-Eye's openingremarke in the yellow peril summingup"De la FER is a hyper-sensitive bastard whoCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19433arrived here in a canoe. Once this isunderstood, the case of this shabby individualfalls to the ground".CX. reports indicate that there is a sharpdecline in German morale. Some 60% are saidto be convinced that the war is lost, 25%believe that some miracle will take place tosave Germany without actually wishing for thevictory of Nazism, 15% believe absolutelyin the victory of German arms and Nazism.The bombing of Bavaria and the Rhineland appearsto be regarded more as the responsibility of theGerman Govt. than of the British or Americans.Buster has produced a note on the recentarrivals in Iceland. Prior to April this year ththe enemy had sent over 3 espionage expeditionsto Iceland in the course of the present war.All three had been Abwehr enterprises. Thefirstinvolved a Norwegian by the name ofSAETRANG who madea passage from Northern Norwayin a boat accompanied by genuine refugees. Thisman committed suicide before he was interro-gated. The second expedition involed thelanding of the XX agent Cobweb by submarinein the Spring of 1942, and the 3rd, theXX agent Beetle who was landed by similar meansin the early autumn of 1943. The latter halfof the month of April this year, has been markedby the arrival in Iceland of no less than 7new enemy agents. These agentsycarried betweenthem 6 wireless transmitters and came in 3 par-ties from Bergen, two by submarine and one bysmall boat. Two of the parties were despatchedby the Abwehr and one by the S.D. They were allofatafogiendreferehienRviangexcept one FRESENIUS,34who was a German. the S.D. pair had instruc-tions to report on weather and allied troopovements and shipping. The two others inaddition to reporting on weather for whichthey vere equopped inter alia with barometers,had orders to send information on the presenceof troops,landir craft for invasion, numberof ships in the fjords, keeping a specialwatch on certain harbours. The third partyhad the usual instructions with regard toweather reporting and were also requiredto report on shipping, particularly forinvasion purposes, troop movements, divisionalsigns and other matters. One of them, theGerman, who appears to be a convinced and ardentNazi, incidentally the first we have encounteredhas stated in terms that the Germans areexpecting that invasion may be coming fromIceland. 5 of the 7 agents were recruitedas far back as 1942, the other two beingrecruited the following year. They have allhad extensive training although the wirelessefficiency of one or two leaves a good dealto be desired. The agents have roughly$3-4000 each in their possession.Thefirst"VO parties were captured within a comparative-ly short time after their arrival, andprotest that they never thought of operating.The 3rd party however were at large for over aweek before they were captured and have nowadmitted that during this time they madeattempts to establish contact with the enemyby W/T. These cases affort positive evidencethat the enemy is anticipating an offensiveoperation of some magnitude to be launched fromIceland at some not far distant date. The factthat thatabgte both eferARYghVPAIgthe S.D. are in the35field suggests that the idea is not confinedto the Intelligence Services but may well beoccupying the minds of the OKW itself.We have of course for some time been runningthe deception plan which implies an attackon Norway. Brutus, and Garbo, have beenactively engaged on this. Bevan asked theRussians to co-operate when he was in Moscow.They were enthusiastic bt we have no detailsof what they are doing.I saw Walter Bell today with Cecil. We dis-cussed the case of MARLIN in the light of theP.M.S S directive that conversations with Ameri-cans were only to be conducted on special linesof mutual interest. MARLIN seemed to be goingoutside his sphere by seeking for informationof a political kind both here and in Ireland.Welter Bell took the view that MARLIN was con-sidered to be rather a joke in his own organ-isation and we all agreed that it would be amistake to get at loggerheads with USS. Wedecided therefore to pursue the line that inview of the P.M.S directive we could not givepurely political information. If MARLINpersisted, we would take up the question withBruce.Cussen tells me that the Daily Mail had got acamera with a telescopic Tens fixed up in ahourse at Seaford.

It would however be helpful to thoseconcerned with security if they knew whatwas going on, since this is the first bigimpact on security machinery. The limitednaval personnel who have been briefed are notconfined to their ships but can proceed to anarea within 20 miles. The possibilities efleakage are therefore considerably increased.Victor and I visited Villiers' office andexamined with him his key-point maps, whichwere very elaborate and well set out.They showall the marshalling areas, petrol pipe lines,A. A.A. A. guns sites, balloon barrages,e etc. allround the coast. Villiers said that a big riskwas being taken by the Chiefs of Staff who hadwritten off the possibility of an attack onour midland industrial areas via the east coast.The position is that there are hardly anysearchlight or A. A.A. A. guns to defend that area.Considerable precautions have been taken againstCros.sbow by means of belts of balloon barragesand A. A. guns. Villiers was high in his praiseof Pluto and Phoenix.

There seems littleCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19439doubt that the most important targets are thepower stations which could very seriouslyaffect operations if they were put out of actionMay 27thI spoke to Cecil of SIS about the case of Missde JONG who is being tried in Berlin forassisting British airmen to escape fromoccupied territory. L gather that her fatherhas since been arrested. Some attempt was madeto effect an exchange with My ERICKSSEN about6 months ago but negotiations were allowedto fall into abeyance owing to the arrest ofthe father. S.I.S. are now anxious to re-openthe ball through the Swiss Government. Beforedoing So they want to know whether we are stillprepared to let My ERICKSSEN go. I said thatas far as we were concerned there was no ob-jection. At that time SOE had also agreedbut since then they had raised very seriousobjections to the release of anyone who hadbeen in contact with Victoire. They thinkthat any information going back from here mightaffect her agents in the field. This allseems to me to be a little far-fetched andto pale into insignificance wher consideredin conjunction with many cases which we havelooked into on behalf of SOE. It seems to usthat they are running fargreater risks by theiremployment of people like LOUBER and ROGER. Itold Cecil that we would make another approachto SOE and let him know the result.I had a long discussion with TAR and Victorand RSS. It seemed to me that the position wasatalogue Reference:KVI4/194eminently unsatisfactory. I could see that thepicking up of an agent here was a difficultmatter. If he were transmitting on ordinaryH.F. at fairly frequent intervals to a fixedstation on the continent in Abwehr procedurewe should probably get his signals. If hewere transmitting in our military procedureit was problematical whether we should get hissignals. If he were transmitting in VHF it wasalmost certain that we should not get him.I entirely accept this as being the positionbut ny complaint is that the problem ofdetecting illicit wireless from this countryhas never been submitted to a real body ofexperts, and that posibly had it been givencareful study by such a body at least thepresent dangers might have been to some extentmitigated. Victor agreed that it might bepossible to work on some automatic etherscanner which would increase the chances ofpicking up an agent. There might also beother possibilities, if the ground werethoroughly explored. So much for picking upthe call. The next stage is to D.F. theposition of the illicit transmitter. Recentexperiments had shown both in the case ofGARBO and in the case of an imaginery agentwho was located at Whaddon, that the bearingsfrom the fixed stations were 50-60 miles out.This being so, the margin of error on thecontinent would be considerably increased.We have alway s been given to understand thatfixed stations could give a fairly accuratebearing. The effect is that unless your vansget into the ground-wave they stand very littlechance of picking up the agent. The D.G. isCatalogue Reference:KVI4/194wrather anxious to take this matter up;bothTAR and I are opposed to any such course. Ipointed out to the DG that the Radio SecurityCommittee consisted of a Chairman who knewnothing about wireless, and that he and I hadno knowledge of the subject, and therefore wewould all be at the mercy of Gambier-Parry whocould cover us with megacycles. The discussionwould get us no where and only create badblood. He seemed to think however that weought to get some statement of the positionparticularly since I pointed out to him aflase impression was created by the notes ondiscussions by the FindlaterStewart Committee.The impression given is that if an agent weredropped we should probablypick him up withina reasonable time. The fact is that unlessthe aircraft tracks pin-pointed him andthe police and Home Guard did their job, weshould be extremely unlikely to get our man.Technical means would give us little if anyassistance. By the time a man had been locatedthe harm would have been done.May 28thGrassby telephonedthis morning to say that hehas received a policereport that a boat has beenfound on 27th May at Climping near Little-hampton.

Igather that the DMI is rather thinking on theselines and may as soon as he is firmly in thesaddle, make representations.lot of telephone calls are coming in from theFrench Naval Office but none of them seem tohave any bearing on future operations.May 29thI hear that the Germans have staged an armedparachute raid on lito's headquarters. Titohimself got away and SO did the SIS represen-tative, although he lost his wireless set andcyphers. Other officers were captured. ThisCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194lsmay be significant of what may happen here duririnvasion time. In this connection I gatherthat the J.I.S. paper has resulted in pre-cautions being taken at 21st Army Group H.Q. Q.The bogus Monty scheme appears to have beensuccessful. His arrival in Gib. has got toMadrid and has been wired through to Berlin.The whole thing was I believe very wellstaged in Gib. A Spaniard named Molinawas visiting the Governor at the time of"Monty*'s arrival. He was shut in a roomwaiting to see the Governor, from the windowof which he could see "Monty" and the governorwalking up and down on the terrace. The onlytrouble about the scheme is that it hasperhaps been placed a little too early.De Gaulle has said that he on't come here unleshe is allowed to communicate in his own cy phers.This raises the question as to whether heshould arrive before D.day or immediatelyafter. If he is allowed to remain in Algiershe will probably broadcast to the resistancemovements on lines which we might not considerto bevery appropriate. If on the other handhe comes here before D.day he may communi-cate information about the date and target incyphers which will probably be read by theGermans. The question is to be decided by theChiefs of Staff.The Russian Admiral KHARLAMOV and hir and Armyrepresentatives are to be taken on a cruiserto witness the Overlord assault. Ostensiblythey will be going to visit Rosy th. They willCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19446however be taken from there by car direct totheir ship. The question as to whetherKHARMALOV'S party should be allowed to witnessthe assault was discussed in the J.I.C. Itwas pointed out that no facilities of any sortwere beng given to Gen. Burrows in Moscow.He could not even visit the front. It wasthought however that this would not be a veryappropriate moment to bargain. If howeverdmiral KHARMALOV'S party wished to witnessfurther operations on the continent theywould be told that no facilities would begranted unless reciprocalltreatment was givento en.Burrows.John Senter came to see me about the Frenchagent Lt. ROSENTHAL who appeared to haveinformatkion about the target area. At ameeting at Claridges in the suite of Col.Stirling of the S.A.S. Regiment , at whichseveral other British officers were present,the uses of S.AS. troops had been discussed.At one point during the discussion ROSENTHALmade a semi-circle on a large-scale mapimmediately behind the target area. He saidthat he thought that S.A.S. troops couldbe effectively used at this point. Therewas some doubt as to whether he had put histhumb on that particular spot accidentallyor whether he had done it with knowledge.Thegeneral impression was however that he haddone it with a full knowledge of the targetarea. As a result of this incident Mockler-Eerryman and Senter visited Shaef on 26th or27th May and reported to facts to Col. Sheenand Gen.Betts. It was felt that it must beCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194u7assumed that Duke St. were aware of the targetarea and that in consequence no French agentsrun by SOE in conjunction with Duke St. shouldbe allowed to go into the field before D.day.I raised the question as to whether a similarinstruction had been issued by SHAEF to SISsince if the presumption about Duke St.wasCo rrect, any agents that they had ef a similartype should also be prevented from goinginto the field. Apparently this point hadnot been considered. With Senter's approvalL went over and saw C. to whom I explained thesituation. He said he would look into thematter and issue the necessary instructions.SOE are reporting the whole matter to SHAEF.A paper has come in from Norfolkt Housecalling a meeting tomorrow to discuss thepossibility of the diplomatic ban beingremoved on D.plus 1 or 2. The proposalis to notify Embassies and Legations that theban is being removed but to say that owing tothe general congestion it is likely thattelegrams may be held up for some time.In factinstructions will be issued to stop any tele-grams, bags or couriers going out untilD.plus 7. In the light of this decisionindlater Stewart thinks that we ought toreview all our security restrictions now.What disturbs me about the present proposal isthat the main issue has not been properlyunderstood. As soon as foreign govts. arenotified that the ban has been lifted, theinformation will reach the Germans via Madridand Stockholm and they will immediately concludethat the Overlord operation is the one and only.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/194The subsequent staggering of telegrams untilD plus 7 will in no way affect the German con-clusions unless it is intended to stop en clairtelegrams which are now authorised. I spoketo Peter Loxley. He said that SHAEF hadput up a paper urging that the ban should beretained until D plus 30 and the ForeignSecretary had put one up advising that itshould be removed on D plus.l. SubsequentlyEisenhower and Bedelk-Smith had seen theForeign Secretary and the compromise arrange-ment had been made. I pointed out to Loxleythat from the point of view of the cover planit was wholely unsatisfactory. He saidthat he, Cadogan and Eden were all away butthat he would speak to Eden in the morning.Meanwhile we have been thinking up some formof deception if we are faced with the removalof the ban on D plus 1. We shall have to tryand put it over to the Germans that this is adeliberate hoax. Tommy Harris has worked outquite an ingerinns scheme. I still feelhowever that once the removal of the ban isannounced in Madrid the Germans will tkaeappropriate action before the deception hashad time to work.I talked to C. about the removal of the ban.He said it would put all his deception schemefor a supposed attack on Bordeaux in the cart.May 30thTAR saw Williams at 21st ArmyGroup yesterdayand gave him my views about the removal of theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194diplomatic ban. I gather that Williams isputting up quite a strong note about it.At the D.G. 's meeting today we discussedCrossbow arrangements. The staff is to bedivided into 4, 30 people to go to theChancery Lane dug-out, others to Blenheim,others to different offices with which theyare associated, and the remainder on leave.At 11.30 we had a meeting on Overlord Securityat Norfolk House, when the removal of therestrictions in the light of the abohition ofthe ban on D plus 1 were considered. KennethStrong made quite a good speech in which hesaid that he thought he would be able to givethe meeting an appreciation of the situationby D plus 12 and that he would like all thepresent restrictions to remain on until thatdate. With one or two exceptions this wasthe general feeling of the meeting. I spoke toStrong afterwards about the removal of thediplomatic ban on D plus 1. He agreed thatit was extremely undesirable and said thatGen. Eisenhower had put in a strong noteof protest which he hoped would be effectiveIf not we should have to use the best decep-tion methods at our disposal.There was apparently a raid on one of our H. "Q. aat Porssmouth last night with a certain numberof casulaties. This may be due to informationwhich has been put forward by our agents, afterapproval by all the authorities concerned.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/192THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENTSIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTIC3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDMay 3lstACT 19582r1.o00ww At the weekly meeting today I asked what stepshad been taken to vet the 4,000 Frenchmen whohad come here with the French Armoured Divisiorsome. time ago.

Drew said thathe was quite certain that Findlater wouldenjoy the task. At the same time we could notexpect him to stick his neck out. There hadsome time back been the question of his actingas co-ordinator of the activities of SIS,SOE and ourselves. He had received a verypolite raspberry from Eden and Selborne. Theywere very ugrateful for the offer and shouldoccasion ever arise would make a all upon hisservices.On the 27th May Hitler when speaking to theJap Ambassador said that he himself thought thatafter having carried out diversionary opera-tions in orway,Denmark, the sourtern part of thewest coast of France, and the French Mediterran-ean coast, the allies would establish a bridge-head in Normandy and Brittany and after seeingbow things went would then embark onthe establishment of a real second front in thechannel. If this is the firm view of theGerman General Staff it is not altogetherdiscouraging since they evidently expeet thatour first effort will be a diversional one.They do however seem to think that the mainattack will be dependent to some extent on thesuccess or failure of the establishment of thebridgehead in Normandy or Britanny. This mighttherefore lead them to make an all out attackon the bridgehead at once. If however they thirthat the main attack is coming across theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194Junarrows, hey-should at reast maintain consid-erable reserves, and the firmer the -- establish-ment of the bridgehead the more inclined theyshould be to withhold these reserves.

His iriverowas similarly dealt with.The car then proceeded to the coast and a mess-age was left in it to the effect that theGenera had left for VAfric by submarine.In actual fact he was taken into the mountainsand kept there for about lodays until hecould be got away in an MTB. He certainlyhad a very unpleasant experience.He saysamongst other things that he groaned like adog on account of acute constipation andsuffered a complete stoppage for a week. Theonly food he had was an occasional chunk ofbread and cheese and drink of water whichwas got from the natives. However he waswell treated as soon/a they got him on tothe MTB and has been given all the honourg ofhis rank since that time.Michael Ryde tells me that he is not going backto .Africa.

Africa in order totidy things up. "e" had apparently said thathe saw no useful purpose in his going and SOhad Sir John Step enson. I was not convincedhowe er that they were expressing their opinionwith a full knowledge of the facts. Neitherof them has seen nyde. Ayde himself thinksthat in SO far as our liaison with Baston andLenton is concenred the matter might be arrangedby letter. As reg irds SiS relations with theUnion he thought this was a very complex matterand that his assistance would be valuable. Iraised the question as to whether informationrelating to Ossewa Brandweg was of any interestto HMG and whether we had any responsibilityfor obtain ng such information. If SO aliaison with -enton would give us somethingof a line. This of course would have to havethe concurrence of Smuts but should not beknown to Baston. Lenton has miking facilitiesand telephonefacilities which are not availableto the police and he runs the Censorship.He has records dating back for some yearswhich are of considerable value and could bedrawn upon. He is not allowed by Smuts tomake any enquiries but occasionally does So.It was decided that Ede should have another alkwith Sir John Stephenson and that Michael Rydeand ourtenay Young should discuss the wholecase with Vivian and Oliver, putting to themthe difficulties that their new representativein Lourenzo Marques might encounter in hisCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1946relations with the Union and asking them ifthey were quite sure that they did not wantRyde's assistance. Stephenson would be askedwhether he expected us to provide him withinformation about O.B. and whether he thought-it would be useful for us to be in touch withLenton. If he is in favour of this, we wouldapproach Gen. .Smuts.We discussed this matter amongst ourselvesafterwards, Courtenay Young being present.He said that there were considerable manifes-tations of the 0.B. in southern nhodesia. Hethought therefore th t it was a matter of someimportance that we should know which way thewind was blowing in .Africa. If the Unionwent out of the Commonwealth at a later datewe might find that the S.Afric ns were tryingto penetrate Rhodesia, rather in thae waythat the foreign organisation of the Nazi Partypenetrated German S.W. There would then be adistinct security problem in colonia territory.This was perhaps looking rather far ahead butit was certainly a problem that might arise.Dick did not feel that we could very Nell run asecret service in S.Africa. He thought thatwe we should rely upon our relations withBaston and hope that under a new regime theymight improve. I pointed out that if SISoperating from Lourenzo Marques had to conducttheir negotiations with the Union, Britishliaison with the S. African authorities ouldpass into the hands of SIS and out of our hands.This might not be altogether desirable.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19463Lennox tells me that the latest weather reportsare not particularly favourable. The finaldecision about the assault will be left until5 a.m. on D.day. +he bulldozers are to go infirst, followed by some light craft whichwill occupy the beaches. The main attack willnot go in until after midday, at low tide.De Gaulle is arriving tomorrow morningI have seen the Press directives which are tocome into force after the opening of the SecondFront. There is one para which invites acertain amount d speculation about attackselsewhere. I gather the P.M. is to throw outsome veiled hint of this in his speech. Thisstrikes me as being an extremely unwise move.I am convinced that it would be much better toleave the Germans guessing about attacks else-where. If they are hinted at by the F.M. andPress the natural inference will be thatthere are going to be no such attacks. L havenentioned this to TAR and suggested to himthat he should make the point with Wild atSHAEF.There is still no final decision about thediplomatic ban. the latest information isthat the P.M. has told Ike that he favours theForeign Secretary's view unless Ike feelsvery strongly that the ban should bemaintained.Meanwhile there has been a direetive about theban from the Canbinet which hs SO incomprehen-sible that Findlater Stewart has had to sendit back and ask precisely what it means.Ilunched sith Curry today.

There are 6 battle-ships in the channel dealing with targets onthe coast in addition to a great deal of othernaval craf't. One story is that a number ofsubmarines came up off the Calais coast, putup a heavy smoke-screen and started broadcastingthrough loudspeakers a series of battle-noisesfrom records, which immediately drew the bigguns on the coast to fire into the smoke-screen.Only one gun position was in action after0 o'clock. The Germans reported parachutelandings at Havre. This was a blind, and the"troops" were made of saw-dust, and explodedwhen touched. All the bridges had been beencaptured intact at the mouth of the rivernorth of Caen.TAR went up to Hendon early this morning toget a message over at 3 a.m. from Garbo to theeffect that one of his agents who had escapedfrom a marshalling area had reported that theCanadians hd embarked.

These loosesare however very slight in view of the immensenumber of ships that there are in the channel.Ginger Lewis says that the operation was acomplete surprise to the German Navy, who did notget going till quite late in the day. Hardlyany bombers have sofar put in an appearance.It is believed that there is a small number inthe area, which may attack thebridgehead but thatthe main base is in Germany. resumably theGermans are waiting until they have ascertainedprecisely what their target should be.

It was apparentlyhis intention to demolish the whole of thesouth 6f England. He did not intend to waittoo long for the invasion. If it did not comesoon he would start his rocket offensive andWithdraw troops for offensive action on theRussian front. There seems little doubt thatHitler is trying to put a good face on thingsfor the benefit of the Japs. According to him,the Russians have approximately 700 divisionsin the first line and 200 in the secondthough some of these are not up to strength.The quality of the infantry is said to beinferior but the artillery and tanks areexcellent. The quality of the nussian gunsis better owing to the large quantities of tung-stun,molybdenum and other metals used. TheT. T.34 34 tank is thought to be better than the Germansas it was more suitable to the topography andclimate of the battle area on the eastern front.Catalogue ReferENCe:KVI4/19472The German Tiger is too heavy and cannot beused in the mud season. The German assaultguns are likewise lacking in mobility.The new German tank, the Panther, is still inits seething troubles. The Germans hopeto produce their output of antitank gunsand tanks. The monthly output by Jan 1945is estimated at 1800 and 1500 respectively.e Tricycle-Ereak transmitter is still off theair.

This was readily given.Iexplained that bothaour action and the actionof the H.0. was in fact ultra vires since themembers of allied forces, once enrolled, ceasedto be subject to the Aliens Order. They couldleave the country provided they could obtainthe necessary transport. They could not enter,unless they came within the provisions of theAmendment to the Aliens Order by which we wereentitled to examine military personnel comingfrom abroad. I also mentioned the case ofthe Mexican military mission. It was agreedthat this should be a matter for the Chief'sof Staff. Findlaterstewart said that as heunderstood it the present decision with regardto the ban was that it would go off on Dplus 7 and that diplomatic missions herewould be notified to this effect on D plus 6.It would be open to Gen.

He said thatthe decision to attack was based on a guaranteefrom the met. experts that we should have 30hours of tolerable weather as from 9 O'clockon Monday evening. Their calculations workedoutcorrectly.Beteen 9pm and 12 midnightthe sky was absolutely clear, and 8o far theweather has held tolerably well.Nobody seems very clear as to where theAmericans are. This is due to the fact thatthey refused to have phantom units reportingback to Army Group. They said that such unitswould upset the normal channels of communi-cations. It was pointed out to them that theywould probably find themselves in difficultieswhich has indeed proved to be the case. Theyhave asked for air support but as nobody is quitclear where they are such support isdifficultto give. Eisenhower has now given orders thatphantom units are bo go in. These are to beBritish units and will go in tonight.For the 24 hours preceding the attack the GermarCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/19476did not send over a single recce plane to thiscountry. The view is that they had made uptheir minds that owing to the weather conditionsno attack would take place. The photographicunits have done a marvellous job. In factpractically all the information about theenemy's dispositions has been based on thephotographs they have taken. S.A.S. troopsve been given a large number of targetsin the Pas de Calais area.

Hewas rather pessimistic about the weather thismorning which is preventing our heavy bombersfrom operating with any degree of accuracy.We have been forced to use medium bombers whichhave suffered rather heavy casualties owing tothe lack of altitude in which they are forcedto attack.We had a meeting of Harry's security commiitteetoday at which Cussen and Tangye diselosedthat SHAEF had passed a report sent up by theEvening Standard war correspondent on the subjecof Mulberries. The report WIS to the effectthat everybody had been wondering how we couldhope to establish a bridgehead without capturinga port but that this difficulty had been over-come by the special landing -stages which hadbeen towed across the channel. It is amazing thithat a report of this kind shad have beenofficially passed by SHAEF censorship. Thewhole incident draws attention to the factthat there are two bodies carrying out censor-ship in this country, one the M.0.I. and twoStrF. This is clearly undesirable, and stepsare being taken to bring it to notice as soonas possible. This latest disclosure shouldlead to a more satisfactory arrangement.Personally L think that censorship should remainwith the M.U.I I. who have all the necessaryaardgnsReteferce:klf4ff94f of D.notices, etc. andthat SHAEF should have their officers attached.Certainly nothing should go out unless passedby M.O.I. The only contribution that SHAEFdo make is on the purely operational side.After this meeting we discussed the arrivalsof French personnel koxkbix in this country.It was agreed that Burn should get accurateinformation from Creen as to precisely what wasgoing on in N.Africa. We decided that inSO far as embodied personnel were concernedwe should probably have to rely upon the Frenchexxamiaationn. As regards Air Force personnelwho constitute a special danger, it was decidedto continue the present procedure by which allthose who had come out since the total occupa-tion of France should be submitted tonan LRCexamination. We would not however in futurelook up the names of the remainder. Otherallied personnel should be submitted to LRCinterrogationGarbo is continuing with his set-up aboutattack on another front. The Germans replyto hisiindighant message was extremely apolo-getic although they did not say preciselyway they were not listening at 3 a.m. They areevidently very worried at his being SO upstage.In passing on his message(they ultimatelyreceived it at 8. 30) they told Berlin that ithad only reached them at 9.30 owing to severepressure on the lines.I gather from Lennox that there is a possibilityof another landing, after the present beach-head gets sealed off. Thiggs are going quiteCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19432well although fighting in the Caen area is verysevere. The Bridgehead has been slightlyenlarged. The Germans are continuing to attackwith tanks but have not made any real impression1202 naval vessels took part in the intialoperation. Naval easualties have been almostnegligible.things in Italy are going extremely well andAlexander has been told to take risks if hewants to. the line on the Adriatic is begin-ning to move back and the Germans are obviouslyafraid of being encircled.A survey of German P/W opinion between Jan. and A]"pril 1944 shows that the morale of all ranksis high and remarkably little affected bypolitical misgivings. There is evidence of astrong desire to rally to the support of theregime and an increasing unwillingness tocontemplate the possibility of defeat. Germanopinion has returned to the position which itoccupied in the early spring of 1943. Apossibility of victory is generally thought todepend on the result of the invasion in WesternEnrope, and this is tied up in the beliefin the efficacy of German counter-measures.I regard to the regime,P/Ws showed a highproportion of men completely loyal to theNational Socialist system. In the period underreview 59% are described as completely loyal.Nimong 112 there were only 3 real anti-Nazis.P/Ws adopted a somewhat cooler attitude towardsHitler which generally however falls short ofdestructive criticism. Belief in the soundnessof the home front is as firm as ever, andCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194guGerman propaganda has apprently succeeded incontrolling the concern felt in regard to airraids.According to a report by Milmo dated 2.6.44the flow of agents to this country in thepast two years show a slight decline. It showsno evidence that the enemy are sending anyincreased number of agents here with assignmentsnnected with the invasion and there isa mention of invasion only in connection with3 of them.I understand that the German panzer divisionsoperating in the bridgehead ane lar from upto strength. Against a British division theyhave only about half of the normal complement.The Germans still seem to think that the Calais-Dunkirk area is likely to be the object ofour major attack, and are in consequence leavingtheir major reserves out of the line.Garbo's traffic should be helpful in this res-pect. The Jap in Vichy is still betting onthe Calais Dunkirk area and is presumablygetting his information from Laval and Abetz.The Brazilians are very cockahoop about havinggot the invasion date from their representa-tive in Ottawa 24 hours before the events actua 1took place. This was undoubtedly due to theindistection of SHAEF in allowing reports fromwar correspondents to go toe the various news-papers, to be held until after Eisenhower's firstcommunique. We know that such a report went toToronto and probably there were others.AnatalogyeoReferfofe:y4igsource refers toa possible amalgamation of the Abwehr and S.

This piece of deception mayhave been effective since there has been a bigconcentration of submarines,son 30, in theBay of Biscay. These are now moving up tothe bridgehead, one has been sunk and theothers chased off.June l0thKellar talked to me about the Mid East.There has been a certain amount of telegraphingbetween SIME, DMI, India, D. .I.B,I.P.I. .I.B, I.

The enemy say that his reports caneven decide the outcome of the war.utus.'s reports are being passed to Pariswith all possible despatch and we have made anarrangement with the Germans that a wirelesscontact can be made regularly 3 times a day.The Germans have suggested to Sniper that heshould try and get a letter out of the countryby contacting naval personnel. They shouldknow of course that anything of the kind isquite impossible.June l1thI saw Duff over the weekend at Tring. He wasvery interesting on the subject of de Gaulle.With a tremendous struggle he managed to fix upde Gaulle's visit with the necessary conditiontnat he would be allowed to communicate withAlgiers from here in his own eypher. De Gaullehowever did not show much appreciation of Duff'sefforts and merely said that he wondered whetherit was worth while his coming at all. Since hisarrival here efforts have been made to getsomething going in the nature of discussionsinvolving the recognition of the Committee andthe part it is to play in the future of France.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/1941No agreement in the question of Amercan partici-pation has been obtained. The President hasagreed to our having unilateral conversations.When this ground has been cleared de Gaulle willpresumably go to the USA. I doubt whetherhe will be a very good advocate against thewelter of prejudice which exists in the mindsof the President and numbers of those whoservehim, who probably include Admiral Leahy,t the for-mer American Ambassador at Vichy. Otherquestions that have caused trouble are Gen.Eisenhower's leaflet addressed to the Frenchwhich after some pressure was submitted to deGaulle for his approval. Certain comments andamendments were suggestedbut when receivedthe French were told that as millions of copieshad already been printed it would not be pos-sible to do anything. More trouble has beencaused by the notes printed in the USA whichare to be used by our and the American troopsin France. Firstly no arrangements appear tohave been made for any Govt.guarantee to backthese notes, secondly the French, who have beenasked to co-operate say that in issuing anyinstructions to the French people they want tosign in the name of the Comite. Everybodyjibbed at this as they thought it was tanta-mount to recognition of the Lomite. In actualfact all the French were doing was to ask forthe right to sign documents in what they under-stood to be their own name. The P.M. was rathershaken when he was told that the notes had nobacking. He pressed the button and said "Sendfor the Chancellor of the Exchequer". The replycame back that the Chancellor had left an hourago for his country seat. The P.M. said "Blasthis ey es, what does he mean by deserting hisCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19488post on a Friday afternoon". Eventually a mancalled Fraser arrived from the Treasury whoconfirmed the fact that the notes were notbacked and that they were in fact of an extremelyindifferent quality. Moreover the 5 fr.notelooked just like the 50,000 fr. note. the P.M.was ratherinclined to brush this aside, buton being shown the notes and having an eye forsomething that was well dane, was visibly dis-appointed at these cheap-looking notes whichwere of a kind which you would expect tobuy at Hamleys. The whole question is beingfurther considered. The P.M. seems to have threebad bees in his bonnet. Firstly de Gaulle,secondly Ireland, and thirdly the visitors ban.His good bee is the President, and anything thatis contrary to the latter's wishes is liable tobe swept aside.Duff has made it very clearto the P.M. that he regards de Gaulle as the3only person who entstanynice at alt in Franceand for that reason he should be supported.June 12thThe P.M. is proceeding to the beachhead today andd Gaulle has expressed a wish to go too. Duffthinks he ought to be allowed to go and ifhe is not given permission by Wednesday he willgo back to Algiers.Duff manages to get on with deGaulle whoapparently likes him. On the other hand thereis no doubt that de Gaulle is an extremely diffi-cult and dour personality.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/194oaAlexander has asked the P.M. for a free hand inpursuing the enemy in Italy. It seems that theGermans only have 6 divisions in reserve andthat there is a good opportunity of rounding upa large number. Things are evidently movingvery fast.A message received today indicates that theGermans are extremely pleased with Garbo. Theysay that the reports received in the Lastweek have ex confirmed almost without exceptioninformation from other sources and are to beregarded as of speial value. the main linein future for Garbo is to be the enemy groupof forces in eastern and southeastern England.They would also like to know in good time whenthe formations assembled in Scottish portsput to sea and what their destination is. Thisall shows that the cover plan is working welland that up to the present the Germans are con-vinced that the major offensive is coming else-where. Another message indicates that ZIGZAGmay be with us again before long, probablyaccompanied by a man named LEHAR. Von GROENING,ZIGZAG'S boss, was asked on the 7th June toascertain from the 9th Fliegerkorps whether ththe operation was possible.I attended a meeting at Norfolk House at 12today to discuss a new proposition with regard tothe diplomatic ban. edale-Smith lunched on Sat.with Eden as a result of which he sent Eden aletter stating that it was a mat'ter of operation-al necessity that the ban should be maintaineduntil the 15th June and that after the 26th Juneother restrictions could be taken off. Theataloger ReferenCe:KVI4/194Stewart committee considered on Sat.90whether it was possible to modify this demandin any way by allowing some of the allies orco-belligerent neutrals to have their communi-cations restored. They came to the conclusionthatthis was not possible since the informationwould undoubtedly get round, when the deceptionadvantage of the ban would immediately be lost.A paper is to be prepared fof Eden explainingthis point and for the Minister of Productiona somewhat different paper informing himin connection with tomorrow's Cabinet meetingthat the situation had changed and that newdemands a.re now being made. Murrie, of theNar Cabinet Offices, said that he had the P.M.'Scomments on the previous paper. It was clearthat he still had the viskor's ban very muchon his mind. He said that steps should be takento get rid of this obnoxious restriction at theearliest possible moment, and followed this byrecommending that this should be done quicklyand unobsrusively. He does not realise ofcourse that the ban involves penalties againstanyone found in the area who cannot properlyexplain his reasons for being there, and thatthe position was made clear to the public beforethe ban was put on. If the ban is to beremoved some announcement will have to bemade. This will imply a letting up of restrictioand will be just as harmful to the cover planas the remov al of the diplomatic b in. MurrieNas very concerned about the P.M. being properlyinformed before the Cabinet meeting,o otherwisehe might give some ruling which vould not con-form to realities from which it might beextremely difficult to get him to recede. Lsaid that as far as theSecurity Service wereCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194a1concerned the visitors ban had not the sameimportance as it had prior to Overlord. We hadexpected a umber of parachutes to be droppedin the area immediately before the operationor very soon after it and we wanted any spiesof this type to stand out. This would not havebeen possible if the whole area had been clut-tered up with trippers. Nothing had in facthappened. We could not therefore definitelysay that it would not happen in the future buwe did consider that the risk had been verymuch reduced. It seemed to all those presentthat those responsible for billetting the troopswere now the only people who should be actuallyconcerned. The most we ca hope for is thatthe Minister of Production will be able topersuade the Cabinet that a new situation hasbeen created and that the various points whicharise should be referred back to rindlaterStewart's committee for a detailed report.In reply to a letter 1 wrote to Eddie Grantasking whether he would be prepared to take ona job as liaison officer with the French on thecontinent if need arose, he has written me thefollowing:"Very many thanks for your letter receivedthis morning. Yes, of course L will go to FranceBut L beg you, if you possibly can, to send meas a GSOl.

WriteBox -"Well, the Times wrote back and said they wouldhave to show this to the Military Censors andunder the circumstances,did I "wish to varymy instructions?". In the wisdomoof mymiddle age, I did. It occurred to me that theCensors - and perhaps the D.G. mightn't thinkit funny. But all through life one of my chieffailings has been that, if I thought somethingfunny, I thought everyone else would think itfunny too. And quite often they haven't. Infact it's continually got me into trouble.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/194asand I,Dick/Brooke Booth, Bonnefousse, Paillole, BeaumontVaudreuil, Manuel and another French officer hadlunch together. The meeting was extremelyfriendly. The real purpose of it was thinkto persuade us that the French should now takea more active part in the examination ofpeople coming back from the beachheads. Pailloletold me privately that de Gaulle was extremelyintransigeant, and that if we were to makeany concession in that regard it might go So!way towards putting the scheme for cooperationwhch had been drawn up between Dick and Pailloleon its feet. We said th t we quite understoodtheir feelings in this matter. Our main diffi-culty in the past had been to prevent the LRCfrom being inundated by officials of alliedgovernments; if we allowed the French in weshould immediately get requests from the othersand the task would become impossible. We didhowever undertake to see if there was any wayout. The French pleaded that as France wasnow invaded a new situation had been createdwhich would give us an argument in dealing withother nationalities. There is I think somethingin this and I am quite convinced that we shouldrightly go a long way to meet the French.Moreover if we get large numbers of refugeesthey will undoubtedly be of considerable help.We also discussed the question of their so-called accredited agents. In dealing with SOEthey were always told that they had to producethe man's name and address and, a good deal abouthis antecedents if he was to be examinedat theLRC. This they said they were not always in aposition to do although they could vouchentirely for the man's bona fides. They didCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194e4note meet with similar difficulties when dealingwith SIP, who accepted their word and passed theman's name to us as an accredited agnet. Infact they said quite frankly that the bestscheme for them was to get an agent out by SOEand bring him in through SISAs regards those who are examined, they saidif they could be allowed a few minutes with aman they could persuade him to tell us thewhole story. It often happened that Frenchmenwere reticent because they preferred to telltheir story to their pwmpeople. We XXX there-fore stood to gain by allowing the French someaccess to a man before he was interrogated.There is probably something in this but as Ipointed out to the French, we all run XX agentsand some of them were highly successful. itwas therefore difficult to be confident abouta man's bona fides unless you actually sawhim and sifted his story. They readily agreedto this but said that they might have beenagreat help in establishing the truth in manycases. Quite probably this is true but thedisadvantages of having all the allies in theLRC would have outweighed the advantages, ofgetting a more satisfactory interrogation ofErenchmen. ick,Baxter and I are going todiscuss the whole question tomorrow.Manuel said that by some kistake the FrenchResistance Movements had received the wronginstructions. Inste d of being told to stayput for the time being, they were told to goall out. In the Toulouse area they appear tohave captured 300 Germans. They also claimCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1949splayedto have paxat a considerable part in preventingreserves from being brought up to the peninsula.V.V. rang me up to know if we could providehim with an officer with a fair knowledge ofEuropean polities. He is to help with the workthat Curry is doing and might eventually findhimself in Gen.West's Bureau in Germany. I saidthat we should he very pleased to help butthat it was impossible to say at the momentatwhat our commitments were,going to be. Weanticipated that Gen. West might make furthercalls on us. Vivian then went on to talk aboutthe building up of Curry's section. He realisesthat at the moment SIS had to rely very largelyon our records but evidantly he hoped toimprove this situation. I said I was wellaware of this but that if we were sitting downseriously to build up two organisations todeal with the communist movement we all oughtto be locked up in a lunatic asylum. Viv.said that the system before the war had workedquite well. I said that it might have done sobut it would be extremelyydifficult to justifya duplication of records without which the twosections could not possibly carry on theirwork. I said that i should be very pleased todiscuss this matter with him in detail as soonas he had free time.Curry came to see me. He showed me a copyof the memo he had written stating the positionin his section as he saw it and placing theresponsibility on those in authority. His3 main grievances are (1) that there is noproper organisation abroad for providing informa-calaogae Reference:KVi4/194 that the interception work,good aswvCO TUT O waod this document forthe time being, firstly on the grounds that itwill receive no consideration at this moment,and secondly that I should like if possible tomove some way towards an amalgamation schemebefore SIS start building up a huge organisationand trying to card 8 years of back material.Curry has agreed to keep his memo, but does ndnot think that its presentation ought to bedelayed too long.Since the occupation of Rome a large number ofprobably S.D. agents have either fallen intoour hands or given themselves u. These includea man called Armando PERRONI, an importantmember of the SD post-occupationa sabotage net-work. As a result of his information thepremises of the former German Embassy in Romewere raided and sabotage material, arms andW/T sets were found. PERRONI has also reportedthe location of other sabotage dumps and giventhe names of about 40 saboteurs. Many of theseare ISOS characters. Other valuable informationhas been given by the Rome police who had byunspecified means obtained documents fromKappler's office. These contained the namesof 60 saboteurs among whom were many identicalwith those denounced by PERRONI. The originaisof SD messages dealing with despateh of a groupof saboteurs to Belgrade in April, etc.ISOS discloses that 150 stay-behind agents wereleft in some and other areas near or south ofthe present front line. l6 of various categoriesCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1941W/T operators, Secret writers, and others, who arto recruit couriers and send them north throughthe lines, are mentioned are being in Some.Of these only 3 are SO far in our hands buttwo are key men who should with luck leadus directly to half a dozen others and indireetlyto many of the remainder. Outside Rome oneW/T man and his assistant are already behindour lines and another should be over run inthe near future. There are also 6 N/T menwaiting to be over run before making their waysouth and establishing themselves in townssuch as Naples, Catania, Bari etc.According to information from Section V.there is a German agent called Ivans working awireless transmitter on the Cherbourg Peninsula.June 13thI saw "C" last night. He said that we weregetting fairly near some of the Crossbow sitex.Meanwhile he has head that projectiles of somesort or another are being brought up.

The damage I under-stand is not very great, nothing more than onewould expect from a 2,000 lb bomb. I spoke to"cn whose information was that 21 in all hadlanded including one in Dorset and one in Wilts.The general impression is that the Germans arerushing things in view of the invasion and thatin fact the apparatus is not really passedits teething troubles. C. had had informatiothat pre-fabricated sites were being erected incertain places. His agent had also reportedthat the fusilages of the aircraft were beingbrought up. It will be interesting to seewhether we get any Stichling messages askingGarbo to report on where the aircraft haveIsded.M.S.S. generally shows that the enemy is ina fair state of confusion. There is a Degsmessage today indicating tha the officer ofthe SD who was responsible for the kidnappingof Mussolini is now in western France and recruit-ing some 100 men who have been speciallytrained in Zbv functions. Teresa Clay hasestablished that this same individual wasrecently applying for uniforms of the allies.it seems possible therefore that we ayexpectan armed parachute raid on one of our head-quarters. The matter is being considered bythe JIS thus srafternoonDick, ,Baxter and Idiscussed the question of theFrench being allowed to participate in some wayin our interrogations. Baxter is stronglyeraegutorererence!evirsassed upon him the90desirability for general political reasonsof meeting the French to some degree. Wethought that they might perhaps be allowed tohave a representative down at Shoreham. Thiswould not amount to very much since it seemsdoubtful whether we shall have very manyrefugees. If they had been coming in in anyquantities they would probably have arrivedalready. We also agreed that refugees whoarrived at other ports might be seen by theFrench at Battersea after we had dealt withthem. I think that this concession ought tosatisfy them.Page and Twin have been up here seeing TAn.about the possibility of using XX agents forgetting cribs. This is already workingaccidentally in the case of Treasure and Brutusbut it seems possible that we might engineersomething which might be useful to G C & CSon similar lines.The SOE French section under Col.Buckmasterhave a circuit operating near the north coastof Brittany. A study of this traffic receivedfrom this circuit appeared to Warden tosuggest the possibility of German controlThis impression was verified by the report ofan SOE officer who had been over in an aeroplanwhich was dropping stores to the organisation.This officer had had a conversation by means ofan S. phone with the head of the organisationreception committee. He reported on his returnthat the voice of the latter individual hadsounded extremely gutteral and that he spokeneither fluent French or English. This wasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194lsDdismissed by Buckmaster as probably due toatmospheric conditions. Two days ago asurprising message was received from the wirelesoperator of the circuit, thanking SOE for thestores which had recently been delivered andstating that unfortunateycertai of the agentshad. had to be shot but that others had provedmore willing to do what the Genans askedthem to. So blatant did this message appearthat at first it was thought to be somesort of hoax. Independent information wasreceived however to the effect that the wholecircuit had been under German control for someweeks. Tis circuit is dangerously near thepresent operation. A list of the nemes of thepeople concerned in it has been sent to theLRC.Brook Boothe, Uick, Tar, Hart, Milmo, Stone andI had a meeting to discuss our relations with0. O.SS S S. I said that in my view we were perfect-ly entitled to have direct relations withOSS and that on grounds of expedieney this shoulbe done. OSS were at any rate in part theequivalent of an allied 2eme bureau. Sincewe have relations with all the other alliedPpme bureaux SO much the more should wehave them with OSS in SO far as the discussionof our own material is concerned and in anymatters wheek primarily concern this office.In fact OSS are receiving copies of U20 reportsdirect from Milmo. The only case in doubt seemedto be the one which affected vetting. WhereOSS were integrated with SOE the vetting wasdone through SOE. +his seemed reasonable sinceSOE were equally affected by. the introductionof a dud. As regirds SIS the relations wereCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194somewhat different. Stone is going to look intothis and if it is eonsidered advisabte estab:lish a direct contact with OSS.

PELLEGRIN of Antibes who was recruitedby POUSSIN in the spring of 1942 ia Marseilkesthey cannot identify her, although they knowthe names of other people with whom sheclaims to have been associated: The Frenchhave no special plans for this woman and itseems desirable that she ahoula be got overhere and thoroughly interrogated. Meanwhilea tay-behind agent in Bay:eux has been arrestedon a denouncement by some other French citizen.He is to come here for interrogation.THISIS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT REIAWEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION(4) OF THE PUBLIC RECOROSCatalogue Reference:KYVA Qoc eod10At the weekly meeting Mrs. Spring said thatBrandes, who some time ago talked of sending aSwiss courier named PEDRO here as an agent,has now stated that PEDRO has returned from hismission to the U.K. with detailed answers toan Einzheer questionnaire, and that he will bereturning to the U.K. at the end of this wedat the request of the British. There is no oneSO far whom we can identify with PEDRO, whois probably notional. Brandes also talks ofrecruiting as an agent the assistant to theSwiss M.A, and is discussing setting up a wire-less agent in U.K. He talks also of trainingPEDRO in secret writing. If, as seems likely,all these projects are notional, Brandes'imagination is going to have to work overtime.On 7th June Abt. II in Paris asked Berlin toarrange for Unter-offizier Count SOLIKOV to besent to Lille, and also asked for supplies ofEnglish underclothing to be sent there. SOLIKOVis probably identical witha man of that name whowas here before the war and who has a certainnumber of traces. He may be going to be usedfor some sort of parachute landing here.Vesey said that SO far between 30 and 40 Frencrefugees had arrived at Shoreham, also a certainnumber of Italians. LRC interrogators had seenabout 20 of the French, and there seemed noreason whatever to suspeet them of subversiveactivities. They were l1 of the labourer type.Incidentally the Americans are very unpopularbecause they have stripped these people of alltheir personal belongings to keep as souvenirs.Catalogue Reference:kV/4/1903Wethered said that an SOE man from Bergen hadjust arrived back here with a Norwegian who isnow at the LRC. They have particulars of for-tifications in the Bergen area, and say thatthey are in contact with the men responsiblefor building them, who are working under aGerman professor of 60 who is an N.C.0. in theArmy. There are also other people there whoare democrats and are prepared to work withthe British against the Nazis. So far thisstory has not been checked, but if it is truethere may be some useful work to be done.Marriott said that Gargo has been asked to findthe headquarters of General Bradley and AirMarshall Cunningham.I attended a meeting of the Findlater StewartForeign Office committee. The ban is definitelyto come off at minight on Monday I9th June.The Diplomatic Corps will be notified on thefollowing day and the allied governments onMonday morning. We have eased up to a consider-able degree on the entry and exit of ministerswho pending the removal of the ban will beregarded as special cases. I spoke to Find-later after the meeting. He asked me todine with him next week.Dick,Kellar Dick and L had a meeting with Vickeryand Bamford. We discussed Mid Eastrraffairs onthe basis of the telegram sent, by Maunsell toDMI India, mentioning future relations betweenM.I.5/6 and suggesting that any conferencebetween D.I.B and C.I.C.I. might be somewhatpremature. The fact is th t all D. .I.B. wantCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194loyto do is to settle their future sphere ofinterest with S.i.S. Several years ago theydivided Persia into two headings, D.I.B. takingresponsibility for the eastern portion andleaving the rest to S.I.S. These zones haveto some extent been modified to conform to theIndian and Middle Eastern Commands. D.I.B.I think wants to go back to the old arrangementwhich gives him rather more territory than heat present covers. It seemed to us that anynegotations on this subject were no affair ofours and that a settlement could be reachedon this somewhat important matter without inany way affecting the future relations betweenA.I.5/6. We were all more or less agreed thatthere was a good deal to be said for regardingLurkey,Persia,Palestine, Fraq and Egypt asone unit. The normal division between 5 and 6would be Egypt and Palestine under 5 and PersiaIrag and Turkey under 6. SIME of course hasmore or less co-ordinated activities withinthese areas although ISLD is still an independenorganisation. If SIME is disbanded there willbe no local co-ordinating body. This would bea pity. Should 5 and 6 get together in theMid East it would clearly be desirable forunem to have the closest possible relations with.I.B.We then discusssed the desirability of sendinganother representative to IB on the assump-tionthat we might stand to get more from thatquarter if we had our own representative. Theconclusion reached was that we could get allwe wanted through IPI here,but that it might bedesirable to have someone with D I.B who wouldCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194be based on our station in Ceylon.We shallbe looking into this.Lastly Bamlford said that there was at presentin India a Planning commission which would beconcerned with the re-oceupation of Singaporeand Malaya. It seemed to us that any repre-sentative that we might nominate for Singaporeafter the war might usefully join this tommissioand make a study of the files in D.I.B whichmight affect his area. We shall be discussingthis point with Ede.June 15thThere were 513,000 troops L nded in France bythe night of the 13th/14th June.On the llth June Steengra acht, intaking totheJap,said that the German military authoritieshad kadt at first been anxious lest theBritish, having failed in their first objectiveshould break off the operations and switchthe attack to another area. Since then theBritish had pontinueddto bring up reinforce-ments and in view of the forces employedto date it was thought it would not be e syfor them to make a change. There were noreports of landings in other places but suchandings were of course possible and the nec-essary preeautions were being taken. Germany'plan to allow us to land as may forces as pos-sible and then concentrate all the armouredunits in the bridgehead, bringing up therequisite forces should be completed by thellth, when the counter-attack would take place.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/194Steengracht explained however that it was afact that our bombing in the German rear wasvery severe and was making the movement of theGerman Armies difficult. What was worryingthe Germans was bey ond doubt the superiorityof our Air Forces and the guns of our war-ships. The Germans held the view that asregards quality the British troops were betterthan the Americans.I dined with the DMI and JC last night. TheDuI was very complimentary about the work ofthis office both as regards deception andsecurity. He was intending to write a letterto the D.G. expressing his gratitude for allthat has been done. He said that he had givenit as his opinion that it would not be possibleto deceive the enemy as to our real intentionsfor more than 4-6 days and that quite possiblyit would not be possible to deceive him at all.Hethought therefore that an immense successhad been scored through the tactical surpriseswhich had held So long and indeed was stillholding, lthough perhaps to a slightly Lesserdegree. He said that the JIS were writing aweekly paper on this particular point andhe thought that we ought to be consultedsince the Jrs might not be aware of thedegree of confidence placed by Himmler andthe Abwehr in Garbo's theory of a two-prongedattack. t mentioned the Jap Due. quoted aboveand said that at any rate on the llth the Ger-mans were still in some doubt, and were clearlyre-insuringmalthough perhaps to a lesser degreeThey have ssO far had 4 Panzer divisions inaction and others were coming up. One had foreataagie been nerereerhH4nfgy from Antwerp. I1o7gathered that there are only 8 in the whole ofthe western theatre and that some of theseare not very Nell equipped or up to strength.Everyone seems very pleased with the general-progress of he operation so far.We discussed with DMI the question of ServiceIntelligence generally. He seemed to thinkthat there was something in the idea of apermanent civilian staff. although he wasnot entirely clear as to what theirstatus wouldbe. He thought that they as experts mightfind it extremely irritating to work undercolonels who were constantly coming and goingand that it might therefore be difficult toget good people. The only possible methodof running it would be to put Inteliigenceon a higher plane than it is at presnet. Hedid not seem to think that the difficultieswere insuperable or that there would be anyreal difficulty to the promotion of thesestaffs round the Services including SI- andourselves.142 divisions should be landed in Franceby tonight.I saw Eddie Grant. He said he would be quiteprepared to accept the regional job withthe French subjeet to us being passed medicallyfit. L expl ined to him that the seheme washeld up at the moment owing to the difficultieswith de Gaulle.L dined with Joe Lynch.Catalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/194June LbthThere appear to have been a good many Crossbowincidents last night. It is reported that therwere 120 in the London area. I gahter th tthe nearest one to me was in Regents fark.The weather was apparently suitable with aGood deal of low cloud. The alert soundedat ll o'clock and continued until 9.30his morning. A further alert occurred about10 o'clock, which lasted till 11.3 30. TheHome Secretary has now made an announcementto the Press to the effect that thesemissiles are radio-controlled aircraft.Harry AIlan held a meeting today on therelaxation of security restrictions. Thereis to be a meeting this aftern on about theway in which the diplomatic ban should betaken off. I gather that the present arrange-ment is that the allies are to be told onMonday morning and the neutrals on Tuesdaymorning, the ban coming off actually at mid-night on Monday. It seems desirable thatpublicity of any kind should if possible beavoided. We should at least give thempression that Ne are not giving unduepublicity to the ban. It Nill of course be putultimately on a foreign date line, since thevarious capitals in Europe have been notified.The visitors ban is apparently to come off atthe end of the month and alsoother restrictionwhichare automatically bound up with thediplomatic ban. I said tnat the visitors banonce removed, diplomats would be sure to gointo the area. It might be for considerationCatalogue ReferENCe:KVI4/194whether an attempt should be made to stopthem moving into the area even after the banhas been removed. He would not presumablystop journalists and it might therefore beargued that there was therefore no particularpoint in try ing to stop the diplomats.June 17thFurther details have been ascertainedabout Crossbow. The aireraft is 25 ft longand 20 ft broad. The speed is S id to be about3-350 mph. The aircraft is not radio-controlleits range being determined by the anount offuel used. It travels normally at about3,000 ft and carries about 2,000 kilos ofexplosive. 75 crossed the Co st Last night,of which 40 reached the London area: 7exploded in Croydon. The Germans are alreadyasking us questions about Crossbow arrivals.At present we are hedging by saying that itis verydifficult to get any information of adetailed kind. Casualties and killed So farare about 100 and 800 seriously injured. Theseare considered slight as compared withnormal air raids. SHAEF have given instruc-tions to the Air Force to bomb the Crossbowsites in So far as this does not interferewith any calls from the Second Front.The battle appears to be going well TheAmericans have pushed quite a' long way acrossthe peninsula. The Germans have to divisionson the northern end but no panzers. Theyhave already begun to demolish Cherbourgharbour and have sunk a ship of 12,000 tonsCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194right across the mouth. On the American fronttere are only one Fanzer division in operationwhile there are 4 or 5 operating against theBriti h sector. The line has fluctuateda little here and there but no appreciablegain has been made on either side. Meanwhilethe mulberries are 50%% completed, and troopsare still puuring across. The Germans havestill got one Panzer division in the vicinityf Brussels and another in the Bordeaux area, Wwhich is moving up very slowly, and anotheron the south coast. This appears to be allthe armour they have in the west.I attended a meeting at Norfolk House lastevening to discuss taking off the diplomaticban. The plan prevrouslyaarrangednwas generallyagreed. I raised the question of publicity.I felt that there was perhaps a certainadvantage in not giving the matter publicityand letting it leak out under a foreign dateline. Marshall who was present from SHAEFagreed that such a course might possiblyhelp the cover plan. I also pointed outthat instructions not orly to British but alsoto the American press would be necessary ifanything of the kind was contemplated. Itwas generally agreed that the removal of thediplomatic ban wauldcnot affect the presentinstructions regarding prohibited movementsof diplomats and service attaches into thebanned area.Nerbert raised the question of Crossbow. Itwas agreed that the previous arrangement shouldstand by which diplomats should be asked notto Catalogue refer Reference.kV/4/194 to fereocebavi4ng4hei Crossbow their telegrams. Thisshould include all allies as well as neutrals.There is also apparently an arrangement toprevent leakage of information in the eventof Big Ben (the rocket) coming into operation.There was a suggestion that telegrams shouldbe held up for 48 hours not in order to concealthe places where the projectile had landed butfor the somewhat obscure reason that the AirMinistry would have 48 hours during which toprepare counter-measures. Person 1ly I ean-not see what use this scheme can possiblyhave.I took the 12 o'clock meeting today. TheFrenchwoman Madeleine BERNARD is on her wayhere, also the Frenchman who was arrestedin Bayeux, calledAGUcHER. The latter's capturewas the result of a rather smart piece of workby the FSP. GY LCHE was denounced and had hispremises searched. A small piece of paper wasfound with a plan of theorchard and certainmarkings. This led the FSP to a particular trewhere on digging in the ground they found awireless set.We have written to the French giving thempermission to interrogate refugees after ourown interrogation has been completed both atShoreham and and at Battersea.Cordeaux of S.I S. rang me up to say that owingto some mistake permission had been given toQQEDHART to leave Gib. and that he might there-fore bearriving tomorrow morning. SIS realisedthat this was contrary to the arrangement andhave telegraphed their representative accord-Catalogue RefeReNCe:KV/4/194A?ingly. it might be therefore that GOEDHARTwould be stopped. I have informed D.l whohad already made arrangements for GOEDHART tobe taken straight to Gerbrandi's cottage.It will however be necessary to warn Gerbrandi.At 5.45 L tried to get on to Desmond Morton,Nevile Bland and A.D.E. but as they had allleft I made arrangements ith D. 4 to let usknow as soon as the man arrived at the airporttomorrow.Orr has a story that the French are trying tobuy up green fl notes for which they are payingan extra 1/6. They say that these can be soldin France for 25/- or 26/-. it is difficult toknow exactly what the game is. L told Orrto have a talk with Ned Reid.I saw Peter Loxley last night and asked himabout our getting the Cabinet papers relatingto Palestine. He said that there was aspecial Cabinet Committee which dealt withthis matter. He thought Dick Law was theF.O. representative. He felt however that weought reallyto apply through the C.0. Hegreed that it was important that we shouldsee all papers.Later in the evening I received a call fromColledge at Oxford to the effect that GOEDHARThad infact arrived this morning and hadaccording to instructions been taken to GERBRAN-DI'S cottage. The FSP officer who hadconducted him had gone on to London to delivera bag which GOEDHART had brought with him.June l8thcatasgeedseferere&:kifa/ig4 Norfolk House at which13Wild, B.1A and Charles Cholmondley were presentThe meeting was anxious to get some sort ofdirection from the Air Ministry as to howquestions about Erossbow could be answered.Was it desirable to play up the efficiencyof Crossbow of run it down? Should we attemptto mislead the enemy as to where the prokectilewere falling? If so, in what direction? Howfar would anything that we said be affectedby the lifting of the diplomatic ban?There seemed to be very little answer to thesequestions on the information available.Ileft the meeting after 10 minutes and proceededto another called by the J.I.C. which wasprimarily concerned with "Big Ben". Photogra-phic reconnaissance showed that at Wattenthe site was clear of stores and contractors'plant on June 14th and on June 15th parts ofthe site had been camouflaged and increasedstores and packings were observed under cam-ouflage at the stores dump. This site appearedto be externally complete. The other sitesWizerne, Siracourtand Mimoyecqu were in vary-ing stages of completion. The general con-clusion to be drawn was that Watten almost cer-tainly and Wizerne possibly had reached astage where civil construction was completeand military construction was in progress.The other two sites sere slightly lessadvanced. this assessment of the positionmade it advisable to attach rather moreimportance to a report received from an agentof C's on the l6th June in which it was statedthat Watten would be operating in the nearfuture. There was a word in this connectionwhich might imply today,June 18th, but onCatalogue Reference:KV/4/194further examination and without a check it wasimpossible to say anything definite. Itseemed therefore a wise precaution to attackWatten at the first opportunity and the other3 sites in the near future. Arrangementshave in fact been made for this to be donewith 12,000 1b bombs which penetrate concreteto a depth of 12 ft. and are likely to doconsiderable damage if they fall even in thevicinity. It was agreed that these mattersshould be brought to the notice of the Chiefsof Staff."Big Ben" is apparently 38 ft.long and carries5 tons of explosive. Nobody knows its degreeof accuracy, but on general form it is notconsidered likely that it will go more thanwithin a few miles of its intended target.I asked the meeting for some guidance on theanswering of questions which we had receivedfrom the enemy about the effectiveness ofCrossbow. Were we to try and mislead themabout location and effectiveness, and whatwere the chances of our being found out. AirCommodore Grierson who attended with A.C.A.S.I Iand appeered to be the expert on Crossbow,stated th t as far as Was known the pilotlessaircraft carried some form of wirelessapparatus which would approximately indicateto the Germans their course and place oflanding. From the point of view of the agenttherefore it was important that if he didreport he should report accurately. Equallyit seemed that there was no particular pointin extending the diplomatic ban since anyreports made by diplomats would only be tellingCatalogue Reference:KVI4/194the enemy what he already knew. D.N.I. thenasked for some general information aboutrossbow. Air Commodore Grierson said thatout of 225 of the aircraft which had leftthe sites in the first attack only 120 hadreached the London area. In the second attack144 had started and 110 had reached thearea and in the 3rd attack 138 had started andonly 78 had reached the area. This meansthat roughly three-fifths actually reachthe target area. The speed of the aircraftis estimated at about 250 mph while gainingheight and probably about 330 when on thelevel. Spitfire 9's can and have got rightup to them and alongside. They can explodethem with cannon at a range of about 2-300 yds.with a fair margin of safety. The explosionmay have the effect of putting the Spitfireinto a backloop. It is not likely to do itmuch harm. So far however neither the balloonbarrage,A. A. guns nor fighter attack have beenparticularly effective. Last night 5 were saidto have been brought down by aircraft and 2 or3by A. A. There are at the moment about 69sites from which these aircraft are probablybeing launched. Few of these are in theCherbourg Peninsula The majority are inthe Fas de Calais. Our planes were out onreconnaissance y'day but got no indicationas to where the projectiles were coming from.This was mainly dee to bad visibility. todaythe visibility has improved and better resultsare hoped for. As regards counter-measuresthe meeting of the war Cabinet at whichTedder was present considered what could bedone. Tedder said that these would dependCatalogue Reference.KVt4/194entirely, on visibility and operational neces-1Ibcesities. He would devote as much time tothe ski-sites as was possible, but could giveno guarantee as there were SO many uncertainfactors. Pin-point bombing is not easy andan immense amount of aircraft and bombs areemployed to make a real impression. The sitesare said to be capable of launching 2 aircraftper hour. There is no positive information ab-out the supplies of aircraft although there arerumours that some of the supplies are incaves near Rheims and Paris. It is felttherefore that for the moment bombinh by pilot-less aircraft must be expected to continuemore or less on the present scale. The enemyis more likely to operate in cloudy weatherthan in fine, when it is easier to locatethesites from which they are discharged. Mostof the aircraft last night came down southof the river, one fell in the ayswater road,and this morning about 11.15 one came overQueen Anne's Manslions and went right into theGuards Chapel at Wellington Barracks. It isfeared there may be considerable loss of life.I actually saw the damage a few moments afterthe bomb fell. It seems to be about theequivalent of a thousand pound bomb which1S in fact the weight of the explosive.We reported the facts of the meeting to Drewfor the information of Findlater Stewart, andalso to Dick Butler in the country for theD.G. S information. The D.G. had apparentlybeen contemplating coming up. I said I didnot thi k there was the slightest necessity.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/194
