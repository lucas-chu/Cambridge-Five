Things were now diiferent sincethe Staff was forced to take orders fromthe Party. A whole campaign in Africahad been nothing buta political saerificeand was hopeless from the start. MostGermans realised that the Party and itsactions had brought Germany into extremedisfavour with the rest of the world.As the result of this ho vever every Germaneven if he disagrees with Nazism, willfight to the bitter end in order to savehis ONn skin. This attitude is spurredon Ly mistaen British propaganda to theeffectthat a11 Germans up to the age of 16should be sterilised.Von Toma has been impressed by the ualityof the ordinary British soidier, thequantity and uality of the food suppliedto British troops and civilians, whichis infinitely superior to that in Germany,and by the wonderful way he has been treateCatalogue Reference:KVI4/19112as a German and an enemy. Von Toma criti-cises Rommel for his tactics at EL AlameinHe thinks that he should have eithercleared up the situation at once or elsewithara n right at the beginning. Hisdetermination to stay where he was was theresult of a direct order from the fuhrer."Those damned orders of the uhrer werethe cause of much misfortune for us inRussia" he said. Rommel was loud inhis complaints of the hir Arm under Kesssring. They wasted petrol owing to thefact that there was no proper co-operationbet een the U.A.F. and the Army. Bothvon Toma and Kreubel agreed that rommelbest quality is his experience as aninfantry man. They think him a bad t.inC. He understands nothing about artillery.They both object that they couldnot getdefinite orders from Rommel although thelatter meddled in everything. The factthat the buhrer mde himself C. in C. ofthe Army is regarded as unsound policy.It was humiliating for the army, for theyno longer had any representation. Nowfinally the order had come throughthat all Generals were to be examinedspecially to make sure that their ide swere firmniy based on National-Soeialistdoctrine. That was to be the decisivefactor. It seems that Mussolini neverwanted to advance beyond the Libyanfrontier but Rommel would not listen tohim.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/1913Von Toma has a poor opinion of the Abwehr.He is prejudiced by certain pessimisticremarks at the beginning Of war attributedto Canaris. These remarks vere:ueportedthrough the dentist of Frau Canaris. Itseems that Canaris sends his reports towhat is known as the Foreign Armies Dept.of of.the General Staff. They are here inte-grated with other intelligence.In discussin their experiences von Tomaand Kreubel remarked th that in Novembernommel promised tha't he would not startan offensive ag in until he had sufficientsupplies to ge to Cairo. It seems thatMussolini had made elaborate prep eparationsfor a triumphal entry and the bribery ofthe Egyptians. There is no doubt that theGeneral Staff reg rded the attack on hussiaas a gross blunder. Von Toma say s thatthe first time Guderian heard about theattack on Russia he said "What, anothercolossal blunder?n He thereupon issued anorder of the day telling his troops thatthey were going into the bloodiest battle,the longest road, the German soldier hadever had to face.Mrs. Rainbow's brother is in a P/W camp inGermany, andin the course of the past fort-night he has written no less than 4 timesto his sister requesting the desptach offood and clothing.

Hissuggestion about a committee to discussthe intelligence content of ISOS has goneforward to the D.M.I.There has b en a certain amount of li Ihearted discussion among B.Brancr officersas to the usefulness of Secret Service.Itis argued that since t e majority ofagents are unreliable or at le st thevalue of their information is difficultto assess, the reports they submit moreor less cancel each other out. In anycase few people have the courage to ict onthem. If they do they are just as likelyto be wrong is right. Therefore no valuein espionage and hence no point in counter-espionage. If we allo ed all the Germa nspies here to do their worst theirreportsmight e so conflicting as to totallymislead the German General Staff.Many of their reports are in fact mereinvention. The fact is that the onlytolerably certain basis for action is the iintercept and even that may at times bemisleading. Outside these sources I donot think ve get a great deal th that at is ofvalue and most of the work of Section V.is concenred with tying up the tag endsof ISOS.

He did not seemto think it necessary or desirableto employ agents for the purpose ofimproving our knowledge about the enemyalien population in this country. Hethought that the 5th column aspect wasrather out of date. Both Curry and Iwere in disagreement with this view.Obviously nothing is going to be done.It has been decided to send Dick to theMid East.

He said hewas glad to know about this since hewould see that the F.O. kept quiet.There was always a possibility that somebo-body unacquainted with what was goingon might summon the Ambassador to London.This would mean a return oi the staffand possibly the despatch of telegrams.I had a talk with C. about the n.S.S.Committee. I explained to him how theincident of 7/23 had arisen and that thecommittee had no intention of criticisinghis policy. All they wanted to do was tobring to his notice certain facts ofwhich he appeared to be unaware. He en-tirely accepted this explanation and toldme that as a result of our delib erationsa whole number of facts had been broughtto his notice for which he was verygrateful. I then outlined to himproposals for the formation of two com-mittees, one to deal with, priorities andthe intelligence content of ISOS, and theother, perhaps on a higher level, todeal with the allocation of R.S.S.resources.

Inthe main we believe it to be true althougwe think that he is trying to cover upcertain of his disclosures to the Germnanswhich he probably made under duress.He also appears to have been a littleover-sanguine about the Germans trustin him after he was released. This ledhim to make contact with various Polesconnected with theireseape organisationand it may well be that they have beencompromised.

Themeeting were asked to say whether theyconsidered the book to have operationa]significance, whether it should be broughtup to date, whether its present form wassatisfactory, whether it should appearmore frequently. The meeting agreedthat the book should be brought up todate and that ad hoc papers should beprepared on any matters which appeared tobe of oper itional significance. D.M.I.said that the preparation of these paperswould be of considerable value if therecould be some kind of meeting betweenthe users and producers of the basicintercept material in order that closelyrelated services such as M.S.S., Ingotsetc. should also be discussed where theyimpinged upon ISOS and ISK. I said therewas already in being a committee ofusers and producers which discussedpriorities and that if the Services wereco-opted as I thought they should be, sucha committee might well discuss the busineswhich D.M.I. had in mind.

Saw Thurston and myself. Thurstonhas made it very clear that the F.B.I.will not resume relations with Stephensonand in fact. that liaison with anybody inNew York is likely to be entirely mean-ingless.December 23rdCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19>December 23rdWe had another meeting at Kinnaird Houseabout America. No real decision wasreached except that we were for the timebeing to continue to regard Stephensonas our representative in New York. C. didnot think he could take any action untilhe had a report from Mr. Winant or hadthe opportunity of a personal inter-view with Stephenson.At the Wednesay meeting I raised thequestion of allied pilots coming throughthe L.R.C. I was anxious to know whetherall these pilots were accounted for in areasonable way Younger said he wouldmake enguiries in order to find outwhether any of them had subsequently beenreported missing in circumstances whichwere thought peculiar.The Lisbon leakage was discussed. Itinvolved information about our convoyswhich is said to be coming from theBritish Consulate and Embassy.T Thenumber of ships and the approximate daveof sailing are accurate but the escortand route are nearly always wrong.Hart mentioned a rather important Swisscase centred round.a a man called BUNSSEN.There seems to be a smally group with acommercial background operating betweenW.

It was pointed out that asaction had invariably to be taken onISOS material if a ship was in jeopardyit would be valuable to have agents insuch places as Seville and Huelva whoNould give the necessary cover to ISOSand ISK sources. S. I S. undertook tosee what they could do.I had a talk With Viv about Section Vand America. He is quite clear tha theirwork must go on but that in some way itshould be detached from D.S.C.

Quiteobviously Briscoe must see it if he isto carry out his duties.

The Admiraltyproposed to hold a special nguiry. Esaid that if there was ything thatCol.

It seems to have become knownthat the possibility of such an operationbeingt necessaryvwas at least envisaged.I lunched with Dick Casey. He is goingto Washington and will be back in Cairoon the 15th Jan. He seemed pretty tired.He told me that he had hada difficulttime during the first 3 months, but thatthings were now settling down. He didCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191not say so, but I gather that he did notfind Lampson a very easy customer. Heseemed pleased with the Intelligence set-upunder Maunsell, although he seemed to havea somewhat erroneous impression of theactivities of enemy agents in his area.Edid not entirely disillusion him as I didnot wish to let Maunsell donn. This goesto show however how necessary it is forDick to go out to the M.E. E. Casey wasobviously puzzled about the D.G.'sremark that Maunsell was responsible tothe military. Casey says that as the headof S.I.M.E. he is responsible to M.E.I.C.who is responsibl to the Defence Committeeat the head of which is himself. Iexplained to him Maunsell's position vis-a-vis the military and his responsibilitiesto the D.M.I.,M.E. In my view the wholesituation is unsatisfactory. Quite clearlyMaunsell is anxious to be based on theSecurity Service. I told Casey that Dickwas going out and he promised tosee himand give him all the assistance he required.Casey has regular meetings with Maunsell,S.I.S. and S.0.E. and seemed to be verysatisfied with their work.December 20thI had a discussion with Gibbs and Dix onon West Africa. It was decided to drafta wire to Swinton explaining to him thatStone was going to Freetown at any ratefor a period and that Mark Jonnstone wouldbe No. 2 to Dixon.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19143In the absence of Dick L took the 12o'clock meeting.

Whilesubjected to this treatment it can bephotographed We do not yet know thenature of the ink. The interest of thecase lies in the fact that MENEZES is anS.D. agent operating on British terri-tory. This is contrary to normal proce-dure. Although his information is of lowgrade, he is undoubtedly in 3 positionto do us considerabl harm. If we wonthe Ambassador he may ell decide to sendMENELES home. On the other hand if ne cou]be induced to remove nis diplomaticprevilege we could propably try him underthe Treachery Act, but to do this it wouldbe necessary to produce a copy of the lettewhich may cast suspicion on ouractivities. If we Cain get a really goodpiece of information the F.O. will considermaking the approach to the Ambass odor.I had a discussion vith Kenneth andRamsbotham about Americi. Ramsbothamis I think a little hurt about the introduc-tion of Gibbs, who the D.G. wishes tokeep a record of what information isreceived from Thurston and the informationgoing to him. The main idea is to seecommunications from the F.B.I. properlyfollowed up.

I said fe wordson the security aspect and also on the jobsthat might be open to those attending thecourse. Dick lectured extremely well.He coveredthw whole evolution of the fficesince the beginning of the war and thenexplained in some detail the basic sourceson which we work. After the lecture themeeting was thrown open to questions andgener l discussion.Cecil established touah with a man calledPeter Corcoran, who was formerly employedby the Garda. This man is now employed in aGovt. office over here. He had had passingthrough his hands certain reports aboutour military dispositions in N.Ireland.This ne had obtained in the Ministry ofDefence. While we do not mind Han havingthis information apart from the generalimpropriey of the action, we are ratherworried about its passing through a numberof different offices in Eire. There isvery little to be done about it. If at alater date we have any trouble with theMinistry of Defence we can give them a hintthat we know what has been going on inN.Ireland.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/191uyJanuary 5thA.D.N.I. came to see me about the Kamerad-schaftsdienst. He said that Robertson-MacDonald had been given authority to visitBarnet in order that he might acquaint him-self with the progress being made. In hisopinion very little was being done andOLEARY was getting practically no assist nceI said that this rather astonished mesince Ryle, who was in charge of affairs,was energetic and extremely intelligent.I thought therefore that A.D.N.I. beforetaking the matter further would be wise tohave a talk with Ryle.I had a meeting with Charles and Dick aboutMaunsell's position in the Middle East.At the moment he is responsible for his staffand finances to the D.M.I.

Maunsell feels thelack of any authority at home to whom hecan look for support and finance. tie woulmuch prefer to regard himself as an outpostof M.I.5. locally responsible to the DefenceCommittee for the work he performs. Hisposition wouid insansense be analagous tothat of Medlam or the D.S.O.Malta. We after-wards san the D.G. who authori'sed Dick tolook into the matter while he was in Cairo,Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19149T.A.n. and J.C. came to see me about theWALENTI case. They think that before pro-ceeding the N.Board should be consulted asto whether we could co-operate with the Poleson a case of this kind.Loxley rang me up about 5 Polish agentswho have been condemned to death. He wantedto know whether we had anybody we couldpossibly exen nge. 1 said that apart fromthe principle involved whicn ould be amatter of serious discussion, I did notthink we had anybody who would not be ableto give away a good deal of information ifhe were sent back to Germany.January 6thI took the Wednesday meeting. There havebeen further reports about the movements ofour convoys whiah are saidto be due to aleakage from the British Embassy or Legationin Lisbon.Canaris has had conversations with Wigonand Jordana. Migon has made it clear thatit is not possible for Spain to enter the waron either side. He did not believe thatthe allies intended to att ck Spain orSpanish Morocco. He pointed out however thatan attae k on Spanish territory would berendered less likely if the Army hich wasalready mobilised, was equopped with modernarms and weapons. it would be in Germany'interest to provide such weapons. He saidCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19150that in order to give the allies no pretextfor making any attacks on Spanish territoryacts of sabotage carried out foom spain orSpanish must cease. A resumption ofsabotage activities against Gib. was agreedto with certain reservations, and thecontinued use of posts on Spanish territoryfor the observation of shipping in theStraits was alsoagreed to provided that thegreater pirt of thep ersonnel employed atthese posts were Spanish nationals. Wigontold Canaris that Jordana's diseussions widSalazar had resulted in a mutual talk onthe defence of neutrality and in politicaland economic support.Canaris had discussions with Jordana whotook an identical line to that of Wigon.One of the results of this exchange ofviews was that Canaris made urgent] represen-tations to Berlin that the sabotage whichis being undertaken from Spanish Moroccoshould cease, as it is placing difficultiesin the way of >panish acquiescence inGerman activities.The German agent PRY has now confessedthat he had a dual mession. In additionto carry ing out espionage in the Congo itwas alsointended thet he should enable theGermans to intercept secret correspondencepa assing between loyal Belgians in Belgium andBelgian vovt. officials both in London andin the Congo. this it was not only intendedthat he should deliver the letters enturstedto him by GILSON to the persons to whom theyCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191were addressed, including the Belgian Colon-ial Minister in London but that he shoulduse his best endeavours to see that he wasentrusted with the replies and go with themto Lisbon where he was to h ind them over tohis German masters.The A.D.N.I. expressed the view that theLisbon leakages are serious. The dates andnumbers of ships are accurate, but the routeand escort inaccurate.We have just heard that the "Ravenspoint"has got a small bomb in the stern whichexploded in Gib.I had a talk with .C.,Burt and Milmo aboutBOYD whose uncle is eausing a certain amountof trouble by writing letters to officialsabout his nephew. It is proposed to tellthe uncle that ne is doing more harm thagood.There is a good deal of talk about theinefficiency of Americnn troops in N.

He was worried about a report thatwe had received fron ro m Viv. that P.U.E. weregoing to open up on counter-sabotage mattersin the Union. He said that they had nosuch intention. The history of D.O.E. inS.Africa is that they were originally sent outto do a job of work in "adegascar. Afterthe operation was over a small posse was sentto the Union where they have establishedcontact with Col. .Lenton, but have not beenin action except for one small job they didin conjunction with Lenton and on theauthority of Smuts.At the l.Board meeting today it was decidedthat we should run WALENTI ho should infuture be known as BRUTUS, It was agreedhowever that for the moment he could not beused for purposes of deception.I had a word with the D.M.I. about theSecond Front and impressed upon him thatOfficers with Security Service experience coulbe made available and that in our view hada definite function to perform.

They apparently gave him some veryrought treatment at their establishment inDuke St. and then told us that he had hangedhimself. Spilsbury, who has examined the bodywas. rather inclined to think that he mayhave been throttled. The Free French have gotan idea that the methods one employ are no goodCertainly if the purpose is to extract thetruth their methods are no better, since aconfession obtained under duress is in 9cases out l0 perfectly useless. personallyI think it is time that Duke street wasclosed don. There is certainly somethingfishy about the MANUEL case and there is nodoubt that the French 2eme Bureau are extreme-ly worried, as well they might be. MANUELwas supposed to nave hanged himself with hhis shirt and when Brooke-Booth visitedDuke St. ne was shown a pipe from which newas supposed to have hanged himself. easked where the shirt was and was told thatit was on the man's body and that he couldnot therefore see it. When the police wentto the cell the shirt, or part of it, washanging from the pipe.I had a talk with hupert Speir about theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19159Second Front and urged on him the importanceof getting us on the map. What we reallyrequired was some letter from the DMI to theDG in which we were given a definite commit-ment.Hughes talked to me about the C.C.S in hisarea being informed about ZIGKAG.

He says: "In January1940 a Major of the G. A.F. arrived t Cologen route for Munster, carrying with himthe exact detai of the part to be playedby the G.A.F. and paratroops in the invasionof Belgium. Before proceeding to Munsteby train, he called on an old friend, aG.A.F. Major commanding the Cologne aero-drome. The to old friends cracked a bottleof wine togehter The first bottle had, ofcourse, to be rounded off by a second, andthe excellence of the Rhenish wine, combinedwith the convivial atmosphere, sufficed tolead to an agreement that instead of goingon to Munster by train th t ni night ht, themessenger should wait over until the nextmorning, and be flow there by his oldfriend. The to majors duly took off thenext morning, and for causes not yet ascerttained, but prob ably not unconnected withthe quality of the ine they had drunk thepreceding evening, they mistook theMaas for the Rhine, and made a perfectlanding on an lerodrome near Brussels. Theifirst thought on realising their mistakewas to burn their precious plans, but thesetwo highly-placed representatives of themost efficient nation in the vorld did notpossess a single match betieen them, andthe pl ns duly fell into the hands of theBelgian authorities.CatalogueReterence:kvi4fonf Nere torn with79doubts as to hether the Belgians would rreally believe in the authenticity ofthese plans and the stupidity of the officerwho alloed them to fall into Belgin h ends,and finally concluded that the risk wastoo great to be taken. E They thus postponedthe offensive, which was lnned for January1940, until May 1940. Had the offensivetaken place on the date originlly fixed,the terrific frosts which set in at theend of January 1940 would have caught theGerman panzer divisions in the middle ofthe Ardennes, and the whole of the 1940campaign might have ended very differently.Was this luck, or was it Hitler's intuition?At the D.G.

Theyhad not however considered how they veregoing to run the country when these officialhad been deposed. They therefore found itnecessary to leave them in power after thelanding. These officials then demandedthe internment of those who had beenintriguing against them before the linding,and the Americans were forced in this wayto arrest their former suoporters. Thishad naturally led to a great deal of illfeeling and to a highly complicatedpolitic l situation.Herbert found that the French Censorship ververy ready to co-operate, although theymight conta in certain doubtful elements.It was impossible for us to take over theorganisatior on account of personnel indalso for political reasons.

Kreft of .AfricaHouse. He seems friendly and reudy tohelp in any way he can. He told me aninteresting story about an old man calledPRETORIUS who during the last war had oftengone through the enemy' lines. In thiswar he was in charge of the Press Corres-pondents. He was not very popular withthese people as he was always taking themup to the forward area to enable them toget hot news. Most of them prefer to gettheir news at a safer distance. PRETORIUStherefore got rather bored with his job.When the ltalians capitulated he comman-deered the Duke of Aosta's white carwhich wasbeautifully fitted up for safaritrips. He careered about the countryin this car, and finally got it shippeddown to Pretoria. Although this performancewas not reg garded with favour in somequarters, it was generally felt thatPretorius was Pretorius and that he wasentitled to do what he liked, in viewof his magnificent services to the Unionin the last war. He was formerly byprofession a hunter.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19184Frost and I saw the D.G. about the R.S.S.Committee.

There is considerable annoyanin Abwehr circles about their having beenno previous warning concerning the meetingof the M. and Kooseveld at Casablanca.There has been a raspberry to the S.D. andthe Abwehr.Catalogue Reference:kV/4/1911At the joint meeting between ourselves andS.I.S. S.Africa was discussed in the lightof the Lourenco Marques B.J.S. It wasagreed that on no account should PAASCHEbe followed. it was felt that an operationof this kind would be far too dangerousand unlikely to succeed, and that D.F.i .ingwould be much the most profitable line toadopt, when it was decided to close inon the transmitter. It was also agreedthat Michael Ryde should be put fullyin the picture. S.I.S. were opposed tohaving a committee in S. .Africa with powersto handle their information. We alsodiscussed the request of Home Forces thatthey should be allowed to circulate somememo on the Abwehr down to Divisions.Such a memo would be based on Curry's book.Viv. appeared to be opposed to giving suchinformation to the I.B. staff. L said thatI thought this was a difficult attitude toadopt. Surely the principle function ofthe I.B. staff was to counter activitiesof the German I.S. in the field. Couldone therefore say that they should notbe informed about the German 1.S? Viv.seemed to think that the presence of theso-called C. .experts from Glenalmondwould be all that they would require.I said I thought myself that it was desir-able to give the main units of the I.B.staff a nose forfthe Abwehr, otherwise thedocuments and Abwehr personnel capturedwould never reach headquarters.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/191The ,Harry and L had a meeting withD.M.I. and Vale, D.

Many of them hadlanguage qualifications in addition totheir knowledge of security work as a whole.At one point in the discussion the D.M.I.suggested that these officers should behanded over to S.1.S. to form the basisof their S. S.I. ( I. (b) units. Harry explainedthat they had a somewhat different functionto perform, which was more akin to I.B.work. He thought therefore that theyshould strengthen the I.B. staff rather thanthe 1. (b) unit. It was understood by allthat any officers going out on a SecondFront job would lose their identity asmembers of theSecurity Service and becomemembers of the .B.Staff.February 4thWalter Bell came to see me. He told methat Ellis had returned. Ellis says thatStephenson is fed up and likely to resign.Bell also told me about the possible moveof Section V. to London.Major Thompson of M.A.P. came to see meabout the case of BIRKIGT.

Sheen, Major Gilletteand Lt. .Saxe of G.2. L explained to themthat we should be very pleased to give acourse of lectures to G. 2 officers onthe German I.S. and on Security work. Ithought this would be preferable to givingan intensive course to 2 or 3 with a viewto their instructing others, or circulatinga memo to the Chicago School. They allseemed to be in agreement. Meanwhile itappears that there are only very few G. 2officers available in England. Most ofthose who are here are either attached toI.B.units or trying to gain some practicalexperience in N.

If Tin Eye has got any complainabout releases he should make them to meand not to Duff Cooper. Milmo was placedin a rather awkward position. He had to tellDuff quite frankly that there were certaincases handled by Goodacre which we thoughtwere unsatisfactory. We did not in facttrust Goodacre's judgment. Duff's naturalretort was "Ought you not to get rid ofGoodacre?" The to particularlycontroversial cases were those of La GALLEand SZUMLICZ.I had a talk with Alan Hodgkin aboutZIGZAG'S statement on the inyulnerabilityof certain German night-fighters from theeffects of RDF.

GRAUMANN receives the Timesregularly.Victor has had a talk with Clark Kerr, ourAmbassador in Moscow, who gives an extra-ordinary account of Stalin. It took himmany weeks to get an interview. Once insidethe Kremlin he seemed to markh throughendless corridors before reaching St lin'sroom. This was extremely long and sparselyfurnished. A long carpet led from the doorto Stalin's desk. Stalin was wearing a pinksatin shirt. He apparently thinks aloud,addressing remarks to hiiself without lor'looking at his visitor. This is ratherawkward as the remarks are not alwayscomplimentary to the visitor. Just as theconversation started the sirens went. Stalinasked Clark Kerr whether he would like to godown to the shelter. Clark Kerr said he wasuite ascustomed to being bombed and had nodesire to move. Stalin however had made uphis mind to retire to the cellar, where therewas an almost exact replica of his roomCatarogue RrferEnce:k4/opega by asking him97how it was that a man like de COURCY whowas opposed to the opening of a Second Frontremained at large. Surely this meant thathis views were supported by the P.M. ClarkKerr tried to explain that English peoplewere at liberty to hold what views theyliked provided they did not seriouslyimpede the war effort. Stalin seemed unableto grasp that de COURCY' views were oflittle significance and that the majorityof people in this country had not even anyknowledge of his existence. After about3 hours in the shelter and an exchangeof one or two dirty stories, the friendshipwarmed up considerably. They partedapparently on very good terms.The P.M. has got stuck at algiers on his wayback owing to engine trouble. We have beenasked to start a cover story about hispresent whereabouts. One suggestion is thathe is visiting Swinton in N.Africa, anotheris that he is going to see Salazar, and athird is that he has arrived back bere.Personally I .think it would be better tosay nothing, the first is extremely unlikelyand the second highly dangerous. I under-stand that at the meeting at Adana the P.M.promised the Turks arms but made no requestfor intervention.Hamilton-Gay came to see me about a jobin the M. I. 9 Transit Camp.

I showed him the letteralleged to have been written by BIRKIGT.He thinks it was certainly written byPrince PONIATOWSKY, BIRKIGT'S son-in-law.This removes a good de al of the suspicionagainst BIRKIGT as the letter implied thatthe writer had been in Occupied France.I had lunch with Orr who poured out hiswoes about Albert's new section which isdealing with the British subjects returningfrom abroad.Milmo has seen Tin Eye, and told him fairlyfrankly what he thinks of Goodacre and 5 caseCatalogeerrefetencesviarromplain was made to99Duff Cooper.

The D.G. agreed that the proposalSeemed a sound one.Frost has had a very sticky meeting atBroadway about the Kameradschaftsdienst.The meeting was called. by C. at the requestof D.N.I.. D. N. On the Admiralty side werepresent DNI, DDNI. ADNI, and CommanderCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191f00Robertson-MacDonald. For S.I.S. were C.,Gilbert Ryle and Ferguson. A venemousattack was made on Frost by the Admiraltyrepresentatives. Frost and Ryle maintainedthat there never had been a case for anyvery intensive work on secret transmissionsby broadcast. It was extremely doubtfulwhether such breadcasts could be solvedon any uniform basis. The probability wasthat each agent had his own particularcode and that withoute the intelligence know-ledge and background it was a pure waste oftime to try and work it out. In any casesuch messages would be of secondary impor-tance compared with ISOS since they werealmost certainly one-way and therefore limit-ed. This did not of course mean that thematter should not be probed as far as possibleIt could however only have been done in thelight of intelligence from other sources.It was only in recent months that suchintelligence had been obtained. TheAdmiralty put up a lot of accusations aboutearly negligence on the part of Frost whictin some instances they said had amountedalmost to sabotage. The fact is I amafraid that they are talking rather nonsense.I tried to warn Lewes that he was puttinghis foot in it but he seems to have acceptedunreservedly everythi that has been toldhim by Robertson-Macuon ld and Leary, who areSO bitten with this bug that they thinknothing else matters at all.Viv. rang me up about the telegram whichThurston had received from the F.B.I. sayingCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191101that they were quite ready to acdept Millsas our representative in Washington and thatsthis had been arranged in conjunction withthe State Dept. Viv. seemed very perturbedabout thism as he thought it was cuttingright across the tracks of SIS and jeopard-ising their position. He evidently thoughtthat the FBI had taken this action on oursuggestion. I told him that it was quitespontaneous, that nothing had been saidto the FBI about Mills representxxing usin Washingron that had not been said in hispresence. It had merely been discussed in ageneral way as a possibility.The D.G went over the reorganisation ofB.Divn. with myself and Horrocks.

The danger lay not necessar-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1910?ily in the students being anti-Britishor being recruited by the enemy as agents,but in the fact that they would normallybe under the protection of their Embassies,would see members of the Embassy staff, whowould in the ordinary course of theirduties report back any thing that thestudents might have to say about what theyhad seen. I think this view was generallyaccepted. On the second subject theSecurity Service had a definite complaintthat British internees from Germany andItaly had arrived at Lisbon before we weretold any thing about them. The F.O. appearedto have been negotiating since lastNovember but to have told nobody. TheMinistry of Health complained that they hadhad no time to make the necessary arrange-ments for the welfare of those who might bedestitute. It was agreed that in futureas much advance notice should be given aspossible.I took the Nednesday meeting. The bnehrstation at Madrid was recently asked byAlgiers to provide the names and addresseof persons who could beused as letter-boxesto receive reports from Gib.

A Portuguese named GranjaTomas who is a kind of hanger-or at thedocks at Lisbon, was given a letter in codeby the ships cook of the "Edenvale",Christopher EASTNOOD. EASTWOOD had askedGRANJA whether he knew the whereabouts ofof the German Legation. When he said he didhe asked him to deliver the letter.GRANJAhaving a friend in the Press Division ofthe British Consulate, took the letter tohim. It was opened and photographed, andfound to contain code. It was se led upagain and delivered by GRANJA to the GermanLegation. EASTWOOD had collected the letterfrom Donal O'SHEA, a broker of Dublin. Theletter was addressed to the OKW.We have received 12,500 on the conclusionof Plan DREAM.saw Maxwell about getting a letter fromthe H.0. about HARLEQUIN' naturalisation.He has agreed to give us such a letter whichwill in fact promise nothing but will indicatthat if he wishes to become naturalised thestatutory period will count from the dateof his arrival in this country.I also discussed ith Maxwell the projectof establishing someone in the H.0. who wouldmake a special study of all our problemsMaxwell is very sympathetic to the projectCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191ouand agreed in principle not only to theappointment of the individual but thestablishment of a secret registry. He wouldhowever like to have time to think it over.T. T.A.R. R. has had a request through GARBO tosupply the Germans with information aboutourttrain service. This neans that theyprobably contemplate shooting up our trainsin the same way that e are shooting uptheirs in occupied territory. I think theanswer is that there are SO many trains andsince they do not always run at the time thatis scheduled little harm can be done bygiving the Germans the timbtable. TheGerman tactics are apparently to shoot upthe engine and then the passengers if they arfoolish enough to get out of the train.February llthGuild, who is returning to Newfoundland, seemvery pleased with his visit. He is going totry and link up his organisation more closelywith the Canadian ports, and may be able toTo this tactfully through the CanadianNaval authorities. I impressed upon himthat it was extremely important that on noaccount should he give any offence toCommissioner Wood.L took the RSS meeting today. Mellandsupplied information about Moritz He saidthat only 20% of it was, accurate. He thoughtthe XX was possible The Germans appearreply on it and to use some of the informatiooperationally. Group 0 is getting on but isCatalogue Reference:KVI4/110Snot yet out. I raised the question of theSwedish material which I thought wasimportant in view of the absence of any"/T communication between Stockholm andBerlin. Was it possible to get at the landcommunication? Something of the kind hasbeen going on by a process of inductionwhich had enabled certain Sedish authoritiesto tap in on the land line from Oslo toBerlin. It was arranged that this situationshould be explored.Melland and Montagu came to see me.Montaguhas had a raspberry from S.I.S. formentioning MSS at a meeting of the RSSCommittee. I have suggested to him that heshould postpone sending his reply pendinga conversation which I propose to have withC., who I am sure will be entirely reason-able. Melland has just produced a singular-ly important document based on a combinationof LSOS,Spiel material and MSS. Spielmaterial shows what the enemy wish us tobelieve with regard to their defences inthe Mediterranean, and the MSS shows theactual position. Thereby we get anextremely good picture of the enemy' weakspots. I asked Melland who saw reports ofthis kind, since it seemed to me that theywere of first-rate importance and should beon the tables of the Chiefs of Staff withthe least possible delay. He said that hehad to put them up through the usualby the DMI and sometimes by the vcles,hierarchy but that generally they seenand then returned to him. He did not knowwhat action was taken on them or whetherCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191Lobthey were considered by the Chiefs of StaffCommittee. I said that this seemed to bea matter of such great importance that ifhe saw no objection I would have a word withC.

Mountain is very anxiousfor our co-operation.According to a Jap B.J. from Berlin a proposof the differences between the Fuhrer andthe military command, it appears that themilitary want able and talented men ascommanders in chief and a major of intelligen-ce for the Army Supreme Command.

Hewas given some temporary employment at theBritish Embassy in Madrid where he hasbeen associating with other escapees, whosestories he doubtless obtained. De GRAAFwas broken through the mention by him ofhis connection with someone who, accordingto the LRC Index, was believed to beworking for the Germans.

SirStafford Cripps in a moment of indiscretigallowed Sir Frank Spriggs, chairman ofHawkers, to become aware of the fact thatARMSTRONG was at the moment under suspecion.Spriggs then warned ARMSTRONG, called ameeting of the Board, voted ARMSTRONG E6,000in recognition of his services to the companybefore he went to MAP, and arranged that thismoney should be paid into ARMSTRONG'S accountafter banking hours.

They spoke ofthe recent arrival of the Communist DeputyMARTEAU.Maisky has had a somewhat peculiar conversa-tion with the Egyptian Ambassador. Hesuggested to the Ambassador that his Govt.would be well-advised to have a representa-tive at Moscow, since the important powersat the conclusion of this war would not beEngland and America but Soviet Russia andChina. There is little doubt to my mind thatthe Russians intend to lose no opportunityof enhancing their prestige in the Mid East.They are already showing signs of intendingto stay in the parts of Persia which theyhave already occupied. I do not think thatthey a are anxious to bind themselves veryclosely either with ourselves or with theAmericans, When Germany is beaten Russia wiladvance to the Curzon Line. She will leaveus and the Americans to deal with the Japsatalgueerrerererice"kV+4/gke is much trouble foraus as she can in the Mid East. When Japanis beaten to her knees Russia may walk intocertain ports in the far East which shewould like to acquire.February 20thMUTT & JEFF have received a wireless setand E200 which were dropped by parachutejust west of Loch Strathbeg in Aberdeen-shire. This operation had been arrangedwith the Germans and 1 party went up toreceive the set. The plane was heard and alight was flashed. After circling twiceand coming down to about 50 ft. a parachutewas dropped. The set was carefully packedin a canister which had a bag of sand as abuffer to take the shock at the point whereit would strike the ground. It seems tohave worked quite successfully.February 22ndMontero has informed his Govt. abouttheMENEZES case, and asked him to let him havean immediate decision as to whether MENEshould be handed over to the Britishauthorities. He seems to be taking a verysatisfactory attitude.Brooman-White tells me that through a newinformant he has obtained a nuuber of docu-ments from the Spanish Consulate in Newcastledating back to 1940. There is one documentin particular signed by Alba in which herequests the consul on the orders of theCatarogpieskefeireifcerkv4/1ggreign Affairs to supplyIIIhim regularly with reports of air raiddamage, and particularly damage to militaryobjectives. We are keeping these documentswith a number of others of a somewhatsimilar kind as I think there may be a timewhen they will make useful stick with whichto beat the spanish Govt.I had a meeting with Briscoe and Victorabout eexamination of property at theLRC. -t was decided that Briscoe shouldgo down and see what equipment is requiredand how it could best be operated. it wasthought that a small portable set mightalso be required for use at 020 or at thelaboratory.I had a meeting with Harker, Allan, McIverand Pearson about a future Second Frontcourse. It was decided to have anothercourse early in March with a few SCOs,representatives of the LRC,02 and others witwithin the office who might usefully beinvited. Harry will arrange for our officersto attend an Ib course and certain C.C.A.0.lectures.I saw C. in the afternoon and discussed withhim the S.S. and S.I.S. Conference or LOW Lev-el committee. I said that I thought it wasextremely important that Melland and Montagushould be allowed to refer to MSS when it hada bearing on ISOS. He entirely agreed andsaad that he would like to have a talk withMelland. I then told him about Melland'reports and my fears that they might not begetting to the right quarters. He said thatCatalogue Reference:KV14/191curiously enough he had been thinking of thishimself. He had wanted to have a talk withMelland but did not quite see how he coulddo it without telling the DMI. The questionof discussing MSS at the LOW Level Committeewould however give him the opportunity hewanted. He would take an early opportunityof getting hold of Melland.C. is a little worried about the veryclose relations between the Czechs andRussians and asked me to let him haveany information which had a bearing on thissubject.He told me that BONNEFUSSE and PAILLOL wereto set up a 2eme Bureau here on behalf ofGiraud. Rivet is in .Africa and SOis Slesser, who wants to fight. Slesserhad all his records which he asked theFleetto take to N.Africa but he thinks they musthave fallen into German hands. C. broughtPassy and Rivet together. Rivet takes theline that he is the official 2eme Bureauand that Passy is merely an amateur. He isquite ready to work with Passy if thelatter cares to come in under him. Thereis no solution of this problem at the moment.C. is worried about the arrangements betweenthe Dutch and SOE for the reception of agentsHe thinks that things are going badly wrong.He told me that Laval's bodyguard was armedalmost entirely with SOE tommy-guns.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/191114The Americans apparently put up a terribleshow in N. .Africa They did not seem ableto stand up to dive-bombing.The Americans have been partially respon-sible for dealing with German BJs.

It is felt that if a conviction canbe obtained this will act as a markeddeterrent on the members of other Legationswho might be prepared to act in a similarmanner. MENEZES' only excuse SO far is thatCatalogue Reference:kV/4/191he was blackmailed into working for theGermans on account of certain relativeshe had in Germany.I spoke to Tin Eye today about the complaintthat had been made to Duff that head officehad not accepted 20 recommendations forrelease. I said that we must be the finaljudges in these matters and that in any casethat had been brought to my notice I wasquite satisfied that the inviduals inquestion should not be released. tin Eyesaid that his main anxiety had been thatthese questions did not reach my level.I said that this might be SO but that inthis particular instance I had seen thepapers. I saw papers before a releasewas granted and I also saw papers before aprosecution was embarked upon. I saidthat the cases to which exception had beentaken had invariably been those conductedby Goodacre. While L thought that he wasa very careful, painstaking officer, I didthink he had certain blind spots. Tine byewas inclined to agree. On the other handhe did not wish to get rid of Goodacre unlessanother job could be found for him andalso a suitable substitute. He was veryemphatic that nothing should stand in theway of the efficiency of 020 and if I wasdissatisfied With Goodacre, he would have togo. I said that we would try and see if itwas possible to make any other suitablearrangement, but that I thought it would begood for all concerned if Goodacre weretransferred to other spheres. Tin Eye saidthat he was in great difficulty whe officialCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19111bvisits were paid to 020. Duff who saw 020reports always wished to talk to the officerspersonally and sometimes in Stephen's absenceHe naturally asked them their views whichthey felt bound to express. These might notalways coincide with our opinion. He thoughtthe only way out of the difficulty was tomake his oficers record in writing any suchinterviews and to send these up to mepersonally. I should then at least knowwhat was going on.I then raised the question of extra copiesof 020 reports. If he required assistanceI would see that he got it. I thoughthowever it was essential that we should haveat least 8 copies at head office. Threewere required for B.IB, one for the FBI, onefor Security Vo-Ordination, and in certaincases one for B. B.IC 1C and one for B.lA or anyother section of .Divn. There was alsothe problem of E.Divn whose only chance ofgetting to know how a spy operated was bystudying 020 reports. Tin Eye promised toarrange for these copies to be sent up.Burt told me that the CANSLEY case had beenextremely badly handled owing to thenegligence of the inspector in charge ofScotland Yard. Burt is actively pursuingthe HOYSE case.L went to see the DMI about the letter addres-sed to him by the H.O. in the case of WURMANN.I wanted him to sign a covering letter tothis which would give added weight.

Harry thoughtit would be better signed by ol.Barry.I saw Robson Scott about the Czechs, andabout MALIK. He seemed to think that actionshould be taken.Herbert told me about Mirko ROT, who has givedetails about wax and Moritz. He said thata White Russian in the Soviet Embassy inCatalegae RfeYerceK4m9for the Germans hadJIShad gone back to Russia some time ago wherehe had got into touch with relations on theGeneral Staff. On his return he had estab-lished a wireless set which his Russiansfriends had been using to communicateninfor-mation. This came through 8 station justoutside Sofia.

Frost more reless describedthe work of his office. He complained tothe D.G. that he did not have very satis-factory liaison with the B.Sections.I took the RSS Committee meeting and announc-ed the new constitution. We discussed thesituation in S.

Hehas evidence that ROT is lying about hisassociation with the Abwehr and that hiswife knows it. They have beteen them someE20,000 brought here before the war, someof it in the form of jewellery. We havedecided to send the husband to 020 and thewife to Nightaingale Lane after cancellationof her landing condition. We hope in thisway to get the exact truth. Probably ROTis reluctant to admit that he was actuallyworking for some considerable time on behalfCataloge Catalogteererererrce:KV4/1btHis information SO far has1 21been quite important.

S request I went with Frost tosee Duff Cooper. The D.G. wished Duff tobe in the picture about the history of ourrelations with RSS before the meeting vasheld to discuss the constithtion of theHigh and LOW Level Committees.Burt told me about the HOY SE case. He saidthat Kendall appears to be a little put out.There has evidently been sone sort of troubleraised by S.B. who think that B.5 are steal-ing their thunder.March 2ndThe D.G. spoke to me about the WITT case. Hethinks we are wasting our time by furtherinterrggation. I have persuaded him to letus go on for a bit. I am not at all satis-fied about the case.OCatalogue Reference:kV/4/19:a3The D.G. has agreed at a meeting today toanother course being started for RSLOS and SCOCay ze is to look further into the Admiraltyand Min. of War Transport aspect of theLisbon convoy leakages. He has alreadyestablished that a large number of people, dowdown to the rank of perintendent of Ship-ping Companies are bound to know approx-imately the daten f sailing, nature of carcargo and destination of a convoy nearly amonth before it sails. The possibility ofleakage from the Americans is to be furtherconsidered.A meeting was held at Kinnaird House todayto discuss the constitution and personnelof the High and LOW Level RSS committees.It was agreed that the High Level committeeshould be called the Radio Security Committeeand that members of either party could beco-opted as necessary, including the chairmanof the Low Level committee, which will beknown as the Radio Security IntelligenceConference. The question of signals securitywas raised. G-P deprecated precipitateaction. He said he would be seeing Brig.Fladgate of Army Signals on the l6th Marchand would get his views. I said that I didnot think we could withhold information inour possession and that we should put forwarda paper to the JIC in order that they couldif necessary bring the matter to the noticeof the Chiefs of Staff. This was finallyagreed, subject to the memo being submittedto G-P for any remarks that he might have tomake.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19124March 3rdI attended a meeting at Kinnaird House atwhich were discussed (1) the proposedestablishment of a transit censorship baseat Dakar, (2) the Censorship Policy inrelation to Manpower and)the proposeddiscontinuance of the D. 4 Daily Report.with regard to (1), it was decided thata transit base should be established atDakar at the earliest possible moment. Asregards (2) this was not thought to be a mat-ter which the Executive could usefully pursue.It was pointed out that while it wasdesirable that unnecessary workers inCensorship should be drafted into theServices or industry, there were numbersof people employe in Censorship who wouldnot be suitable for other work. The M/Lhad not been able to find other employmentfor members of the staff whom the Censorshipwere willing to release. "ith regard to item(3) it was thought that the informationpreviously distributed to departments inthe D.4 report was now reaching them throughother channels. It was agreed to discontinuethe report and to invite the Seamen andOverseas Shipping Committee to consider thebest means of ensuring the continuance ofthe services hitherto provided through themedium of the daily report for the Ministryof War Transport and the Security Executive.I attended the Wednesday meeting. Milmospoke about the case of de GRAAF and saidthat we knew of losses sustained on thees,cape routes which were probably due to him.Catalogue Reference:kV/4/19.75I said I thought the matter of his employ-ment without being vetted by the wadridEmbassy, and all similar cases of employ-ment, of which we had heard of several,should be taken up in high quarters.Later I hada discussion with Viv. and the D.G.about America and also about the Lisbonleakage case. As regards America, Iasked Viv. point blank whether he had anyobjection to Mills taking up a positionin the FBI at Washington. He said that hisobjection was only a technical one, by whichI think he meant that we were outside the3-mile limit.March 4thBurt is actively pursuing the HOYSE case.He had what must have been an extremelyentertaining interview with HOY SE. HOYSEat first wanted to call his solicitor, towhich Burt replied "Certainly - a very wiseprecaution Mr. Hoyse". HOY SE later thoughtbetter of it, rang up Burt and said he wasprepared to make a statement. HOYSE isnot yet aware of the extent to which hisbanking transactions are known and is likelytoput his foot in it pretty badly.The D.G. told me today that he had seen Rawliwho had every confidence in Jock Whyte andwould be delighted to see him'as the officerrepresenting the Security Service at theM.I.9 Transit Camp. The D.G. has clearly madeCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19126up his mind, and there is no use my sayingthat past interrogitions had not been verysatisfactory since Jock had the habit ofputting all his cards on the table face up.Wiesner who is interrogating WITT, has putin a stool-pigeon. WITT has told the latterthat he had been in wireless communicationwith Germany from Sweden, that he was at onetime in touch with the Abwehr in Hamburg,that he was a member of the NSDAP and hadknown Heydrick, that wireless transmissionfrom a flat was impossible but it was aswell that we should suspect him as otherswere doing the work. He went on to say thathe was directed while in Denmark by aGestapo announcement that he was a wantedman. He was afraid about the interrogationof his wife and of torture. Equally hefeared interrogation himself at the handsof the Czechs. He wanted to know if the14 spies executed had confessed, particularly"der grosse Hollander". Even if brokendown, he would not give away his accomplices.A B.J. indicates that the Portuguese suspectthat their bag has been opened but do notwish to raise the matter.Kellar came to see me about a possible job inthe Mid East. I told him that I thoughtthere might be an opening for him here sinceif Maunsell's office developed on the lineswe hoped it would, the general flow ofinformation to this country from Cairo andvice versa would be considerably increased.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/191121J.C. had devised a plan whereby a blownagent can indicate that he is under control.The simple device is that he should begineach of his messages with a pronound ifhe is under control and with a verb if he isnot.A telegram has been sent to Mills at DuffCooper's request asking him whether he hasdiscussed any matter with the FBI whichmight have caused them to notify as of theState Dept. agreement.I had a talk with Carew-Robinson and Colesabout somebody in the H.O. to representour interests. We all agreed that he mustbe an H.0. official, thatit would be prefer-able if he could be an existing H.0. employeebut failing that, we would see what we coulddo to provide someone.TheH. are considering the case of MALIKwho may be prosecuted.March 6thI saw waxwell about the case of WilliLORENZ who has written to the Lord ChiefJustice. He wants to make application forhisrelease, on the basis of Justice Humphreysarticle. We cannot prevent him althoughthere is no chance of his succeeding.I told Maxwell about our meeting with CarewRobinson and Coles. He said he thought itwould be dif'ficult for the H.O. to supplyCatalogue Reference9mp/191 He would be glad to128know if we could think of a suitable candidateThe JIC are to discuss the question of acourier service between this country andSwitzerland in exchange for the Germansbeing allowed free access to Afghanistan,Portuguese E. Africa, Argentine and Eire.I cannot imagine how anybody in their rightmind could have put up such a cock-eyedsuggestion.Machell has been given notice by the D.G.He is very upset. These things are donein a very peculiar way. I had no idea thatthe axe was going to fall.Frost has prepared his memo on SignalsSecurity for the J.I.C.Catalogue eference:KV/4/19129March SthI had a meeting with WIESNER, Dick, Milmoand Sneath about Otto WITT. Wiesnerwas very confident that if he could employhis own methods he could break WITT downwithin 3 days.H Suggested that WITTshould be interrogited at frequent inter-vals both during the night and day orternatively that ne should be given tothe Czechs for 3 days, at the end of whichNiesner gave a guarantee to h nd himback without a bruise on his body andwrapped in cotton wool and silver paper.Our general conclusion was that HITTthough arragant was a physical coward.He had prob ably built himself up to aconsiderable extent on the eytes on theS.I or the Gestapo, more probably thelatter, and had volunteered to getinformation about the activities ofStrasser's organisation in this country.We were rather disinclined to believe his Sstory that he had told to the stool-pigeon HAAS about his having a Vorsatz-Gerat which could be used for the con-version of a receiver into a transmitter.Sneath on the other hand had seen WITTleaving his flat with something heavy.There is t suggestion in conversations vitnIAAS th t this apparatus had been leitwith one of WITT'S accomplices. Themost likely Nould be the FEDERNS who he satsaw before his internment. The fatheris apparently all right but the son isextrenely doubtful. WITT has poastedCatalogue Reference:K4/191 about his connections30with the S.S. and also about a link withthe Abwehr at Hamburg. He took HAAS intohis confidence because the latter was theson of a general and because he knew thathe had a brother in the S.S. WITT isterrified of being h inded over to the Czechsince he thinks they would probablytorture him. He is quite certain thatthe British Nill not. When conironted withHAAS he denied every ything that he hadtold him. It was finally decided thatWITT should be told by some suitableofficer that as he was clearly Lyingand would not come clean, Ne had no alter-native but to hand him over to the Czechsor the Russians, but before doing SO wewanted to give him a final chance to comeclean. He would probably find Britishjustice better than Czech or Russian. I1this bluff fails we shall fall back ontelling him he will be handed over to teInternational Tribunal as soon as the waris over, and that ne will thereby losethe protection of the British uovt.Dick and I saw Harker and Horrocks Nitthe D.G. about Egypt. 1 suggested to theD.G. that it might be preferable i1 Hay lorand orrest bota went out together. whenHay lor had set the local LRC on its feet hecould return and leave Forrest in harge.Thiswould ensure that the Egyptiun LRCwould get on its feet in the shortestpossible time. It was agreed tat Steph-enson S hould go out to do what Hart isdoing here and tht Baxter should be pproaCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19131approached about running the LRC duringHaylor's absence.I had a meeting With McIver, Dick, Allan,and Glover about the next course. Theyhave got the sy llabus sketched out andMcIver is going to arrange about collectingthe bodies.March 9thI saw Barratt from Lisbon PCO withMars,Adam and Albert, about the examinationof British subjects in Lisbon. Barrettwho is a member o1 the Repatriation Com-mittee there is going to take er thiswork. I said that I thought he shouldmake it his business to extract as muchinformation as he possibly can and make aspecial note of all contacts, addressesetc. He should encourage all appliantsfor visas to talk as much as possible sinceit was only in this way that we couldget the necessary data for the purpose ofchecking up their stories. He should notconfine himseli solely to those in Cat.B,namely those whom for one reason oranother he reg rded issuspeet. It nas beearranged that he will allocate thepriorities. This will enable him to getrid of those whom he thinks are of nosecurity value and ensureythat fullreports about the suspects will each usbefore they arrive in the U.K. I have ar-ranged for Barratt to visit the LRC.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19The D.G.S meeting lasted L minute.Iarrived 13 minutes late and consequentlymissed the proceedings. Adam arrived 2 min-utes later amidst roars of laughter.I had a word with Hollis who has beenasked by Section V. whether he couldsupply somebody versed in communism toassist Mills. I wendered a little whatreturn we were Likely to get fromsending another officer to Section V. itseemed to mme that we could get all wewented in the western hemisphere directfrom Thurston and that in SO far as otherPCO points were concerned they were muchtoo occupied in obtaining informationabout Germans to bother With communism.I discussed with Hollis the suggestionthat Ne should have a Peter Loxley atthe H,O. He seemed to think the ideawas a good one and undertook to thinkabout a suitable candidate.I gave a talk to the RSLOS. There were only7 as the remainder have all been on theSecond Front course. I thought itdesiralble at this stage to give them amore intimate picture of our NorK, partic-ularly rlbasic sources and to explainto them how B.lA sources were cross-checkedby Hart's, and how therefore we were ableto speak with a certain amount of confi-dence about the measure of success orfailure achieved by the Germans I.S.in their operations Painst this country.We could not disgard B.la sources unlessCatalogue REferenee:ofa/r91dissd ISOS ind this1 33for many reasons was quite impossible.theTorch operation had largely borne outour conclusions since it seemed to bedue to the control that we exercisedover the enemy's organisatior in thiscountry that the details about the opera-tion had not reached the Germans. didnot wish to be complacent since there werecertain obvious gaps in our organisation.19 out of 43 agents captured in this countsince the outbreak of war had not beenreflected in Hart's sources. ri certainnumber of unsatisfactory cases had to bepassed through the LRE. WURMANN8S evidenceshowed that signal security was bad andthat the enemy were well informed aboutthe disposition of our units. Use waspossibly being made of P/W and interneemails and the mails of allied forcesfor clandestine correspondence. We hadthe example of the evasion of censorshipof Belgian refugees in this country whowere communicating with their relativesin occupied territorynby means of a counerand postbox via Eire. Lastly there had beera number of doubtful British subjects re-turning to this country rom the Continentand N. Africa. To meet this situation we wewere contemplating some intermediary placeof detention between the LRC and Camp 020where LRC cases could be better examined.We were placing an officer with the M.I.9Transit Camp to deal with returning P/WSand we had opened a new office at DevonshireHouse to deal with doubtful returningBritish subjects.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19134I then talked about the enemy alien andalien problem, referred to the bad Cases thrthro n up by Sneath and said that even ifwe thought the spy content among enemyaliens was small and possibly dormant,there was the long term view to be onsidereIt was still desirable to know as much aspossible about these people since at theend of the war their repatriation wouldprobably be considered on the merits ofeach case.I outlined the latest developments in theorganisation of censorship and the typesof material which ere at the moment beingsubmitted to secret ink test. These sere(a) outward air and surface mails t8/SSatnPortugal Switzerland and Sweden in whichit was known that the enemy has or hadcover addresses; (b) the testing andduffing of inward air and surface mailsfrom these places and addressed to personswith foreign na es and persons who couldotherwise be identified as of alien national-ity in Gt Britain, N. Ireland and Eire;(c) transit mails from .Irelandand Eire to all European countries, and(d) secret test leaving no detectable traceof mail sent by allied forces to Europeancountries. Lastly I said a few wordsabout our DSO points in Mid East, Northest and South Africa, India, the Caribbeanand the USA and then gave a short accountof our probable commitments in the eventof the opening of a Second Front.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/191f 35I had a long and tedioussmeeting withAdam, Cheney,Foster,Blake Budden, Horrocksand Stopford, on Adams's suggestion thathis S.C.0.s shald no longer supply useyiththe alterations in crei? lists of coastalvessels or examine members of the crewof such vessels. The examination isimportant since it appears that anyone Cantravel as a passenger from one port toanother on a coastil vessel. Adams nopesthat by cutting some of nis staff down ne mamay get a higher percentage of Cfiicers.He thinks he should concentrate on vesselssailing to Eire or foreign ports rather taron coastal traffic. We all agreed thatEire was important but we were inclined todoubt thether intensive examination Cf thepassengers and crew proceeding to the"estern Hemisphere vere of any great valuefrom the espionage paint of view. I emphas-ised the fact that we had already agreed tocut down xmination of the correspondenceto 10%. It was agreed that the existingpersonnel should continue to examinethe cres of coastal vessels as fr asthey were able and that Cheney and Fosterwould indicate to hd am There economy couldbe effected in sending in reports of adetailed kind about seamen who had ultimate]-ly been cleared.Forrest talked to me for some time todayabout the Newcastle Police. de had foundit an extremely uphill job to get themeducated on our lines.

She has in factproducted very remarkable documentaryinformationand looks like being a first-class inior-mant.Cecil and I dined with Walter Bell andCol.Bruce, head of OSS in this country.Bruce is a very charming, cultured Americ n.I had heard fram Thurston that ne intendedto operate in Ireland and in fact hadalready had two agents there. By way ofthrowing a fly over him L turned to con-versation to Eire generally, but de didnot rise. I told him that although therewere of course many opportunities forleakage of information, Te had no evidencthat the Germans nad a collecting centrefor reports that they might receive fromlabourers and others returning to Eire onceevery 6 months on leave. I pointed outthat if there waseany organisatior of thiskind. it would have to be on very widescale if there was to be any continuityto the information received.. It wouldtherefore be difficult to organise nytningof the kind without its existance becomingCatalogue ReferencekV/4llodes I learn thatOSS is opening up in Indid. The JIC do137not propose to raise any objection providedany action is controlled by the C. in C orC.S.S.The JIC hadbefore them today a papersuggesting that in exchange for a courierservice between this country and Switzer-land we might allow the Germans facilitiesto communicate with Portuguese colonies,the Argentine, Afghanistine and Eire.I have not yet heard the result of thediscussion but it is difficult to see howsuch a hare-brained suggestion couldreceive any support. One of the advan-tages which we are supposed to gain isthe facilities for sending propaganda toSwitzerland, though what effect anypropaganda disseminated in Switzerland atthis stage in the war could possiblyhave it is difficult to comprehend. Ourview is that we get nothing from Switzer-land in any case and have not done SOsince the outbreak of war, even though itis a traditional centre of German espionage.On the other hand the Germans would beonly too pleased to have bag communicationto Lourenco Marques, wnence their activitiesare directed against the Union, to Afghan-istan, centre of their intrigues againstIndia, to the Argentine their base forattacking U.S.A., and to Eire, whencethey can attack this country. Quiteapart from this there is the G. ( &c C Sangle. We stand to gain every time bydriving the Germans on to the air.March lOthCatalogue Reference:KV/4136the G. has had a letter from Duff, whoafter consultation with the P.M. hassuggested that we should furnish the P.Mwith a monthly report. It should not beloo long and should only include itemsof major importance. I suggested thereshould be contributions from Hart, Milmo,T.A.R., LRC, Hollis and occasionally itemsof interest received from DSO points abroad.Dick is going to get out a rough draftwhich we will then diseuss. There areobvious advantages in selling ourselves tothe P.M who at the moment knows nothingabout the activities of the Department.On the other hand he may, on seeing someparticular item, go off the deep end and Wwant to take action, which will bedisastrous to the work in hand.At the Wednesday meeting Hart gave examplesof further cases of leakage from Lisbon.There was one about a convoy due to sail inmid-March which was more or less accurate.Again the informaation is said to comefrom the consulate, the agent having saidthat he actually saw a document in theconsulate. While it seems doubtful whetherthe agent did in fact see any such documentwhich would not normally go to Lisbon atall, it does seem probably that he has infact got something to do with the Consulate.I have suggested that Hart should draft afurther letter to Viv. on these lines.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19THISISA COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS139ACT 1958.Milmo talked about the MENELES case.

I told him to discuss the matterwith Stopiord and he would put him in thepicture. His point is that if by any chanceything went wrong he would be ble totake the necessary action with the police.I had a long talk with Luke who has justcome back from S.Africa. He has put ina very good report. Attempts to set upsome central security organisition inS. .Africa have unfortunately failed.

TheS.African authorities nererinformed aboutRobey LEIBRANDT through a nocturnal visitthey received from Gerling, Van Renzberg'sprincipal assistant and reputed ring-leader, of the unruly section of the OssewaBrandweg, to the Minister of the InteriorlIt was as a result of this visit thatthe spy was eventually caught.I dined with Peter Reid who has just comeback to take up a position in AdmiraltySignals. I told him about our problem ofSignal Security, but emphasised that Ldid not think that the Admiralty were theguilty party. We were much more concernedwith the W.0. and Air Ministry. He willhowever look into this aspect of his workand let me know what he thinks. He seemedto think that the American Navy, in spiteof a number of disasters, were getting ontheir feet. They have some useful torpedoarrcraft, which is really the weapon ofthe day. It is impossible for the Fleetto operate in reasonable safety unlessthey have a proper air umrella. This wasof course what was lacking SO seriously tthe time of Singapore and led to the-disasters of the Prince of Wales andthe Repulse.March llthI spoke to Viv. and told him about Luke'sreturn. I thought that there might beconsiderable advantage in Luke making acareful study of the recent Most SecretCatalogue Reference:kV/4/191byS.African material since he vas soaked inS.African politics and might be able tomake a useful contribution. Viv.agreed.The D.G. spoke to me about our memo forthe J.I.C. on Signal Security. He wantsto pass a copy of it to G-P for his commentsI explained to him that in fact G-P hadrefused to accept responsibility forSignal Security and that we now had ourlinks with the various signals branchesof the Services. Moreover it was said thatG-P was not perticuarly persona gratawith the Military bignals, though I reallycould not say whether this was true or not.The D.G. said he wished to send a copy toG-P as he had undertaken to do SO when hesaw him at lunch yesterday.Duff Cooper has asked us to refrain fromsending Mills to Washington until theposition of Security Co-ordination iscleared up. For this we shall have toawait the return of Stephenson. The delayin this matter is really intolerable.ihave just had a long personal and confidential letter from Commissioner Wood with aserious of complaints against D.S.C. It seeseems that Gooch was sent up from New Yorkmore than a year ago to enquire intoJap activities at Vancouver. For thispurpose he remited an agent named AllanROESCH. ROESCH provided a lot of informatiowhich the R.C.M.P. say was wholly unreliableand subsequently allegations were made inthe press against the integrity of theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191143R. C.M.P. These it appeared were promptedby ROESCH and possibly also by D.S.C. Afull enquiry was held by Judge Cameronwho found that ROESCH'S information wasbased on hearsay, and completely whitewashed.the R.C.M.P. A great deal of money andtime had been wasted, and the R.C.M.P.feel quite definitely thet they have beendouble-crossed. Then came the incidentof Port Security with an onslaught onWood backed by the Service Dept. S Thisagain caused grave irritation. finallyStephenson had sent Bavin to Ottawa as aLiaison Officer with the Canadian Police.Bavin was an eX-R.C. V.P. man who had beenfound unsatisfactory. Wood thereforerefused to accept him. He hadnbeen sentto Ottawa with no previous warning byStephenson. In forwarding me thisinformation Wood said that "I prefer towrite to you personally in this matter inthe hope that some rectification Can bemade without an open clash which woulldmean action through official channels.I also got a long letter from Millsdescribing the lamentable state of affairsin the offices of D.S.C. New York.Dick has taken over the chairmanship ofwhat is now known as the Radio SecurityIntelligence Conference, formerly theS.S. &c S.i.S. Committee.

He broke downand said thi he had been lying, and wouldnow tell us the whole truth. Unfortunatelybefore Caroe left he told him that hepersonally did not believe that WITT wasa spy. We feel that it is now desirableto bring in some new military person todo the interrogation and have obtainedthe services of Major Scotland. IVe wantif possible to carry out the interrogationat the London District P/W camp, butthis will h ive to be subject of H.O.approval. I saw Maxwell and asked himwhether ne had any objection. He said thatas the man was a German detained underthe noya al Prerogative, we couldrho himwhere we liked. He was interested in theWITT case and would like to know in duecourse what we got out of it.March 12thThe Czechs are a little crestfallen aboutthe WITT case being taken over by Scotland,but every thing has been smoothed overto theinsatisfaction.

He is still veryworried about his position. He has putup a memo to the D.G. about a co-ordinatedresearch section between ourselves andS.I.S. but he is not very sanguine aboutthe proposal. He has also sketched outa plan for writing up a history of theoffice since the beginning of the war.Inputting this forward he has pointed outto the D.G. that it is rather like a manof 40 trying to write his biography.He thinks it would be better for sectionsto write up their own subjects.and to post-pone the mmalgamation until the war isover when we shall be able to present amore complete picture. He also pointsout that the publication of such a report atthis moment might raise controversialissues and implied criticisms.The D.G. wants to discuss my reports onthe enemy alien and lien situation. Headmits that the cases that Sneath hasthrown up have been badly investigated butis inclined to say that the trouble startedin .Division where it was impossible todeal with them owing to pressure of work.This may be true but for the last 10months or two years the cases have beenhandled by a variety of sections inE.Division and if we want to go backfurther we should find that Jock Why tewas the trouble.

I could seethat he had already made up his mind aboutthe enemy aliens position and tht it Wasnot the slightest use arguing. He had got iit into his he id that only 3 cases had cometo light, that although they had been badlyhandled they were in no way symptomatieand that in any case enemy aliens in thiscountry were not spies and therefore of nosignificance, not even on a long term basis.He seemed to think it would be quitesufficient if he had a word with Dennistonwho of course has no idea of investigation.DeG. does not intend to bring EDivisienin more actove touch with B. by giving themsomebody who knows something about B. vorkand methods of investigation.

He cannot however get him tocome cleant the only previous falsehoodon which MITT now recants is that he wasever attempting to get into touch withEmbassy circles. This makes his visithere even more peculiar, the trouble isthat this C ase has been SO messed aboutthat he is OW convincted that we havenothing on him and cannot bring him tojustice. Scotland thiinks that Wiesnershould now return to the charge.There is to be a meeting tomorrow on Chiefsof Staff level to discuss the Lisbon leakageEverybody seems to have got suddenlyexcited about them as they were relayed onM.S.S. AD.i.I. has unfortunately got itinto hishead that a man called WELLINGSof the Elder Dempster Line, who may havebeen responsible for certain indiseretionsin Liverpool some time ago, is a spy andprovides the key to the whole matter.It is extremely improbable that he has anyconnection with it at all, since theleakages in question epncerned operationconvoys with which WELLINGS is in noway connected. I am sure that we stand nochance of getting to the bottom of thisaffair until we send someone to Lisbon tomake enquiries about the h angers-on at ourconsular and shipping offices.Luke has spent to me about his examinationof the SAfrican B.J.S.

Moreover wnoever goes outNill have totake his instructions fromLondon. te also pointed out to the D.G.that there wer 5 people nO! running theFelix Case, Section V, Section Vi and our-selves. The matter is furthercomil lic tiedby the fact that Section V do not pass usrelevant information that tneyare receivingfrom Lourenco Marques. Luke has furnishedan extremely good report on all theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1910material relating to the Felix case which isin our possession. He does not agree withT-R that Felix is identici ith Pirow.Hethinks heis more likely to be SITTIG, aGerman who was interned in S. S.Africa,-eseape .Africa, -eseapedto Lourenco Marques, was sent back to theUnion and re-interned, but agin escapedand is now believed to be at large. Meawhile ne has ascertained that Muggeridgehas paid a visit to Brig.baston oi theS.African Police in connection ith thevisit oi von PAASCHE of the German Consulateto the Union. Muggeridge was told towatch FAASCHE'S movements, and learningtrough an informant that he was likely togo to the Union, has, presumably on his own,put the .African police on the track. Thisis most unfortunate and quite possiblythere may be dieaster.At a meeting with Section V. we Hadcallagreed that it ould be much better not toattempt to follow ra SCHE to the Union and tileave the ulitmate liquidation of Telixto a D.F. ing process. the D.G. has decideto write a letter to C. about the hand-ling of this whole case and to discuss thematter with Vivian and Cowgill at theednesday meeting.Janssn of in.

The P.M mightspeak to. the Home Secretary about it andif the latter was not also informed we shoulfind ourselves in trouble. We eventuallydecided to draft something and see whatit looked like. Dick will be editor ofthe B.Division material.I had a talk with Hollis about doingsomething more about Soviet espionage.There is no doubt to my mind that it isgoing on and that sooner or later we shallbe expected to know all about it. On theother hand if we take action and get foundout there will be an appalling stink. Hollisand I are going to discuss the matterwith Loxley on Monday.Duck's operation was successfully performedlast Saturday and G C c C S will now beCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191159able to carry on for some months.One of the code messages carried byEAST OOD of the "Edenvale" for deliveryto the Germans at Lisbon has appeared onISOS. It indicates that consideration isbeing given to the formation of an anti-Communist army in Eire under O'Duffy. Itis not clear whether the intention is toget this army out to the Russian rontor whether the scheme is likelyto act asa cover for a revolutionary body in Eireitself.I rang up. Viv to suggest that we shouldhave a meeting tomorrow about .Africa.He said that unfortunateoy he could notmanage it as he had to see Bruce of OSSabout the projected activities of OSS inEire. I suggested some other time but hereplied that he could not fit it in. Heasked what aspects of the S. African problemwe wished to discuss. I said that it wasrather difficult to go into it all on thetelephone but that firstly we were ratherin the dark about the S.1.S. represen-tative who I had heard wasgoing out to theUnion, and secondly that the Felix organisa-tion seemed to be falling between 3 stools,namely Sections V and Vw and ourselves.pointed out that we were unaware of what waspassing between Section V and LourencoMarques but that it seemed to me from whatI had heard tha Muggeridge, in his ignor-ance of the material on which we were workinghad already got into touch with the S.AfricarCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191$3police who were in pursuit of PAASCHE. Iwas under the impression that we had agreedthat this was not the right course to adoptand that when it had been decided to liqui-date Felix this should be done by someD.F.ing process. Viv. said that as regardstheir representative he had alreadyindicatedtthe possibility of sending someoneout and this had now been arranged betweenOS.i.s.,the F.O. and the D.0. this did nothowever imply that he would not be co-opera-ting closely with lebster. 1 said thatwhile we had no objection to their havinga man in the Union, there was a dangerthat such representation might make Webster'sposition rather ridiculous. Moreover Icould not see any real necessity for suchanappointment. The man they were sending ouhad never been in .Africa before and couldonly act as a kind of conduit-pipe for theB.J.S, the existence of which was alreadyknown to Ryde. I asked him whether thisaction implied a vote of no confidence inWebster. v.demurred somewhat and thensaid that he thought that in matters ofsuch importance and delicacy in was necessarfor S.I.S. to have their own representativeon the spot.H telegram from our High Commissioner inS.Africa to the D.O. rather indicates thatSmuts hae dexigns on Lourenco warqueS.Harlech does not however think any suchaction is inminent, and if the submarinescare dies down nothing will happen. Thereis no doubt however that quite a number ofCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191isupoliticians in the Union have imperialistideas about Portuguese E. Africa.Loxley rang up about AZCARATE, the eX-Spanish Republican diplomat beingbilled in "Russia Today " to speak at ameeting the title of which was given as"The Free Peoples of the World salute theSoviet Union". The 1.0. take a rathergrave view of this since they think itmight embroil them in difficulties withFranco Spain. They contemplate having afriendly talk with AZCARATE. I suggestedto Loxley that it might be a good thing forhim to speak to Maxwell, and I warned himthat AZCARATE might go to Maiski and alsoto certain M.P.S, who might be disposed toask questions in the House.March 17thAt the B.meeting today Hart stated tht theGerman I.S in Madrid vere making rrange-ments to send an agent to the U.K. calledJACOBSEN. This man Nould be working forthe ilitary Section and would beprovided with a cover address in Lisbon.The leakages attributed to the BritishConsulate in Lisbon are still going on, butmuch of the information is incorrect.Jim Hale and Shelford came to see me aboutthe case of WACE.

This f irm ivas known to thepolice since two people suspected of themurder of Lotte, the Crown witness in theHENNIG case, had disappeared in the vicinitysome time ago. The police there f redecided to raid the farm on the 14th.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/191$56The results of this.raid have not yet beenobtained.Felix takes the view that it is a good thingthat the case has been liquidated, as ne thithinks that by the time another transmitterhas been landed by submarine st Durban,the Mediterranean vill have been cleared,and the importance of S.Africa minimised.This struck everyone as being a somewhatspecious rgument.The D.G. has seen Duff about commissionerMood's and Mills's letters from Canada onthe relations bet een the R.C.M.P. andD.S.C. He has asked Duff to do his bestto effect a settlement at the earliestpossible moment. There appeirs to havebeen some feeling that ve, or rather Mills,had beennresponsible for Wood's letter.Duff was therefore shown Mills's personalletters to me vhich make the position quiteclear.March l8th-He havedecided to liquidate the TITTcase by sending him to Dartmoor. There isno doubt that he is confirmed liar, butit seems quite impossible to exatract romhim the real reason for his visit to thiscountry.

Wehad had 3 or 4 meetings and eich time hadbeen told that no final settlement couldbe reached until Stephenson returned. C. saidtat Stephenson was probably staying onon account of Eden's visit though neitherhe nor Duff could see what that had to dwith him. We had also been told that"inant was going to explore the positionand would be giving us his vies. He like-wise had not returned. Duf'f urged C.to press Stephenson to return forthwith.Meanwhile .said thit according to informatidthat he had received from Ne York thingswere nos going much better and thatwas an ungualified success ith the FBI.He had also beard from DickthatCatalogue aRaference;ko/41691 intend to resign.

He merely amounts tohis maintaining contact with certain sec-tions in this office, with Palmer and T-Rand with Section V. He would ho wever likeoccasionally to call a meeting of some ofthose concerned. He is not very sanguineabout the arrangement since we both feltthat there was a general lack of enthusiasmin S.J.

I said that I thoughtwe should discuss the matter With Dick andHart and then probaly with vivian.Frost has gone off with one of the B.5officers to try and clear upythe HOUSE case.Butler talked to me about the Home Officeappointment. The D.G. has suggested SirCharles Stead, who is a retired RegionalCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191Commissioner formerly Of the Punjab. Thisrather fills me with despair. He is 60 andI feel sure that a younger man is essential.If this job starts off on the wrong footthe whole arrangement will do us far moreharm than good. Hart thinks that the H.O.should appoint their own representative,with which I heartily agree. The difficultys.that they have no one available and ifwe press them they may give us a dud.I learn from Felix that Sir John Dashwoodis going out to Lisbon to look into the leaka-ages. He suggests that this will meet ourrequirements. I am not sure that it will, sisince any one going out there should have afull knowledge of what has transpired todate. Hart is going to find out on Mondaywhether Dashnood is to be fully briefedand whether he is to cover the ShippingOffice and if SO when he is likely to leave.Dick as Chairman of the R.S.I.C. has put upa memo compiled by the Service represen-tatives su esting a united ISOo index basedon that of Section V.provided the latteris brought to London. Such a move would behighly desirable, seeing that there are now7 separate organisations earding ESeS.Felix has sent a teleprinter message sayingthat the result it Of the raid in S.Africa aredisappointing but that he thinks this may bedue to Webster giving the information toCoetzee, whereas Muggeridge gave it to BastonItasks us to warn ebster not to give anyCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191161further information to Coetzee. I havepointed out that to give information to Bastoand withhold it from Coetzee is the equi-valent of asking Sir N.Kendal to carry outan S.B. job without informing Canning. I havhowever sent a telegram to Wepster warninghim that he must not make any use Of B.J.information communicated to him by Rydeuntil authority is given, as I thought itpossible that he might think that as theballoon had gone up he would be justifiedin doing SO.March 2lstMontague has informed J.C. about a Lisbon-Berlin message in which it is suggested thatan agent should put explosive or ineendiarycoal on board a ship on hich he is servingas steward. The agent is clearly Zigzagsince the message implies that he is identi-cal with the individual who did the Mosquitojob and that he cannot go back to England.He is to slip away as soon as the job isdone and go on to Paris. This all fits inwith ZigZag's set-up. The difficulty is toknow what appropriate action should be taken.I am trying to ascertain when the "City ofLancaster" is likely to leave Lisbon, sinceif there is sufficient time ve might sendan Officer out. L have also asked Fergieto put a rush on the Berlin-uisbon servicein order t at we might get a reply at theearliest possible moment. The message toBerlin was dated the 19th. Later I eardfrom Fergie that he was proposing to send aCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191wire to Jarvis iniorming him that Abt.iIwere proposin that Ligzag should sabotagehis ship, and asking him whether Zigzaghad informed the ship's captain. If not,without indicating the slightest knowledgeof the enterprise it was suggestedthatthe captin should be told to ask Zigzag(1) if a d when he was going to desert (2)whether he had contacted the Germans yetand if SO with what result, and 15) hadhe any messases for the capt in to takeback to England. At that moment Iwasdiscussing the whole problen with MontagueRonnie Reed J.C. and wilson. At first wethought that a telegram might be sent toJarvis explaining to him the position andsuggesting that he should arrange discreetlyfor the master to meet him at a suitablernedezvous for a purpose of arranging astill more discreet meeting bet een Jarvisand ZigZag, bearing in mind that the latterwas probably being folloved. Jarvis shouldshow ZigZag the signal from Foley and aythat he came with other instructions fromReed to asdertain whether Ligzag had success-fully contacted the Germans and if SO, whwhat instructions he had had at Lisbon. Onno account was Zigzag to be asked questionsabout about the sabotage. plan to Iine sabotage failed his to ship, come he cleanwould be placed in irons by the capsin andand brought back here. On further reflectionwe thought thatit would be better to sendReed who had daeeadvantage of knowing thewhole case and of knowing Zigzag persona ly.This would avoid the difficulty of Jarvis orCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191any of his people, who must be known to theGermans, making contact with Zigzag andwould have the additional advantage ofgiving Zigzag no way out. If he wereapproached by anyone else he might not feelunder any obligation to tell them a storywhich he thought he had already dealt within his own way. On the other hand however ifhe failed to disclose what had happened toReed we should have to assume that he wasdefinitely wrong. In any case we felt thatReed's presence in Lisbon could not be other-wise than a help to Jarvis.Eergie in consultation with Foley seemedto have some doubts about the necessity orindeed the advisability of Reed going outbut promised to let me have their decisionin the morning. Meanwhile the Germanreply dated 17.35 on 20.3.43 had come insaying that the plan devised by the Abwehrin Lisbon had been approved by headquarters.We also le arned from the Min.of War Trans-port that the ship is not likely to beunloaded before the 27th.I spoke to Fergie again at about 7 p.m.suggesting that ne should send off a wireto confirm the time of departureof the shipand ensure that as soon as igzag desertedthe matter should be reported. I had inmind that if he deseeted in the immediatefuture we should have to take a. more sinisterview of his part in the suggested enterprise.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/191March 22ndI rang up Cecil of the F.0. and arrangedabout Reed's Portuguese visa. He can ifnecessary carry a dummy bag. I also spoketo Fergie who said the matter was now inthe hands of Felix who was in conference.Later I rang again and was told that Felixhad left for London where he would be inconsultation with Vivian. I rang bothViv. and Felix and found they vere bothout. I left a message asking them toring up before they went to lunch whichthey failed to do.The second officers course began today.My remarkes were confined toexplaining thepurpose of the course and the necessity forsecrecy about our basic sources. I emphasis-ed that by no means everybody knew aboutthese sources in this office and stillless in offices outside. it was thereforeessential that before discussing themwithanyone else or outside, they shouldencuire whether the person was authorisedto know about such sources.I was not able to get hold of Felix at alltill 3 oclock. He was at first ratherreluctant to agree to Reed going to Lisbonand thought the telegram would do just aswell. I pointed out to him that unlessZigzag was confronted with Reed we shouldnever be quite certain wheier he wis rightor wrong. If he saw Reed he could have nopossible excuse for not telling him aboutCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191the suggested sabotage incident.I saidI thought that no trm could possibly be doneby sending Reed who knew the case and theman intimately. He and Jarvis could workout the best method of approach after hisarrival. Cowgill eventually agreed.I then rang Herbert and succeeded in gettinga place for Reed on tomorrow morning's plane.The D.G. called a conference of myseii, ilmoand Cookie to discuss the de GRAAF case.Cookie complained that he should have beencalled in the moment de GRAAF said that hehad been working for the German S.S. andmaintained that when he did spe k to deGRAAF he found him very easy. Milmo explainthat de GRAAF'S story hd only been extr ctedfrom him with considerable difficulty and bitby bit. Had he been interrogat ted in thefirst instance he would probably hve giventhe story that he relted at the LRC, Lythat he had worked for the Germans in orderto provide himself with me means of esc pe, indthat he had the pyramidon and the toothpicks for purely normal reasons. The D.P Eturned the case down bec use the formalstatement given to Cookie at a later stage hadbeen preceded by a number of other interro-gations. This might lay the prosecutionopen to attack on the grounds that thestory d.been extracted by third degreemethods. Personally I feel inclined toagree with Milmo that a weak statement inthe first instance folloed by interrogationsby M.I. and then another official st tementCataldgle Refereleetk4/T91ecutior open to theillcriticism that the original story was thetrue one and that the subsequent story had bebeen extracted under duress. My own viewis that if the case had been pressed withthe D.F.P. a successful prosecution mighthave ensued. it was agreed that wheneverthere was any doubt in the Cases of thissort in future there would be a consultation.Stamp and Milmo talked to me about thecase of WACE. It now transpires that WACEwas one of a party and when ne left Berlinhe as givena note to a man called MERCKEL whwas to meet the party at Metz. WACE and hiscompanions got out at Metz but could notfind MERCKEL The train went on andultimate-ly official was found who said thatMERCKEL had actually got on the train andgone on to Paris. The party proceeded bythe next train to Paris where they metMERCKEL who conducted them to Lisbon.Statements are being taken from other membersof the party.St.Johnson, the late C.C.Oxfordshire who isin charge of police matters in the officeof the C.C. .0. came to see me about thepart which we were going to play in thesecond front operations. 1 explained to himthe kind of duties that this office couldperform. He seemed to welcome the idea ofhaving a Security Officer at C.0.A.0.shead office. He is being assisted byInspector Suttling late of S.B.The P.M. made a very find speech on theCatalogue war and Reference:kV/4#P91 last night. There was167also an extract from the German broadcast ofHitler's speech on the occasion of HeroesDay. His voice was on a very Ow,monotonoustone. While most people seem to think itwas his voice, he certainly did not seem tobe up to his usual form. We have got thetranseript of the broadcast, which gieshis conversation With wounded soldiers.They never amounted to more than an announce-ment of the man's name, his wounds and theplace where he was ounded. Hitlers repliedin each case consisted merely of a repetitionof the name of the place where the man waswounded. He seemed to show no emotion andasked no question.The Tunisian offensive started on Friday nighand seems to be going well.The D.G. has approved the appointment ofWethered to look into S.0.E. and S.1.S.penetration cases.March23rdDick is extremely incensed with Felix fortorpedoing the suggestion put forward by theR.S.I.C. The committee, after due consid-eration of all the facts said that theythought that Merko ROT'S statement about theSofia Meldekopf and the Max and Moritzservices should be handed to the Russianson the grounds that if the Max and Moritzservices were a true bill the Russiansshould be informed about the man in theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19116Soviet Embassy in Sofia who was acting as a ttraitor, or that if Max and Moritz were doublcross, they could warn the Russians as tothe true facts. This minute of the committeewas sent to C. for his decision. C. referredit, to Felix who said that he was satisfiedthat the Moritz traffic was obtained frominterception of our signals and Russiansignals and that the W.O. were in fullagreement with this view. In fact thismatter has been thrashed out months agoand the bulk of the evidence seems to bein the contrary sense. Moreover Mellandsays that the W.0. are by no means satisfiedthat Moritz is not a double-cross. SectionV. have a representative on the committee whoagreed to the resolution put forward andHudsom Williams of Section V who wasmost concerned entirely disagrees withFelix's view. In any case an impossiblesituation has been reached if the committee'sviews are to be torpedoed by Felix who reallydoes not know what he is talking about.At the D.G.S meeting today Jim Hale told usabout his meeting with the H.O. about theFrench interrog ition centre at Duke St.where somewhat irregular methods are employedIt was decided that Newsam would advise theHome Secretary not to register any protestin view of possible adjustments which will bemade if there is an amalgamation of theforces of de Gaulle and Giraud. Newsamwas a little offensive in suggesting thatwe might possibly have instigated the Frenchto use improper methods.

M.E.W relating to conditions in WesternEurope, and in particular to collaboration-ists. I discussed the case vith Cussen. Weagreed that there would be no point in try.ingtoget the paper suppressed since clearly theinformation could not really be held to bedetrimental to the war effort. On the otherhand there was a definite leakage and itould be interesting to know who had disclos-ed the matter to the Press. Cussen suggestedthat M.O.I. should be asked to send for theeditor.E dined with C.Lancs nd put him more orless in the picture.March 24thA piece of the parachute by me ins of whichMutt and Jeff's wireless set was droppedsome weeks ago has been picked up by afarmer near Loch Strathbeg. It only reachedus quite fortuitously through in officer inA.I.].g. having given it to Room 055. thegeneral instructions are that objeets of thiskind should be handed over to the Air Forceby the Police. I am going into this matterwith R.C. The officer's suspicions had beenaroused because of a report ne had read ofan interrogat tion of a. German airman whoclaimed to have landed an agent here in Nov.1939 in a Dornier 18 off the Yorkshire coastnot far from Searborough. this agent wasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19111-equipped with a short-wave W/T set. At theend of April 1940 e picked upthe same manfrom a bay just tothe North of lamboroughHead. This spy Was said to have given theGermans immensely valuable informationat the beginning of the Norwegiar campaignand also about a raid carried out in April1940, on which advance inform tion was given.There was a raid on April lOth from which5 Hampdens and 2 Wellingtons ailed to re-turn from a flight to southern Norway.The signal for picking up a spy was to be thedropping of a bomb, and thas a bomb had beendropped in connection ith the Mutt and Jefienterpriset the Air Force officer who broughtin the bit of parachute thought it mighthave some significance from an M. I.5 pointof view. he P/WW also spoke of anotheragent that he had landed at the beginningof the French campaign. This man wore civil-ian clothes and was provided with a Sg. Leaderuniform and a small transmitter: wandingsfrom aircraft and also descents by parachuteshad later gone out of fashion as they wereth ught to be too d ingerous.There has been a further development in theWACE case through the identification ofMERCKEL on the ISOS and through certaindiscrepancies in TACE'S story when comparedwith that of one of his fellpw-travellers.The ISOS shows that MERCKEL went from cologneto making Lisbon this at journey. the same MERCKEL time that is WACE a man was whohas been formerly associated with otherCatafoguesreterence:kvi4/99193At the Wednesday meeting Grogan mentioned thatfour plain code letters compiled by S.0.E.had been inserted in the mails.

They havesince been show to Foyer. ile has tried hishand at one but seems to be on the wrong tackIt is not thought that he ould be able tomake much of the others under about months.From this it would seem that these coees,which are quite simple to memorise, would befar safer than secret ink. e have no evi-dence that the Germans are making extensiveuse of such codes. I sincerely hope theywill stick to secret ink and duff.An ISOS message shows th t Zigzag will beleaving for Paris via Madrid on the night ofthe 2oth. It is to be hoped that Reed willhave been able to make contactnith him.Hollis came to talk to me about a man calledChandler MORRIS of the American Embassy who seseems to have afriend called Carlo employedin what is known as the Prevention Divisionof the 0.S.S. On introduction from CarloMORRIS paid a visit to the C.P. There areobvious difficulties in passing this informa-tion to the Americans without disclosing thesource. We finally came to the conclusionthat the best method would be for the StateDept. to have MORRIS up and ask him what hewas doing when he visited the C.P. in London.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/191uHe may then say that he went in the introduc-tion of a man called Carlo. If so, this willenable the authorities to make furtherenquiries about Carlo. If on the other handthere is no disclosure about Carlo we couldat a later date consider passing informationabout him to O.S.S.I discussed with Victor action regardingthe Zigzag affair if Reed is unable tomake contact. We Came to the conclusionthat the onlything to do would be to pickover each piece of coal before it is putinto the furnace.The D.( sent forMme about the suggestionto put a liaison officer in the H.O. Heshowed me a reference in Who's Who to sirCampbell Ker, formerly an Indian CivilServant, who he thought would be suitablefor the appointment; My heart sank when Isaw that he was born in 1878. I told theD.G. that as a result of conversations 1had had with Jennifer Hart and Toby MathewE was was strongly of opinion that if wecould induce the n.0. to appoint theirown representative from their own staff suenan arrangement would be far morebeneficialto this office. They felt that anybody ap-pointed by us might be regarded as suspect.The D.G. said that Sir Campbell Ker knewour work from A to Z. but asyfar as L can seehis sole qualification was thit he had hadsomething to do in the past with communismin the Punjab. I Said that 1 thought who-ever did this job would have to make up hisCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19175to a good deal of intensive work in thisoffice before he was qualified to carryout his job. In spite of wh it I said theD.G. replied that he would be seeing Maxwelltomorrow and that there would be no h rm inhis mentioning the n ime. I spoke to TobyMathew on the phone and asked him whetherhe had found any suitable person to fill theposition. He said that SO far he had not butthat he would spe k to Maxwell and urge uponhim the importance of giving US an 11.U.official. He did not think that anybody fromthe Indian police was likely to be particuaar-ly acceptable to the H.0. since they had hadsomewhat unfortunate experiences with someof the Regional Inspectors.March 25thThere has been another ISOS meesage indicatingthat. Zigzag went to Madrid on the 23rd, leavesfor Hendaye on the 26th and will be in Parison the morning of the 28th. I am afriadthat this means that Reed must have missedhim. ie have drafted a telegram to the NCSOtelling him that Reed will be getting intotouch with him regarding proposed anti-sabot-age action. Te also drafted a telegram whichL read over to Eerguson suggesting that itshould be sent to Jarvis for Reed. After giviZigzags movements, enquiries are made as towhether Zigzag said anything to the capti in, awhat the present position is. If Zigzag has mmade no disclosure Reed is to suggestithefollowing action to the NCSO: examinationof the coal between the bunker and boilerCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19116immediately the ship leaves. the coal isexplosive but will not detonate unless throwninto the furnace or violently handled.I am considering the re-opening of the deGRAAF case on the grounds that it is highlyimportant for general security reasons tostage a sabotage trial. Otherwise it isdifficult to keep factories and vulnerablepoints up to the mark.Stamp has had a long convers tion with WACEas the result of which he does not think thatMERCKEL is identical with the ISOS character.The descrictions do not tally. The caseagainst WACE thenefore seems to collapse.Commander Wynn came to see me. He is goingout to take Hasting's place in Washington.I explained to him about our difficultiesin showing B.J.S to Thurston and suggestedto him that he should see Vivian.Dan has just telegraphedto say that theStephen Carrol HELD cypher has been brokenand it may be identic l with the one beingused by GOERTZ. Messages that we haveobtained in Lisbon have been exmined andappear to be in the nandwriting of ANDREWS.ANDRENS met EASTWOOD on arrival and therewas an exchange of notes. A cypher has beenfound in GOERTZ'S cell, probably throughthe assistance of his servant who is in Dan'semploy. Dan has asked us to send over anexpert to look at the cypher. Page and Cecilwill probably be going over on Saturday.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19177Dick, Curry and I talked about the future ofResearch. We all agreed that the most profitable line would be for the continu tion ofCurry's book to comprise certain definite ttrends that should be treated on a specialbasis e.g. the extent to which the S.D. ispenetrating the Abwehr. In order to get aline on these various trends Curry shouldsee representatives of the various depart-ments concerned and perhaps C 11a meetingperiodically. It was suggested that he shoulddiscuss this with VivianThe D.G. asked me about certain visitors fromO.N.I. It seems that O.N.I. are spreadingtheir tentacles rather wide and want tocome into the field of C.E. I suggested thatwe should as far as possible confine themto the functions that would normally beperformed by an S.0.I. If they come cherethey should visit dam Cheney, the ports andpossibly the L.R.C.March 26thTwo telegrams have at last arrived from Reed.He has seen the captain Who stated th t hehad been approached by Zigzag, but that inview of his instructions he ould not havesaid anything to anyone except Reed. Thesabotage project was suggested to the Germansby ZigZag. He had obtained a bomb which theCapt in had in his safe. Reed would bringbt back by air. He suggests that we shouldstage some sabotage incident when the boatgets back to Liverpool. Victor, in conjune-Catalogue tion jueReference:kvian1epyi to devise some17%means of doing this without causing damage tothe ship.Frost came to see me firstly about theHOUSE case which has been liquidated, withthe help of Skardon. HOUSE explained thewireless apparatus by saying that he wantedto get extremely good reception. This is aplausible excuse. The house in which heresides with his father is very large.He only uses about tho rooms which are inan extremely dirty condition, and has noservants. There is no doubt that IOUSE is acrook. He ither does not know quite whataction to take to recover his money. HOUSElied on a few rather immaterial points.The case is not considered either by Frost orSkardon to be of any security interest.As regards signals security, Frost he rtilydis ipproves of G-P's del ying tactics. Hethinks that- ve should be wrong if did notbring the present sitution to the noticeof the Chiefs ofStaff since operations may beendangered. There appears to be a good de lof factual evidence obt ined during therecent exercises. I have asked Frost toput upa note about this, when I propose totake the matter uo again with the .G.,makingthe suggestion that the subject should bediscussed at the Radio Security Committee.Harry talked to me about the Second Front.He said that Mountain and Vale vere going dowrto Glenalmond next veek. Harry proposes togo with them. Their idea is to discoverCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191179exactly what Section V. can offer.L sidthat they could only offer 5 things. (1) toact as a conduit-pipe for ISO S;( (2) toproduce before the I.b. staff a certainnumber of n mes of suspects of the area,which to some extent ould be collectedfrom the RPS; and (3) to start runningagents, butfor this they ould have verylittle experience. There was in factnothing that they proposed to do that wecould not do with a great deal more experienceOn the other hand there were m any thingswhich we did which they had never touched itall. They have not yet begun to train theirofficers and they did not propese to givethem morethan 3 weeks training before sendingthem out. For the services of these officersthey will indent upon the Army. the wholebusiness seems to me quite farcical.The D.u has turned do n the idea of bringingMaunsell under this office, although Dickhas sicceeded in persuading him that thereis nothing which cuts across our presentcharter and that he should not thereforesay nything that might bind his successorafter the var.I sa Cavendish-Bentinck to discuss with himthe difficulty of G.2's objection to ourshowing B.J.S to Thurston. Cavendish-Ben-tinck thought the only ne nay to handle thismatter would be for the D.M.I. to write apersonal letter to Strong explaining to himthe difficulties.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/191cfMarch 27thI had a long talk with Burt about theHOYSE case. He thinks the case is fairlycomplete. He was disappointed thatSir Frank Sprigg who will not give acategorical tatement that he warned theAir Ministry, merely says that he toldARMSTRONG there was some sort of enquirygoing on about the particular contract.Thecase has gone to the.D.P.Pand it illbe for the jury to decide whether or notthere was corrupt practice.I discussed the de GRAAF case with Burt.He agrees with my view thatinterrogation atthe early stages would have been a mistakeHe says that even in criminal cases henever takes a st tement until he is prettycertain what the man in is going to say.Burt also told me about the Vine St.inspector who is taking over the positionof Commandant at the LRC. Apparentlythis is a matter of some comment in Yardcircles, and has caused remarks tobe made to the detriment of this department.I think the inference is that the placehas been somewhat mismanaged, aind that itneeds a Yard man to put things right.Evidently Moyland and Kendal have been hob-nobbing together. Burt I think hasdistinct reservations about InspectorRobinson but exactly what they are L havenot yet discovered.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/191(%1I spoke to Skardon about the O'BRIENcase. Last November a letter was seenin Censorship going to one John O'BRIENat an address in Dublin, and signed"your fond brother Syd", from an addressin Cowes. Scrutiny showed that a secondsheet of paper had been gummed to thecovering letter, and contained in badGerman certain information about themilitary and civil situation on the I.0.W.Although the letter was written in goodEnglish, certain points about it, such asthe date written as "Novembre" and thefigures and word "Nieuport" in the enclosurmade it uncertain whether "Syd" was notperhaps an alien. Enquiries have beenmade both in I.0.W. and Dublin with noeffect. Skardon said that his min diffi-culty had been in dealing at third handthrough the RSLO and the local police.I said that E was reluctant to teave thecase as it was and have asked him to takeit up personally on the spot. I thoughtthat possibly the most practical line ofenquiry would be toediscover somethingabout the Belgian Nave personnel in theI.0.1 talked with Cussen about the M.E.N.eWgReview leakage case. Farrer, who haswritten to me, evidently thinks therehas been leakage in high quarters. Inasking Ratcliffe of the .0.1. to help uswith the editor, I think we shouldimpress upon him that although the itemswere passed by censorship and in themselvesCatalogue Refererfce.kv4n19f to national securityit might be inferred that as the informationabout the publication of these econd Frontbooks had leaked out, something mighth ve been said about the orderin which theyhad been done. If information has leaked,and priority was givento any particularcountry it would be a serious matter.Reed has rung up to say that he is inBristol. He says that he Captiin ofthe ship had been interrogated 4 timesby the shipping office and had deniedthat he knew anything about the ZigZagaffair. He effected to be extremelyannoye that an agent had been put on hisboat without his knowledge He was infact acting on strict instructions thathe was not to divulge the fact of Zigzag'connection with the British Intelligence.He was much relieved to see Reed. Thepiece of coal has been sent round via Gib.as Jarvis was nervous about its beingtaken on the aircraft in case it had somedelay mechanism.March 29thI saw Dick, Victor, T.A.R. and Reed aboutthe ZigZag case. It seems that the Captairhas played his part well. He even instruc-ted Zigzag to cause trouble on the ship.Zigzag threatened to attack one of theother stewards with a knife, and the inci-dent ended in a brawl, and the steward waslaid out. We discussed whether a fakeexplosion should take place at Gib. orCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191163Liverpool. There is an advantagein doingit at Gib. since the information couldeasily leak back to the Germans. On theother hand this is a disadvantage inthat since certain people, members of thecrew and possibly others, might have tobe in the know, the fact that the explo-sion was a fake might get back too easilyto the Germans. We eventually decided totake no action in Gib. and ork out somescheme which can be put into operationas soon as the ship re ches Liverpool.The piece of coal was notionally placedon some spot where it would hot be throwninto the boilers until the ship was wellout to sea. ZigZag has explained this tothe Germans. Our methods of communicationwith him now are by code advertisementsin the Times and through practice messageswhich he hopes to be able to send fromParis to ivantes.Milmo came to see me about the WITT case.He had a letter from Duff Cooper askingabout the guarantees to WITTS wife. Heis replying that WITT has confessed thateverything he said about his proposedmission to this country was a lle. wedid not consider therefore that SOE hadany further obligation to the wife.Cooper of the Nigerian Police came tosee me.. He told me about the exploitsof Supt.Ward, who for the last 3 yearshas been in constant contact with MANETTE,the Chief of Police in Dahomey. He hadCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191ieualways had good personal relations withMANETTE, and on a strictly personal basisthese had continued even after the Frendhcollapse. Ward had in this way collecteda good deal of information. He had beenworking under the direction of SOE. Thisis a typical example of how S.0.E. cashin on the work of another organisationfor purely intelligence purposes. Theydid SO presumably because there was noother org isation in the field, and theresult has been quite profitable to allconcerned. Cooper is being taken roundby Gibbs and will be given such informationas he requires about secret inks. At oneof the camps in Nigeria there are quitea number of neutrals and Syrians, who havebeen working to Dahomey, it is thoughtin the interest of the Germans. None ofthese people however has been interrogatedin the proper sense of the word. It seemsa pity that we cannot get some of themback here.Senter came to see me aboutyril Harvey.He was anxious to obtain his servicesfor the C.E. section which S.0.E. aresetting up. I agree to the sugestion.I gather that Harvey is anxious to takeon the job. I also talked to Senter aboutCurry. I explained to him Curry's dis-abilities and also told him, about hisvirtues. I thought it a frightful pitythat one who had SO much knowledge and alsoability was being allowed to go to seed.He promised to consider him as soon asCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191i&sMarshal-Cornwall, who I think will ultimateltake Dansey' place, as got well into thesaddle in S.IS. Marshal-Cornwall is avery co-pperative person and I think anxiousto break down the various barriers which havbeen set up in the past.Vivian rang up to tell me that Stephensonhad arrived. He had heard that Strattonwas also in this country and was anxiousthat Stratton should be allowed to talkto "C". I gather that Stratton has alreadytalked with Howard. L said that I had notseen Stratton. I understood that he hadbeen ill since he nad arrived back, butthat he was expected in here today. Iwould mention the matter to the D.G. whoI was sure would be only too glad thatStratton should call on "Cn. L warned Viv.however that L should not be prepared toaccept all Stratton's viens about D.S.C.I thought he was a good fellow, but L didnot think his judgment was always as soundas it might be. Moreover he was very thickwith Connop Guthrie.Mocklet-Ferryman, late D..I. N.Africa,came to tell us about security matters inthat area. What interested us most was toascertain the exact functions of the S. I. (b)unit. He spoke in fairly glowing terms ofthe work they had done, his inf nformationbeing based on a report by Hill-Dillon.When we questioned him, he said that the S.(b) unit was the purveyor of most secretinformati n and also supplied informationCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191146about suspects, some accurate and someinaccurate. I (b) staff had in factrelied upon the French authorities who werewell disposed towards the allies. If therewas a case to be investigated it was theduty of the S.I.(b) officer to ask forsuch executive assistance as he requiredfrom the FSP. It was clear that neitherMockler-Ferryman nor Hill-Dillon reallyknew what expert C. C.1. advice Was. Therewas nobody to advice on counter-sabotageor to give full significance to informationfrom Mos Secret sources where acts ofsabotage were contemplated. There was noone with experience of interrogation orinvestigation. It seems that there wasa certain amount of trouble at Casablancawhere Park, one of the i.(b) officers,was accused by the Americans of being aBritish spy. He was refused permission tocommunicate either with Force Head uartersor with London and was eventually removed.Trevor-ilson is remaining as officer incharge of the S.I.

In anycase he will ask for its return. I toldhim that if it went to Desmond Morton itwas highly probable that he would take acopy and send it to "C". While there wasno real objection to this it might possiblycause a certain amount of troubleI also left with Duff a copy of DI irt'sreport on the Lisbon leakage case. Wethen talked about WITT. L explained thatthe idea th he should come to thiscountry had first been mooted by WITThimself after a conversation with Tennantthe Press Attache to whom he hadalreadysupplied certain articles of an anti-Nazicharacter for publication in this country.After a good de of diseussion here wehad f allen in with the view of S.0.E.that in any case WITT, who was considereda doubtful character, would be better inthis country than in Stockholm where ne wastrying to penetrate ourorganisations andsocial-democrat refugee circles. Furtherpoints were that WITTIS wife was nowemployed in Stockholm in a secretarialcapacity, and that he himself before hisarrest had been refused a visa by theSedish Authorities to return to Stockholm.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19146Lastly we had found WITT wholely unsatis-factory, and had at last extracted aconfession from him that the reasons hegave for coming to this country were entire-ly false. I think that as a result ofthis conversation Duff somewhat modifiedhis views about the whole case. He willprobably say a word to Selborne whenhe sees him.Duff showed me a commentary on a hugevolume which he described as "Stephenson'sapologia". the commentary had been madeby Diplock who seems to have reached moreor less the same conclusions as ourselves.These are th t Stephenenn was badlysupported by his own organisation and wasfor two years at Least kept very much inthe dark. He consequently lost credit withthe F.B.I. Secondly he made a gross blunderin not handing over att his agents toHoover when the Americans came into the war,and lastly his office is badly organisedand over-staffed. We are now awaitingC's decision as to Stephenson's ultimatefate. I told Duff that I thoughtStephenson had done a good deal of extremelyuseful work in the early days of the warbut that in the present situation I did notsee how he could continue as our repre-sentative, moreover anybody who representedS.I.S. in the present atmosphere would beregarded with some suspicion, firstlybecause he would be a member of an organ-isation known to carry out offensive opera-tions on foreign territory, and secondlyCatalogue Reference:KV/4/191
