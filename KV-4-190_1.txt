The plane cruised at about180 mph. The passage was bumpy untilwe got over the channel and bumpy againover the Irish coast. My fellowpassenger, the only lady in the party,was Commissioner Lamb's daughter who wasgoing out to see her father, who had beenreported as dying. (I saw her later at theChateau Laurier in Ottawa when shen toldme that he had had a miraculous recovery)There was a Customs officer at Rohannabut he did not seem interested in ourbaggage and confined himself to puttingchalk marks on it. We motored fromRohanna to Adare, where we found thatthe passengers who should have left 3days previously had gone halfway acrossthe Atlantic and then returned, apparentlyowing to bad conditions off NewfoundlandThere was a heavy gale blowing and ourprospects of getting away did not seem tobe very good. People were beginning towonder whether their tlo would last out.Later in the day the weather began toclear a little. I took a walk with otherpassengers in the grounds of Lord Dun-raven's estate. He apparently owns mostof the property in the vicinity. Itlooked as if there were some quite goodfishing to be got, and the country isof course characteristically beautiful.I was told that Dunraven was getting outCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190576his coach in order to run a coach servicebetween Foynes and Dublin, owing to petrolshortage- He had advertised for a man toblow a horn but So far had not succeededin finding one.The proprietress of the hotel, which wasquite comfortable, struck me as beinga little odd. I rather thought sne haua German accent. I heard later inNew York that a member of one of theClipper crews had lost his papers at thehotel and that a maid had been suspectedof going through his pockets, but Ido not expect there was nything in it.As all the passengers were Government offiofficials it would be quite easyto pickup some interesting information. Thepassengers consisted of a group ofsteel experts, a director of B.O.A.C., anAmerican called Winner who was Donovan'slink in London with P.W.E., a Mr.Gellwho was going out for Korda on propagandafilms, a rather unpleasant type I thought.Hutton of the Min. of Food, a Free Freeman on his way to W.Africa and a numberof others whose names I cannot remembercompleted the party. There were in allabout 19.We left Adare by car for Foynes after8 o.m. and took off about 10 p.m. TheClipper was an extremely luxurious ship.At its broadest point it was possiblefor 2 people to lie full length witha passage in between. the interior wasvery well fitted up with convertible searsCatalogue Referenge:k/4tl9he into bunks. The577plane carried a crew of akort 9. Thecraft weighs 42 tons, has a cruisingspeed of 135 mph and a maximum speedof 175. It takes off the water at 95 mph.It has four 2,000 h.p. engines, withfacilities for carrying out repairs inflight. It can proceed on two engineswithout losing height. There was afair wind blowing and clouds were ratherlow. The first fe hours we were flyingabout 5-600 ft. This was mainly forthe purpose of economising in petrol.Later dyring the night after we hadgot rid of a certain amount of our weightin petrol, we climbed to 8,000 ft. wherewe stayed for the rest of the trip.We were carrying enough petrol to giveus 5 jours flying over the normal amountrequired. In addition to the sleepingcompartments, the plane has dining roomand kitchen. Breakfast was served in theearly hours, orange juice, bacon and eggs,etc. When some distance from Newfoundlandwe passed over an icefield. The icebergswere clearly visible well below thesurface.May May27th 27thWe landed at about 7.15 American timeat Botwood after 14 hours flight. Botwoodis more or less in the making and morein the nature of a camp than a town. Theweather was misty and there was some slighdifficulty in finding our way down throughthe clouds. We were taken up to a shackwhere we were given more bacon and eggs,We offered to pay in British money, butCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190519the natives said they could only acceptCanadian or American dollars. We pointedout that there would be people goingback and forth on this route and thatthey might do quite a useful businessin exchange. They eventually saw thepoint and took our money. We took offagain at about 10.45. The usual formis to taxi out over the course in orderto see that there are no obstacles andthen after revving up all four enginesyou skim across the water until therequisite speed of 95 mph is reached.Tt is I gather sometimes difficult toget away if the water is too smooth enaccount of the suction.We arrived at Shediack, Nova Scotia, at3.50 New York time, picked up some mail, 1left at 4.30, and arrived in New Yorkopposite wa Guardia field at .30.I had some difficulty with my documentsas I was not carrying an official pass.I pleaded ignorance of the regulationsand was eventually let through. I go(to my hotel, the Carlyle on 76th andMadison, at 10.15.May 28thI rang up Stephenson's office. Stephensonwas away but Pepper came down to the hoteland took me up to 630 5th Avenue, wherethe S. and S.Q.E. offices are situatedon the 35th and 36th floors. sawStephenson later in the day and wasintroduced to Wren and others.I spentCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/190579the next few days talking with Wrenand looking at various files. Wren hasin his section Gavin Young, a Canadianwho is more or less new to the game,Ronnie Sinclaip, Mrs. Silverston (SylvanusVivian's daughter), Mrs. Montagu, thewife of Ewen Montague of N.I.D., andone other lady whose name I forget. Bavinof the R.C.M.P. who has a seat in thedown-town office is by way of effectingliaison with the F.B.I. and with theR.C.M.P., but his work seems to beconcerned more with security matters thanwith counter-espionage. It was quiteclear to me that Wren was very muchin the dark about what we were all ryingto do and what we knew about the GermanIntelligence Services, and that this madehis position vis-a-vis the F.B.I. verydifficult. He got questions of one kindor another from home but he was rarelytold what was behind them.May 31stI went down to Long Island where I sawMargaret Barry, who is looking after 19English children in a typical old-timeLong Island house with wonderful gardensand grounds. I met there two Britishnaval officers, one who had been on thePrince of Wales when she was sunk and hadafterwards got away from Singapore. He nowwas waiting for a ship. The realtrouble I gather in regard to the P.O.W.was no fighter protection and lack ofcooperation between Navy ind AirForce.Catalogue Reference:KV4/19060The Japs torpedo-bombers were extremelygood. They came right down low andfired their torpedoes at a distance of1,000-500 yards. It was impossible tosay how many were over the ship but in allsomething like 40 or 50. In the firstattack the shaft was bent. This resultedin the works being thoroughly churnedup inside and a heavy list. Beforeshe sank she had 19 torpedoes in her.The officer did not think there wasany thing to complain of in the construc-tion. What they were really up againstwas lack of fighter defence and thevery great efficiency of the bombing.He gave a frightful account ofSingaporeand the behaviour of the Australians.The English and Scottish egimentsfought magnificently but the Australiansjust packed up. There were many desertersin large numbers from the rank of Captaindownwards and they fought their way on toany ships they could find. Some of themare said to have been shot in Java forcowardice.The other N.O. was trying to give someassistance to the Naval authorities onthe question of anti-submarin warfare.The sinkings in the Caribbean have beenappalling. He said that he had given allthe necessary advice two years beforeand had warned the Americans about theCaribbean. They had reg irded such a thingas impossible and had taken no precautionsThey had however had the generosity tosay that they wished they had taken arecord of what he had said 2 years ago,Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19058since everything he had predicted hadmore or less come to pass.June 2ndI visited the down-town office. ConnopGuthrie, who is more or less head ofthis office, was away. Nelson, his secondin command, was in charge. Nelson isan extremely likeable fellow but strikesone as being somewhat of an intellectual.He belongs to the publishing family,but has for some years been running afarm in Wyoming. He gave me the generallay-out of the office. Bates is incharge of the Consular Security officersin U.S.A. and Karri-Davies of those inS. America. Formerly the office hadhad a good deal to do with the securityof armaments being manuf ctured by theBritish while they were in transit tothe port of embarkation. This work had nOWbeen transferred to the American authoritieand the personnel had been transferred toWashington where they were doing workfor the Australin Purchasing Commission.There had also been a Fire ProtectionSquad who had been engaged in lookingafter goods awaiting shipment. Thissquad had also been disbanded and the workhanded over to the F.B.I. Liaison withthe F.B.I., the State Policeand theR.C.M.P. R. were in the hands yof Bavin.I had a talk with Karri-Davies. He wasyery keen to get any material from us onthe question Of sabotage particularlymaterial which he could transmit toCatalogtrenReference.kVt4n19o He saidthat anything we could tell them aboutGerman methods would be invaluable. Hehad seen the X-ray photographs and dia-grams of infernal machines.Communist activities are handled by.P.Evans, although it would seem thatthis should be an appropriate jobunder Wren who would pass the informationto Section V. and SO to ourselves. Thesubject has up to now been handled bythe Security Division probably on accountof labour disturbances, which affectedthe production and transit of armamentsafter manufacture for the U.K. Evansstruck me as being intelligent andconsientious. He is making quite a studyof the subject and getting hold of somequite useful material both through hisliaison with the Americans and Canadians,through Censorship and through the Press.He clearly needed guidance and I did mybest to impress upon him that informationwhich illustrated the control and policeof the Comintern was of greater interetthan strike disturbances due solely toeconomic causes. We were particularlyinterested in directives from Moscow,methoof communication, funds, etc. sinceAmerica was one of the few places wheredata was available for comparisonwith that received at home.He showed me some correspondence betweenMarcel PIVERT in S. American or Mexico,and Fenner BROCKWAY and John MCNEIL ofGlasgow. These letters had been obtainedCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190563in Censorship and Evans wondered whetherwe had seen them. He also showed mea general report on communism in Americawhich was sent in last March. I do notknow if we have had it.Babette GROSS, Willi MUNZENBERG'Smistress, is apparently now in Mexicoand a certain amount of her correspond-ence has been intercepted. Othercorres ondence which Evans thoughtwould interest us was that passingbetween Apartado 8620, Mexico, which Igather is the Central Catalan pyndioate,to one Carlos PI-SUNYER, 22 WendoverCourt, Finchley Rd. Rd.N.CW.2. N. CW. 2.If Evans wishes to make enquiries inS. America he passes them through Section3 of the p-town office. For matters inN.America he relies upon his liaison iththe F.B.I and others. He had been muchinterested in the report on the ShopStewards Movement in this country, a copyof which he had given to the F.B.I.who were also deeply impressed. He saidit would be of great assistance to himto receive any memoranda of this kind or aany reports on communist activities herewith which he could bargain with hisopposite numbers. Even if the reportscannot be passed on, he would be veryglad to have them himself as they wouldassist him considerably in his work.As regards Communist literature I saidthat we should be glad to receive anypapers or periodicals which containedCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1906%uarticles denoting some new feature ofthe movement, and that we should begrateful if he would, when forwardingthem, arrange that they be suitablymarked. He undertook to let us have anyinformation about the formation of anynew communist or pseudo-oommunistorganisation.Down-town is responsible for the vettiof personnel employed by the PurchasingCommission and other British Missionsand also for the vetting of the personnelof allied forces recruited in the WesternHemisphere.I had a talk with Madement, R.S.S.representative at the up-town office.He told me that there had recently beena conference known as the WilkinsonConference at which certain vagueprinciples had been laid down on thesubject of monitoring and cryptography.Monitoring must be done by.the FederalCommunications Committee, Army and Navincluding Coastguards, cryptography threeonly being done by the Army,Navy andF.B.I. No very definite decision wasarrived at about distribution exceptthat aall decyphered material was to go to theState Dept. In the matter of cryptographythere is a complete barrier between theservices and the F.B.I. The Personnelemployed by the F.B.I. is not of a veryhigh grade and they have no experience.They are however trying to build up ahuge organisation.

They are therefore trying tocrack up the Jap cypher, which is alreadydealt with by the Navy. Our policy inthe past has been to keep in touch withall organisations on the understandingthat we do not pass anything from oneto the other. The F.B.I. are apparentlysetting up some organisation on thePacific coast both for monitoring and de-cyphering. No diplomatic traffic isapparently sent to Security Co-Ordinationgot from a England. certain amount Stephenson of Jap it B.J.s is believed fromthe Americans. Madement said that as faras he knew there was no illicittraffic from the Argentine to Euvope butthere was of course cable communicationwhich was used freely by the Germans. Hethought that there was a cable whichformerly ran to Gib and then to N. Africabut that it had been cut at Gib. Unfortun-ately S.I.S. were extremely weak in theArgentine. Up to a week or SO ago theyhad no one. It was obviously highlydesirable that somebody should be gotinto the postoffice at B.A. in order tocollect all diplomatic cables to Europe,particularly since it is the policy ofthe F.B.I. to get S.

The Americans seemto have a mania for diagrams, many ofwhich I fear are quite meaningless ifnot misleading. I was shown a map ofthe United States. Superimposed on thiswere two talc covers. On one of thecovers the areas where enemy aliens wereconcentrated were painted in colour, andon the other the big industrial centres.It was thought remarkable that the alienpopulation should correspond almostexactly with the industrial centres.I was told that the Chiefs of Staff hadbeen much impressed. Personally I wasunable to anderstand why any significshould be attached to the identity oflocation. I came to the conclusion thatall this vast mise-en-scene was notdesigned SO much to impress the visitoras to impress the gentleman who occupiedthe room of his own importance.

This is extremely cum-bersome and only successful if concreteevidence could be obtained. "ithoutany prompting Tamm said that he had beenamazed that there had been no act ofsabotage committed in the United Stateswhich could be definitely traced to enemyagency, and that all the cases ofespionage which had come to their noticehad been of an extremely crude variety.So crude were they that he wondered verymuch whether they had not been faked topull the wool over the eyes of the F.B.I.I told him that our experience had beenvery similar and that the same doubtshad arisen in our minds. We were howeverfairly satisfied that the Germanshad not got an extensive organisationin the U.K. and that such cases as hadcome to our notice were genuine cases.The German machine was well conceived andwell planned but it seemedyto vary verymuch in efficiency when it came to action.I went on to see Carson, a young and verykeen officer who is responsible for esp-Catalogue atalogunReferentce.kt4ngo S. .America.

A difficulty had arisenabout deportees from S. .America. theState Dept. had given an undertaking to ththe S. american states to send them backto Europe in exchange for the nationalsof the countries from which they came.The F.B.I. were anxious to hold allthose who were connected with the GermanIntelligence Service, and were in conflictwith the State Dept. about this matter.They hope that we should be able to dosomething through the British Embassy tostrengthen their hands. The SpanishConsul General in the U.S. was undergrave suspicion. Information had beenreceived that he was using the diplomaticbag for improper purposes and recentlyhe had had his bag opened under his owneyes. Unfortunately nothing was found.The incident however passed off withoutprotest. The F.B.I. are very perturbedabout the sinkings in the Caribbean. Theysay there is no doubt that the Germanshave extremely accurate informationabout the movement of ships. They wonderhow this information is conveye ed to sub -marines, which seem to known in the great-est detail the name of ship, ,captain, andall about the cargo. I imagine they getthis information wirelessed back andit then goes out to the submarines by ZPTbut I could not of course tell the Americarabout this.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/190THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINED$8IN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORACT 1958.June 4thI saw Ladd of the F.B.I. and was againaccompanied byLaddis a Middle Westerner and a stickypersonality. He is virtually in chargeof all the practical side of espionageactivities. I handed over to him detailsof a number of cases which we had had inthe U.K. > also data about secret ink andcertain codes. He seemed pleased withthis information, but it soon transpired tthat he had a strong suspicion thatwe had been holding up on him in the past,and he mentioned the incident of thebombing of Tokyo. We had made a sugges-tion that the Mosquera transmitter shouldbe used for intimating to the Germansthat Ickyo would be bombed. The ideawas to try and draw off planes and air-craft carriers from Burma and theIndian Ocean. By a pure coincidence Tokyowas bombed three days later. Ladd wonder-ed first of all how we knew about this,whether there had been any leakage, and wawas disinclined to believe us when wesaid we had no prior knowledge of thematter. He then asked who, if thisinformation was false, we had indicatedthat we would prefer that it went overfrom the Mosquera transmitter rather thanthe one used by Tricycle. We explainedthat Tricycle was at the moment inrather a delicate position. Ladd wasnot very inclined to accept this informa-tion particularly as we h d told him thatCatalogiie eferehteaVA4Agoformation Agonformation that wasin this case we had no knowledgeTHIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINED5a0IN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3(4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958 Ou OODof the fact that the information Was true.He thought therefore that we were ryingto pass off a piece of dud information onMosquera which would have jeopardised hisposition. We pointed out that themessage was SO worded as to leave Mos-quera plenty of loopholes, since it hadnot been worded in definite terms.Ladd then went on tocemplain that hewas asked to make enquiries withoutbeing told the reason. I entirelyagreed with him that this was undesirableand that in future we should do our bestto give him the fullest possible back-ground. I explained to him that wedid not wish to pry into american affairsbut that we were anxious to exchangeinformation on the broadest possiblebais particularly with regard to theproeedure of German agents and datarelating to German intelligence organisa-tions and personnel. Ladd told methat as far as he knew no duff was goingfrom the U.S. He also said that he hadhad no cases of espionage by Italians.The case of Tricycle was discussed.Ladd complained that he had na yetreceived Balloon's traffic which had beenpromised. I said that it was on its wayand that we should keep him fully informedin future. We in return should beinterested to see the Mosquera traffic.I feferred to the case of KELLER andSTAHLDER, the two individuals who hadcome from Gib. with plans and photographsand had been arrested in the U.S.asked whether we might be given facilitiesCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19059(for interviewing these men. Ladd promisedto do what he could.I then went to see Kramer and Kimbell,two of Ladds subordinates. Kramer toldme afterwards that he was of pure Germandescent and that his grandfather wasin the Kaiser's bodyguard. There is nodoubt however that he is 100% Americanin sympathy. I explained to them boththe workings of the Twenty Committeeand the XX agent system. they wereenthusiastic, particularly Kimbell whowas very quuick to see all the implica-tions, and the necessity for getting theco-peration of the Service Depts. Theyintended to put the idea to higher author-ity. They said that a careful search ofNIKOLAUS'S belongings had revealedmicro-films contained in the toe of hisboot. These films were of the latestAmerican submarine escape device.NIKOLAUS did not know at the moment thatthis had been found. The F.B.I. wereparticularly pleased as they thought itwould strengthen ther hand in dealingwith the State Dept. in the matter of thedetention of enemy aliens from S, Americawho had been connected with the Germanintelligence system.I lunched with Asst. ommissioner Brucewho is the R.C.M.P. liaisor officer withthe F.B.I. I asked him to tell me quitefrankly what the F.B.I. thought about us.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/190savHe said "If you really want to know, theythink you are too cagey and that you arehdding up on them". I told him thatI thought that in many ways they werequite right and one of my preoccupati ionswould be to get things loosened up.He said that he wholly trusted the F.B.I.and that they had always given CommissioneWood the fullest co-operation. I gatherthat Bruce is allowed to see the F.B.Ifiles. I asked him how the suggestionthat we also should have a representativein the F.B.I. would be likely to bereceived. He said that it was difficultto say but that he thought such asuggestion might quite possibly beacceptable. He emphasised that the F.B.I.particularly bisliked being asked tomake enquiries without being given fullfacts. Bruce was very anxious that Ishould treat what he had told me asstrictly confidential and that I shouldmake no use of his name.In the afternoon I rang up John Maude.I subsequently went out to see him atthe Embassy. He told me the wholestory of his career in America. He seemedto think that he had been badly treatedand he had quite made up his mind tocome back to England. Stratton hadsuggested to him that he might like totake over the D.S.O.'s job yin BritishHonudras, but he was evidently sick ofthe whole business and anxious to getback. He said that anybody could do thejob of looking after the security ofCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION5933 (4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958 Oc 0o0Missions and that he could not go ondrawing a large salary for whatreallywas a very small job. Personally I thinthat he has had rather a raw deal. Hefell foul of Ingram Fraser, which is notsurprising, and somehow incurred thedispleasure of Stephenson, and thereforenever had a chance of dealing with enquiri-es which affected out office. I donot think he got on very well withStratton or with Dick Ellis, who aredepartmentally quite different people.John seemed to think that he went downvery well with the Americans and that hehad done a good job as far as he hadbeen allowed. Other people however seemto regard him rather as superficial andrather a joke. He is going back withoutany stink but is I think clearly adisappointed man.and I dined with Carson ofthe F.B.I. We had a long discussion aboutour Nork and methods. Carson was veryunderstanding and very keen to learn.He would very much like to pay us a visit.June 5thI went with humbold of the Embassy to seeBreckenridge Long of the State Dept.Long is in charge of the negotiationswith the S, American states about theirenemy alien deportees. Long explainedto me that the State Dept. vere muchCatal Catalbgneerefereatceukvr4Agictivities.of of enemyagents 1n D. America and that they had5autherefore sent a representative to theprinciple states whose business it hadbeen to select the most prominent enemyagents and make a request to the governmenconcerned for their deportation. In thisway several hundred had been deportedand the U.S. J.S.Govt. had given an undertakingthat they would be sent on to Europe.It appeared that they had done thiswithoutany prior consultation with ourselves. We, on hearing of the matter,nad requested that those who wereundesirables should be detained. TheU.S. were in a difficulty because theyhad already given an undertaking tothe S. American states that these peoplewould be allowed to go free and thatsubjects of the S. .American stites con-cerned would be sent back from Germanyin exchange. The State Dept. did natwish to break faith. I explained to Longthat while it might be a good thing toget as many enemy agents out of S, Americaas possible, it was questionable whetherit waaltogether in American intereststhat they should all be allowed to eeto their own country. It was clear thethey would be used against us and thatsince america was now coming into thefield they would also doubtless operateagainst the U.S.A. Long said thathe appreciated this point and that anattempt would be made to get the S, Aermicastates concerned to allow the U.S.A. toretain a few of the more undesirableenemy agents. He mentioned that aCataloguerefepneeakyi4lego been taken to hold595NIKOLAUS and that the Case had beenconsiderably strengthened by evidencerecently obtained. He was obviouslyreferring to the submarine photographs.ony Rumbold is one of the brightsparks of the Embassy and has been veryhelpful to Walter Bell. Nobody seemsto think very much of the remainderof the Embassy staff except perhaps ofJohn Foster who I believe has been quitea success.I lunched with Bill Donovan and BartyBouverie. I gave Donovan a generalview of our experiences here. He toldme that he now had a mandate from theChiefs of Staff to start up an organisa-tion covering the activities of -.I.S.,S.0.E.,P.W.E. S.0.E. P. W.E. and ourselves in Lurope, MiddEast and Far East. He wanted to knowwhether in his outstations he should makeone person head of all 4 organisationsor whether they should communicate separ-ately to headquarters in Washington.I said that from our experience I wasquite certain that he ought to place thefour departments under one head,otherwisethey would undoubtedly get across eachother's tracks and the work of one mightwell be damaging to the others. Thishad been our experience, but it seemsimpossible under present circumstances toget any change. If he had ythe opportunityof building from the bottom he would bewell advised to consolidate his organisa-tions in the outstations. Donovan is avery likeable personality. He wasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1905atapparently a great figure in the lastwar, when he got the equivalent of theV.C. as commander of a battallion on thewestern front. I am told that his greattrouble is that he has no first classChief of Staff to keep him on the properorganisational rails. He is full ofideas but bad at organisation.I went back to New York on the 4 o'clctrain and dined with Herbert at thePlaza. He told me that he was stillstruggling to get the American mailsbrought up Cor censorship to Trinidador Bermuda. It had however beenagreed provisionally that they should atany rate go to San Juan in Costa Ricawhere they would be examined by Americancensorship with representatives of ourcensorship alongside. This was not whollysatisfactory but it was better thannothing and certainly closes the existinggap. He had apparently had a verysuccessful meeting with the combinedChiefs of Staff to whom he had shownseveral duffs indicating leakage ofinformation about the movements of Amert-can warships in the Canal wone. Theywere all very intrigued and they clearlysaw the urgency for getting somethingdone. Herbert certainly is very goodat putting over his points.June othI heard in the office that there wasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190597-evidence, btained in Lrinidad, that theItalians were using the spanish diplomaticbag for communication with S. America.I lunched with Ingram Fraser. He does notappear to have any clearly defined jobin the office and I cannot find anyonewho has a really good word for him. Hewas I believe at one time employ ed inS.0.E. and it is probable thereforethat from that organisation he driftedinto Security Co-Ordination. He andrepper seem to be running a certainnumber of agents vhomthey employed beforeAmerica came into the war. an undertakingwas given some time ago by Stephensonto Hoover that he would no longer employagents in his area. These agents weretherefore handed over to Donovan. Donovanhas however asked Frazer and Pepperto continue to run them and let him havethe information. They arecertain to befound out before very long and thedamage will be considerable, since Hooverhates Donovan's guts. I was told thatFrazer h d been running a mistressinWashington who was supposed tobe actingas an agent on the Finns. The was getting$500 a month for her flat and another$500 for her services, all paid out ofoffice funds. Stephenson heard aboutthis and had it stopped. Anotherunsavoury incident was when Frazer andPepper bought sterling on the DlackMarket which they spent on their visitto this country. On return they claimedfull rates.Catalogue Reference:kV/4/190sasI dined with Guthrie and Stratton. Guthriestrikes me as being something of a blufferbut energetic and probably up to a pointenergetic. He is certainly a go-getter.I am certain however that his firstconsideration is the aggrandisement of CGuthrie and possibly a peerage. Wediscussed his recent visit with Strattonto Newfoundland and Canada on the questionof security. They said that in bothplaces security in SO far as ports wereconcerned is practically non-existent.They complained rather bitterly aboutWood. They had eventually succeeded ingetting a ruling from the Cabinet inUttawa that the port security organisatioshould be set up under the R.C.M.P. withmilitary and naval personnel. e erre tosend out to or three people to trainthe various sections. There are alsoto be security points along the frontierand at the airports. Stratton seemed tothink that 200 men would be sufficientbut in conversation that I had subse-quently with Wood he seemed to think thatthe job could not possibly be doneefficiently with less than 800 men.Stratton is clearly a great supporter ofGuthrie and would like to see him as asuccessor to Swinton. I should say thatGuthrie was somewhat similar in typeto Swinton but not So able. He iscertainly ambitious and unserupulous.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/190THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENTINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDE? SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSJune 7th OctncooACT 1958I wrote to the D.G. and to Dick givingthem my first impressions about relationswith the F.B.I. and urging that e veouldbe as free and frank in our exchange ofinformation as possible.In the afternoon I saw Tibbett Who workswith Le Forgeais of the downtown officein vetting personnel of allied sericesrecruited in the western hemisphere-I gave Tibbett Theo's memo on the whitecard system, asked him to consider it anddiscuss it with me on my return fromCanada. I left by the night train, withWren, for Ottawa.June 3thand I called on Col.Murray whs isG..0.I to the Canadian D.M.I. in orderto discuss Springbok's traffic. It hadbeen suggested that both he and Tricyclshould put over certain figures aboutthe training of aircrit personnel whichhad been mentioned at the inter-alliedconference at Ottawa. These figureshad been approved by the J.I.C. in Mash-ington, their Ministry in London, andthe Americans, but apparently theCanadian officer who had just taken overAir Intelligence and was quite unacquaint-ed with XX procedure, was extremelyapprehensive and shocked at the ide: ofsupplying the enemy with suchimportantCatalogueoreferenice:kv/apigoed out that althoughthe information the information was6o0interesting I thought it ould be morelikely to depress the enemy than any thingelse. The trading figures for the pastyear were 18,500 and the future prospectswere even better. Col. Murray entirelyagreed but he was rather afraid that ifthe matter were referred to the Chiefof Staff there would certainly be deland possibly obstructions. He wouldbe quite ready to carry the respon-sibility on his level if he could getthe Air representative to agree. He wouldtry and think out some plan of action.I went to see Commissioner Wood at theR.C.M.P. headquarters. He said that Ihad arrived at a very appropriate momentsince he and the Dept. of Justice hadbeen having a great deal of troublefrom the Parliamentary Committee whichcontrols the Advisory committee on taeinterning of Canadian citizens and aliensThe Parliamentary Committee consists of re-presentatives of all arties includingtwo hot Left wingers. The R.C.M.P.have interned quite 33 number of communs sunder 21A of their D.R. (the equivalen'of our 1B) and the Left Wingers havebeen trying for some time to ascertainthe identity of R.C.M P. informants.They have therefore proposed that alliniormants should appear before theAdvisory Committee. The ParliamentaryCommittee, hearing that Birkett was inCanada speaking to the Law Associationgot hold of him and asked him to addressCatalogue Raferengerktvayrgommittee and theAdvisory Committee on procedure inungland Birkett gave them a most indis-creet lecture, mentioning his differencesof opinion with the Home Secretary inEngland and stating that he had success-fully insisted on the prpductioninformants. The effect of this was arenewed assault and violent attackson the R. C.M.P. Wood wanted to knowwhether Birkett's remarks were true.I said that to the best of my reco.lectionwe had refused to produce the informants,since having done SO in one case ourinformant had been blon sky high. Ithought that there was a distinction be-tween an of ficer of the departent whogave evidence and an agent. I knewthat wehad allowed officers of the departmentto give evidence and that when they hadthey had been cross-examined like pickpock-ets, much to out annoyance, but Ithought Ne had strongly resisted theproduction of any agents. Wood hadtelegraphed home but had got 3 ratherambiguous reply. I therefore arrangedto send home by Barty Bouverie who wasleaving in the course of the next twodays for England, a copy of Birkett'slecture with a note to the D.G. askinghim to get Pilcher to wire out the fullfacts to Wood. I told Wood that Birketthad beena thorn in our side since thebeginning of the ar and had I known hewas coming to Canada I would certainlyhave given him a warning. the epartment Wood got o1 inCataloguerReference:kVi4/19oJustice who was apparently responsible forTHIS IS A COPYRIGINALDOCUMENT ETAINEDGOIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SEOTION3 (4 OF THE PUBLICRECORDS HE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958. Dt Dooohandling internment policy. He was quiteconvinced that the attack on the .C.M.P.had been purely a political one by theLeft Wing., to ascertain the identity ofcommunist informers. Wood was i thinka little perturbed by the visit of Guthrieand Stratton. He evidently thoughtthat neither of them had much idea ofthe port security problem in Canada.Stratton had suggested that 200 menwould fulfil all requirements. Woodwas quite certain that at least 800 wouldbe needed. He said that since thebeginning of tae war he had had a greatmany things put on his plate and thatmany of his officers had been divertedfor purposes such as enfording currencyrestrictions etc. It was therefore quiteimpossible for him to provide the person-nel. He was looking to the Army to do thibut he had insisted that he should begiven picked men and not conscripts.June 9thT went withby the night trainto Toronto. Springbok came to ourhotel and we had a long conversation withhim about his position. He had madevarious attempts to establish contactwith the south, but these had not beenentirely successful. He nad howevercarried on a considerable correspondencein code with Sao Paulo. He was alsotrying to get into touch with B. A. byCatalogletreferiencerkeansgacquaint B acquaint Berlin of603his position. I had a long discussionwith him about the Abwehr training he hadhad. He had been 3 months with AbteilungII and 8 months with Ab.III. H number ofinteresting facts emerged which I subse-quently recorded in the form of a report.Perhaps the most interesting factsrelated to Frank RY AN who had been workingwith von BRANDENSTEIN in Ab.I II RYAN wasapparently assisting the foration of aCasement Brigade. Springbok did not knowhis name but he did know that he had takenpart in the Spanish ivil War and hadbeen interned by the Falangists and wassubsequently released at the request ofthe Germans. In Ab. III Springbok had serv-ed under Major Lieber, who had frequentlyvisited this country before the war,staying at a boarding house in Southampton.He had generally been accompanied by aMiss SCHRAEDER. At the time of Munichhe was going round the I.O.W. in a pleasureboat. He noted the movements of Britishships and reported them to Berlin. He hadalso been responsible for the recruitingof a Scot who had been in communicationwith Berlin prior to the war by W/T. Sprin-bok thought that the Scot was a ScottishNationalist. It is just possible that hemay be confusing this man with Snow, butI rather doubt it, since Snow did notcommunicate as far as we know before thewar, nor was Berlin his control station.Springbok had received instruction insecret inks, microphotographyetc. He hadseen the duff machine, and has given us adrawing and description of its working.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1906ouSpringbok is a mine of information andone could prbbably go on talking to himfor a month and still obtain from himfurther facts. The one confusing pointin his story is his statement thatAb.III was not concerned with counter-espionage. He bases this solely on hisown experience and the instructions hereceived when working for III Luft.te said that he was told to report onsites for aerodromes and on existingaerodromes and that he received specialinstructions that if he obtained anycounter-espionage information he was toreport back but not to investigate. Thereis probably some explanation though whatit is I cannot imagine.I spent the evening with Drew Brook, whois Wren's representative in Canada.He is more or less in charge of Springbok.I was very impressed by his keenness.He is certainly out to do everything hepossibly can to help and is taking immensetrouble to provide Springbok with thenecessary business cover.I returned to Ottawa on the night train.June l0thI saw Wood again. He told me that hehad had no case of sabotage and no caseof espionage since the beginning of thewar. He was amazed but not complacent.He realised that he had an enormousCatalogue area ReferenCe:KV14/190 to and that he was under-6o5staffed and that his force was not verywell equipped for counter-espionage work.I suggested to him that his best insuranceagainst penetration would be the estab-lishment of 4 or 5 first-class XX agents,and that he should regard Springbok as abeginning. He seemed pleased with theidea but I doubt whether he has muchnotion of how to set about the problemHis subordinates whom a saw are Asst.Commissioner Tate, an oldish man who isjust about to retire, and Drysdale, alsooldish and over-worked. Neither of themseemed to welcome the idea of any directassistance from an officer of the SecurityBervice. Wood however was quite open-minded. He felt however that anybodygoing out would very shortly be out ofdate. I suggested that it might bemore profitable to have someone in NewYork who could pay him constant visits.I rather think that Tate and Dry sdalehave been somewhat upset by the visit ofGuthrie and Stratton who must havegiven the impression that they do notthink very much of the R.C.M.P. This isapparently the view of the services but ithink it is somewhat exaggerated. TheR.C.M.P. C. are very well equipped to dealwith Communism but not very well equippedto deal with counter-espionage. Theyare essentially a police force employingpolice methods. There is not a greatdeal of imagination and there seems tobe little inclination to take the offensivThey give me the impression of usingCatalogue Reference:KVI4/190Goetheir pre-war machinery of informantsnotes and reports and hope that their ex-isting network will throw up any spies whohappen to be around. It may well betherefore that they are more penetratedthan they imagine. They have a largeenemy alien population very few of whomhave been interned. At the outbreak ofwar they only interned 23 Japs. Theyhave since taken in about 100. They onlyhave a few hundred Germans and Italianunder lock and key. I discussed thequestion of the Portuguese ship which hadcalled at Halifax in Newfoundland, "AlvarelMartens Homen", the master of whichis Carlo Maria Tomaz TEXIERA. It had beenreported from home that this ship hadalready deposited two wireless sets inNewfoundland and was in the guise of avessel controlling a fishing fleet, butactually reporting on the movements ofour shipping. The boat had been examinedat Halifax and found to contain a fairlypowerful wireless set, It had subsequentlyproceed ed to Newfoundland where the crewhad been allowed to land. There was howevno force there which could keep trackof their movements. I asked about theSpaniards. Iwas told that there was aconsulate general in Montreal with aright to communicate in cy her withMadrid and Washington and also to senddespatches by bag. There was also aconsulate in Vancouver which was lookingafter the interests of the Japs andwhich had a fully-fledged Japanese Asst.The Consul in Montreal was a man calledCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190607SCHWARZ who comes from a Rhennish familywhich fought for Napoleon in Spain. TheVice-consul is one ITURRADDE. He may bea relation of the man here who is suspect.The Montreal one is a member of theFalange. In Montreal there is alsonaJap Asst. who is a dual national. Iascertained later that Serrano Suner'sson is also employed at Montreal andthat the Spanish Consul at Panama,Bernard, was to be reinforced by a newSpanish arrival from Madrid.THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTRETAINED IN DEPARTMENTUNDER SECTION 3(4) OFTHE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958.062000 1958. 2000R..M.P. are very nervouslest anything should go wrong and theybe accused by External Affairs of causinga diplomatic rupture. I asked themwhether it would do any good if I spoketo External Affairs and impressed themwith the dangers of the situation,sincewe knew perfectly well at home thatall the Spanish Consuls were acting forthe Germans and that any informationwhich reached Madric was handed overimmediately to the Germans and apanese.Tate and Drysdale both thought that thiswould be a good plan.I saw Stratton and Strachey in theirlittle house on the outskirts of Ottawa.Strachey I gather is coming home shortly.I told them both about Springbok, whoseCatalogyaReferenee:kargitag ing to monitor and6O%also about the Abwehr station at Stahnsdorwhere Springbok was trained. Strattonwas interested to learn that Dublin wasincluded in the Abwehr network.June llthI saw Murray again. He was very worriedabout the R. C.M.P. whom he considered t.obe dilatory in their methods and lackiin energy. I think however that a gocdeal of his apprehension is similar tothat which we experienced here from themilitary in the early days of the war.Ido not think the R.C.M.P. are as bad ashe paints them, although their methodsmay be orthodox and old-fashioned. Iexplained to him the Spanish situationand told him that I was proposing to seeExternal Affairs. He thought this wasa good idea. He told me that in themeantime he had been able to get approvalfrom the Cabinet of External Affairsauthorising Springbok's traffic. TheChiefs of Staff had delegated to him andhis Naval and Air colleagues the necerrypowers for approving any messages sub-mitted.I talked. to Captain Brand and Littleof the Canadian N.I.D. about TEXEIRA.It seemed to me that if this man wasdoing any harm he would be communicatingeither with submarines or with Germany.What steps could the Navy take to monitorhis traffic? Did they know whethencheCatalogerecReference:kVt4/19b all? Little con-lessed that they had no notion, and that6 04it might be difficult to pick up. Thebest he could do would be to detail twoor three V.I.S in Newfoundland, but hedid not think they would be able to doany very effective work. The difficultyabout dealing with TEXEIRA was that Londonhad deprecated any drastic action onaccount on account of refuelling serviceswhich the British Navy got in the CapeVerde Islands. This thre a very differentlight on the whole position.As I was going out of the Navy building Ipassed Mountbatten who was under a batteryof press cameras. I lunched with Woad andAnderson of the Dept. of Justice at theR. R.C.M.P. training centre. Afterwards wewere shown all over the buildings andwere given a display by the police dogs.After lunch I saw Stone of ExternalAffairs and talked to him a good deal abouthe Spanish situation, and he arrangedfor me to see Robertson, the UnderSecretary of State on the following day.June 12thI had a further talk with Drysdale of theR.C.M.P. and I told him what I had arran-ged with the Navy Dept. about TEXEIRA.He said that the R.

There is obviously very littleco-operation between the Services andthe R.C.M.P. R. C.Drysdale mentioned one Adolf EdwardErick LINDER, Norwegian or Swede. Thisman has been mixing with Air Force officein Toronto and is generally consideredto be undesirable. In 1934 he is saidto have been in England. The R.C.M.P.asked me to let them know whether wehave any trace of him.Drysdale told me that Mrs. KRIVITSKY hadleft Canada some time ago and was nowin the U.S.A. As far as he knew shewas not in financial difficulties.I had a long talk ith Robertson ofExternal Affairs when he told methat the policy as regards Japanese wato evacuate them as far as possible fromthe Pacific Coast. This included Cana-dian citizens of Japanese origin. I gavehim all the information I could about theSpanish situation and impressed upon himits importance. He said that he wouldspeak to the Commissioner and I hope thatthis may result in an intensification ofthe enquiries that are already on foot.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/190RETAEDIN DEPARTMENTUNDER SECTION 3(4)THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958.

He had seen thecode 111/333 which had been in thepossession of WESTERLINKHesaidthaiit appeared in a book entitled "ElementaryCrypto-Analysis" by Helen Fouche Gaines,published by the American PhotographicPublishing Co. of Boston in October 1939.He showed me a copy of this book whichcontained a number of other codes. Weare taking steps to obtain copies forciruclation to censorship points andother peop who may be interested. Itseems likely thi if the Germans have beenusing this book they may be employ ingsome of the other codes it contains.I asked coughey whether he had anyapparatus for taking a movie photograph ofan individual in a room without hisknowledge. He said that the only appara-tus that he knew of was an X-ray mirror.This exactly could like be a fixed mirror to from the wall, the inside it looksand could not be detected unless a lightCatalogue was Referencesin4n1go. He had used thisGluquite successfully on one occasion. Ialso asked himwhether he had any specialmiking devices to which he replied thatthere was a machine which would startrecording immediately someone began tospeak, but it would go on recording untilit was stopped. If therefore anybodybanged the door or coughed it wouldimmediately start the machine working.As this obviously did not obviate thenecessity for having someone constantlyin attendance I did not think it wasworth bothering about. The apparatus ismade by the Recordergraph Corporation150 Broadway, New York.I saw Tamm who took me into Hoover.Hoover is obviously the prima donna type.He was very cordial and held forth atgreat length about his organisationand his difficulties. I gave him somepicture of our experiences in Englandwhenever he showed signs of drawingbreath, which was not often. It wasobviously no good discussing with himsuch matters as XX agents. His mindis working more onpolitical relationswith other departments. Before i leftTamm I made an appointment to discussfive points, on which I hope we canreach agreement.

I listenedto one of the lectures on office proce-dure. The course is quite a good onebut it seems to be purely a police course.I do not think that there were any lec-tures on the German Intelligence system,probably because nobody in the F.B.I.really knows anything about it.We dined with Goit, a pleasant individualwho according tohas donegood work. He apparently goes down verywell with the Americans. There arestories about his activities in the lastwar when he was said to be connectedwith Thornley Gibson in some sort ofceace move in Switzerland.

Financiilly he may have beena bit shady in the past but I hould saythat he was now solely concerned withassisting the allied cause to the bestof his ability.June l8thand I had a meeting withTamm who called in Ladd. We obtainedagreement on the following five points:1. exchange of confidential informationon the basis that it will be exclusive toourselves and the F.B.I. and that no actionwill be taken on it without referenceto the other party. Such information willbe stamped accordingly.2. exchange of information on the signi-ficance of names and references in allintercepted material in duff or S/W.Tamm emphasises that this information o0also be exclusive since he would beafraid that if it went to one of bonovan'sboys they would be holding 4th July celebrations in the suspect's back garden.There had apparently been an instance ofthis in some case based onyinterceptedmaterial.

Bavinundertook to make enquiries and to pay apersonal visit to Canada with a view toplacing this matter on all fours with theexisting procedure for allied forces.He thought that if it were taken upofficially nothing would be done formany months if at all. Another anomalyis is the fact that the Americans arecalling up all neutrals for serviceabroad and that these people may turnup at any time on British territoryin American uniforms.

These cases were submittedCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190619 6to London in weekly or monthly reports.He wanted to know whether we wereinterested. I said that Ithought it wouldbe better if he sent us only such caseswhere there was reason to suspect enemyaction and that it would be usefulif before sending them he could makeenquiries with the authorities concerned.He agreed to do thisin future.I had a talk with Bates and Browriggabout the seamen's Black List.

The problem of interning Ameri-can citizens is equally a diificult oneThere was nothing equivalent to our LOBand it was therefore necessary to proceedby de-naturalisation. This is a cumber-some business a.nd a good deal of convinciidence is required. Capt. Drexler, whofeatured prominently in the 1930 espionagecase, was an American citizen andformerly Marine Superintendent of theHamburg-America Line, but since he wasa citizen he could not be interned eventhough he was taking a lively interestin German internees in Canada. Attemptswere being made to get nim de-naturalisedbut McSwayne was not hopeful.July 4thI saw Tricycle in company "rith MeSwayne anHe seemed to be rather full ofcomplaints as regards his treatment Sincearrived in America. It was quiteembarrassing for me as he was SO fullof praise for the way he had been handledin England. He maintained since hearrived in America his case had neverbeen given careful consideration. Hehad been obliged to spend a good dealof money because otherwise the Germanscould not have expected him to move inthe circles in which he was to collectinformation. Had they wished him to doCatalogue cover.catalgle:Refereryce.k9/4igoa have arranged aHe was ow in financialirio! 1S A COrYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINED62uiNN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958 .Oct Lookdifficulties and the Americans wererefusing to support him. He said he wasquite ready to live on a modest scalebut it was up to the Americans tothink out some suitable cover. There isno doubt I think that Tricycle has beenliving pretty well and that in anticipa-tion of financial support from Germarhe has run himself heavily into debt.I do think however that he has beenseriously mishandled. In order to meethis immediate needspaid him $2,0001 doubt however whether he will get any-thing out of the Americans. Wren offeredto pay half the liabilities which runinto something like $15,000. I askedTricycle about his visit to Lisbon. Hesaid that nothing much occurred outsidewhat he had already reported. The princi-pal incident was the arrival of theGeneral Staff Officer who had toconsider Plan Midas. He explained thatin order to get to Riohe arranged thathe should be given a diplomatic missionby his government. This enabled himto carry a bag and to deliver certaininformation which had been approved fortransmission to the Germans. He saw theM.A. and N.A. and was eventually passedover to Alfredo Engels, since arrested.He then made an arrangement by whichhe could communicate from Ne'York toRio through a Brazilian Captain. Thisarrangement subse juently broke down owingto the declaration of war by the U.S.A.CatalogueReference.kvi4n1goughly $9,000 in Rio.625Later Wren and I went on to see Foxworthwith whom we discussed the position ofTricycle. I gave Foxworth our viewsabout the XX agent system and impressedupon him that it was impossible to runa man like Tricycle the way they weredoing. We had found it necessary to haveas many as 8 or 9 people who devotedthemselves entirely to XX work. Foxworthimplied that it was impossible for hisorganisation to detail SO many men forthis work. He did not seem to comprehendthe importance of it. He was thinkingall the time in terms of a balancesheet.Tricyele had been there for SO manymonths, he had cost the F.B.I. SO much, hehad given the enemy certain good if notvital information. All this was on thedebit side but there was nothing on thecredit side. I tried to explain toFoxworth that there was a great deal onthe credit side. He had had a man whofor 6-8 months had been in the confidenceof the enemy and who was therefore some-thing in the nature of an insuranceagainst penetration. If he could reacha stage where he had the majority ofthe German agents in the U.S.A. underhis control, his problem inu dealingwith counter-espionage would be largelysolved. Having heard that Foxworthwas by far and away the ablest and mostintelligent representative of the F.B.I.I was a little disappointed by theinterview. He struck me as being singular-ly narrow in his outlook. It may avebeen that he was too harrassed by theCatalogue Reference:KVI4/190624sabotage case to enter into serious con-versation on the question of double-agents. He had just returned from along visit to .America. He said thathis policy there was to get all theillicit wireless stations closed down.I rather gathered that he had beenresponsible for closing the station atValparaiso. His idea was that bygetting Chilean and Argentinian authoritisto take action public feeling wouldbe aroused against Germany and thatultimately both these countries wouldbe driven off their neutrality. Ifthere were any chance of his beingsuccessful in this regard the pricemight be worth paying, otherwise he wasobviously doing himself and us harmsince he would drive communications intoother channels which it might be diffi-cult to discern.Foxworth gave me a promise to send fulldetails about the sabotage case as soonas the trial was completed. Matters arebeing SO rushed that it seemed doubtfulwhether they would ever get the fullstory.I had a talk with Karri-Davies about theseamen's black list. He had succeeded inextracting the list from the Navybut since it seemed to consist to a largeextent of communists and to be extremelybulky, I asked him to try and get theNaval Authorities to reduce them to mana-geable proportions. We were really onlyCatalogiletrefererfceikvsngoagents. K-D doubted627whether the Americans had any generalBlack List. He thought in any case thatit would be of little value to us.I had a long talk with Madement who gaveme a list of the ISOS groups in whichthe Americans had expressed interest.It was clear that they must already bereading a number of these services owingto the information that they had gainedfrom RiO and Valparaiso. This eing SOthey would probably take action if anyof the material seemed to concern them.I thought therefore ind in this Madementagreed, that it would be much betterto come clean on the European materialand give an undertaking to the Americansthat we would watch their interests.If they guarantee not to take action onEuropean material without prior referenceto ourselves we could give a similarguarantee with regard to material obtainedin the Western Hemisphere.Madement was now experiencingconsiderable difficulties since gougheyof the F.B.I. had insisted that thegeneral agreement with Hoover that theServices should only be approached throughhimself should apply equally as regardsMadement's relations with the FeceralCommunications Committee and the coastguards. Madement was therefore reducedto putting his requests to these bodieson paper and handing them to the F.B.I.This inevitably meant a delay of a week orSO and an unsatisfactory answer,since theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190624F.B.I. did not speak Madement's language.I suggested that Madement should getStephenson to see Hoover in order toobtain his permission for some measureof elasticity to be applied to theagreement. His case seemed quiteunanswerable and the present arrangementwas only damaging to us and to Hooverif he had the sense to see it.July 5thI had a talk with Bailey, the CanadianProfessor who is in charge of Stephenson'scommunications. He showed me hisadaptation of the telecrypton which is atape punched with holes in such a way asto put any message into a one-time table.This is then transmitted and comes outautomatically at the other end. This isused for communication both withOttawa and Washington. Some adaptationis being suggested for communicationwith Europe. Bailey is very worriedby the restrictions being placed upona frank talk with the Americans on thesubject of ISOS. He said that ourpresent reluctance to tell then what wewere doing was creating a very uncomfort-able atmosphere. Madement had recent alist of the stations that we were monitor-ing with strict instructions that therewere for his information only. Baileyon his own initiative had passed theseHeewersrirariengeatrectagonfidence. nequite readyto stand the racket and had the supportCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION(4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSG 29ACT 1958o0oof Stephenson.

Heentirely agreed with these proposals.He asked me to let him know if we nadinynrecords in England of Coit, sinceit had been suggested to him that Coithad a bad history dating from the lastwar.

It seems that at 10,000feet the pressure at ground levelis reduced by half. The gases in thestomach consequently expand and createa feeling of fulness. We then had tosign a form saying that we did not holdthe British Govt. responsible foranything that might happen to us.Nobody seemed to worry much about myluggage which was supposed to be 40 lbsbut must have been 5o or 60.July 7thand I paid a visit to Supt..Gagnon,the head of the R.C.M.P. in MontrealWe discussed with him the question ofaction against the Spanish Consulate inMontreal. He said that the telephoneSO far revealed nothing of interest. Igather however that he was going to tryand insert a. mike and also to get anagent inside. He talked a lot about theFrench Canadians. He seemed to thinktha t the question of conscription hadbeen badly handled. It was largely apolitical issue which had been runningsince the Boer War. He thought therewould be no difficulty in getting FrenchCanadians to enlist voluntarily if therewere allowed to have their own battalionofficers. There was no necessity to putthem into the same division or even tobrigade them but the English Canadaansdid not really understand the habits andCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190This IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTIONACT 3(4 1958.0c2000 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSG{customs of the French Canadians andprovided they had their own officers allwould be well. He explained that theFrench Canadians were interested in theFrench language and culture of the 17thcentury but that they had no interestin France or Frenchmen of today! Theywere 100% Canadian. They were increasingrapidly compared with the English-speakingpopulation. Gagnon struck me as beinga very fine fellow, and I should imaginethat he would probably be Commissionerbefore he is finished. I gather that hecomes next but one on the list. Wediscussed the KLECZYNSKY case. I saidthat we were quite convinced that thewhole incident of the bomb being placedin Sikorski's plane was phoney. Gagnonentirely agreed. The officer on the casehad come definitely to this conclusion athis interview with the Polish Ambassadorin Washington. Obviously there had beenan attempt to hish the whole thing up.July 8tha.nd I were picked up at om hotel at8.30 after collecting our documents whichhad been deposited in the aerodrome safefor the night. We got into our parachutesthe harness of which is rather uncomfort-able. We were told that if we had tojump we should push the parachute awaywith the left a.rm and pull the cordafter 3 or 4 seconds drop with the rightCatalogue Reference:KVI4/19C(7I had the feeling that I should bequite unconscious when the momentarrived to pull the cord. We eventuallcrawled into the plane with our flyingkit. Six of us had to go in the bombrack and four in the small cabin, whichhad windows. The machine was a four-engine Liberator. We carried a fullweight less l1 lbs. The crew consedof 4 or 5, the pilot being Moll,the famous Dutchman employed by K.L.M.I was told that short of the enginefalling out he had dealt with almostevery situation in the air. Therewere two members of the Ass.Press.ofAmerica on the plane who were goingas far as Gandar in Newfoundland. Theywere doingan article with photographson the Ferry Command. They tooknumerous photographs of us in theCabin.We did not fly very high, I should thnkabout 8,000 ft. One of the officers,in the party seemed to be slightlyin distress and was given his oxygemask. A WAAF also came with usas far as Gandar. She was doing herfirst flight, and except for a fewbumpy moments seemed to enjoy it.We reached Gandar in about 4 hourshaving left Montreal at about 10.There we had a meal and after about2 hours wait we were told to get intoour flying kit.

If this mechanismfails you have to blow it up yourself,through a tube. It was extremely hotat Gandar. We erawled on our handsand knees into the inside of the planeand on this trip I travelled in thebomb rack on a mattress. We were toldthat we should have to use oxygenall the way, as Moll made a habit ofgoing straight up into the strato-sphere. Almost immediately after westarted the oxygen was laid on and weplugged into the feed at the back ofus. I confess to a slight feeling ofclaustrophobia at first. There werefour of us lying face to face in akind of half-moon shape, in full kit, Wwith the rather tight uncomfortablemask over the nose and mouth. It wasimpossible to speak or hear. We allchewed gum going up and coming downas this gave some relief to the pressuron the ears. The only thing to do wasto read, since we were not allowed togo to sleep tn case we should fall onour oxygen tubesand go into a coma.I read almost the whole way, andoceasionally kicked my fellow passengerwhen I thought they were going tosleep. On one occasion after takinga deep breath I pulled out my plugin order to hand some rather welcomehot coffee and sandwiches to one ofCatalogue Refererceikin4Afgoice at the other endb2uof the plane.I found this prettyexhausting and was quite glad to getback to my mattress and plug in againI had taken the precaution to relievemyself, with some difficulty, owingto flying kit, before starting.In the event of nything beingnecessary on the plane, the instruc-tions were to take 8 deep breathscrawl up the hatchway into the cabiand SO to the toilet, where we hadto plug in again. I did not in factfind this necessary. I don't know whatanybody does if they feel sick. MercifuI didn't.We did the trip in 10 hours, landingat Prestwick.July 9thI was quite glad to get out of thecabin and still more to get out ofthe flying kit.

The incidentwas cabled to the C.0. by the head of thelocal censorship unit, who complained thathe had not been informed in time of tharrival of the plane to get nis censorship machinery into action. The C.O. havecabled to the Governor asking him toinvestigate the incident. The wholeaffair has thus been dragged into the fullblaze of publicity. This is all themore unfortunate as nothing was found onARMANDO, who by the terms of the arrnge-ment with the F.O. had to be allowed tocontinuehis jounney. However, he canhardly claim to work as a secret agentfor the Germans on British territory infuture.As a result of further work on the Arcticcase it seems probable that only one manmay be really guilty, and he may yetbe found to have been merely a tool. OnMilmo's suggestion a demarche is goingto be made to the Iceland Govt. takingthe offensive and putting them in thewrong by complaining about the wholeincident, particularly about the IcelandicConsul, Thome, at Vigo.The problem of the owers under whiche enemyagents should be arrested in the Colonies,CataldgueReference:kv/47igo over the detention648of SOBHY HANA at Mombasa, is being dis-cussed by Pilcher ovith the H.0. and C.O.Dick had a discussion with S.0.E. on theextent to which they could help us byproviding information. Archie Boyle andT.A.R. were present. Doyle was anxiousto help but did not want to do anythingwhich was not in S.0.E's charyer. Hefelt however that it was well withintheir powers to assemble all C.E. by-products which came to hand during thesourse of their activities, and thatthere could be no harm in passing suchinformation to us. He thought the bestway to initiate such action would be forhim to write a letter both to C. andto us explaining what he was doing andpassing to each the results. He furthersaid ne thought it very important thatsomeone should be collating and inter-preting all available informtionfor the pnrpose of defending the twoIntelligence Services from penetrationby the enemy.Woolrych began his visit today in returnfor T.A.R. T. A. R. S to the S.0.E.Training School.Kellar has written an excellent accountof the Pasha's Intelligence Service.It is clear that the Pasha has such anorganisation and that he has direct ansof communication with Cairo and probablyalso to other centres. There is no evidenceCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190tutthat he uses the information he obtainsfor communication to the enemy and Kellaris of the opinion that he is far morelikely to want to use it to impress theBritish with a view to furthering hisown claim to a high position in the unitedIslam of the future.June l6th The Czech XX agent Max, who isshown on ISBA to have betrayed us tothe Germans, is to be brought back tothis country if possible. The presentsuggestion is that he should be de liveredover to the Czechs for court-martial andfurther interrogation.The R.F S. have turned up a spy in theperson of a Dutchman called DRONKERS.This man arrived in the U.K. nearly amonth ago in company with a half-casteand another man, who like himself wasan employee of the Posts and &c Telegraph.DRONKERS was interogated by a DutchIntelligence officer who by his knowledgeof certain associates and contacts wasable to prove that DRONKERS had a broth-in-law who was a wellknown Quislingcalled KLAEVER. DRONKERS eventuallyconfessed that he was Karel van DONGEN,an ISOS character known to us for some time.His cover address is the same as thatof Father and MEISSTEUFFEN, and was brougnover in the pages of a dictionary. Healso tried to get a broadcast messageof his arrival sent in the name of Karel.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/190647Dick discussed with Stephens whatassistance could be given by him to S.I.M.E. in the creation of a camp on thesame lines as his own in the Middle East.It was pointed out that it would probablybe located in Palestine, where considera-tion must be given to local buildingmaterials and limitations of soldiersfor guard duties. As a result of thisconversation Stepehsn is working on ablue-print for a falestine 020 but isadamant that he cannot lend one of hisofficers as he is already short staffedand Huntercombe will soon be coming intobeing. He suggested however that a suit-able candidate could be trained at 020.Dick went round Camp 020 with Stephens,and says that it is at last a finishedarticle. Its resemblance to Dachauis somewhat pronounced, since there arelong pathways commnanded by searchlights,while even the allotments are neatlypartitioned by barbed wire fences ofconsiderable height.June l8th Dick had a long discussionwith Frost about the position of theH.S.S. As a result of this he thinksthe following problems must be faced andsettled in the near future:1. What is the status of the S.S.8S.I.S.Committee - is it a controlling body overthe R.S.S. and can it intrude upon thetechnical administration of the I.S.S.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/190bus2. the position of the mobile units andpersonnel for snifting work. The questionhere is whether M.I.5 should not controlthe mobile units and in addition developnot SO much as part of R.S.S. but moreon B.6 lines, special personnel trainedin radio matters, who could operate onspecial snifting. The technicians, suchas Swann and Sclater, say that when itcomes to investigating a case likethat of the Luppitt affair, experiencein intelligence is probably more importantthan technical skill. There is no reasonwhy personnel should not be taken fromthose at present available to work themobile units, who could be under thecontrol of M.I.5 and adapted to this kindof work. Swann has already made astart at it. Maltby however is challen-ging the right of M.I.5 to conduct any-thing in the nature of snifting, evenwhen it incorporates the insertion of theindividual under a special cover for thepurposes of investigation. This seems tobe a very questionable position for usto be in.3. Who is responsible for V.H.F? Thisi a perennial problem which has becomevery significant at the present momentwith the development of V.H.F. techniquewith us and consequently presumably withthe Germans. An expedition recently sentto the Isle of Wight obtainedhighlyinteresting results in this field, andthe range was found to be something inthe neighbourhood of 90 miles. SomethingCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190649related more to the I.B. organisation thanopresent R.S.S. should be adapted forthis purpose and put under the generaldirection of M.I.5.OORIGINAL IN 3 ACT (4 DEPARTMENT THIS IS OF 1958 THE DOCUMENT Do PUBLIC A UNDER COPY old RECORDS RETAINED SECTIONAn agreement has been reached betweenWoolrych, Dick and T.

D.M.I did notseem to be veryenthusiastic since he envisaged th that theywould go to the Operations Branches andknowledge of the whole system wouldspread. He thought it was preferablethat Bevan, the suecessor to Stanley,should be brought on to the W.Doardand should be made acquainted withthe work of the Twenty Committee.I had a long talk with C., and gave himmy impressions of America. He asked memy vies about the new organisation to beknown as D.O.C.E. (Directorate of Counter-Espionage). I said that I had not reallyhad time to consider the matter, whichinvolved a reinforcement of Section V.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/190656with certain personnel from D.Divisionunder Dick. Cowgill and Dick were to beassistant directors and Vivian a directorwith dual responsibility to C. and D.G.The idea of a Joint Section had apparentlybeen accepted by the D.G. at a meetingwith Swinton before the latter left forN.Africa.I gave C. my views about the attitudeof the F.B.I. I said that the maintrouble was the dearth of informationabout what was going on in Europe andthe feeling among the Americans thatwe did not trust. them. I did not putforward the suggestion that Stephensonshould be given a mandate from theSecurity Service.July 14thI saw the D.N.I.,D. of I. and Findlater-Stewart about the W.Board meeting, and toldthem about my visit to America. BothD.N.I. and D. of I. seemed in favour ofallowing their Twenty Commmitteerepresentatives to give the whole oftheir time to XX work. Findlater wasas usual very sympathetic. I gave himmy views about D.O.C.E. One essentialis that Section V. should be housed inthe same building as ourselves.Field-Robinson and Thornley of S.O.E.came to see me, firstly about KURTZ, whomthey want to send to Switzerland in theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1906s7capacity of a Legation official. I saidthat although I had thought that he wasthoroughly trustworthy I should ratherhesitate on security grounds to recommendto the F.O. that he be employed withinthe Legation where he would be bound tohave access to a good deal of information.He still had relations in Germany andpressure might be brought to bear on him.I doubted whether he was a very strongcharacter. It was eventually decidedto send KURTZ to S. America and to tryEdward Bloomfield for the post in Swit-zerland.Thornley was anxious to know about WITT.I got down Aiken-Sneath who explained theposition. Sneath, contrary to the viewheld by 020, believes that WITT, thoughanti-Hitler, is a National-Socialistand a German agent. There is howeverno satisfactory proof.July 15thAttended Dick's Wednesday meeting. LaterI had an hour's interview with Duff-Cooper. I gave him an outline of .Divm.and a brief history of our activitiessince the period preceding the war. Ialso told him of my experiences in America.He was not very responsive, but I daresay he was feeling somewhatybewildered.I got the impression that he imaginedhimself in the position of a Secretary ofState running a department but without anyatalogaeeferencekkvealrgowhich would show himwhat the department was doing. He wasanxious to see as many members of theSecurity Service as possible, in orderthat he might become better acquaintedwith our work.I went on to the W.Board meeting. Wefirst discussed methods of gettingapproval for answers to questions aboutAmerican troops in this country. Suchquestions were beginning to come in anditwas impossible to say that we did notknow about them, as they were beginningto swarm about the country. I said thatwe could not possibly give these answerewithout American approval since soonernorlter we should be found out and the con-sequences would be serious. It wasfinally decided that D.M.I. shouldapproach Gen. Eisenhower and the D.N.I.Admiral Stark. We would try and getthem to nominate some reliable officer,possibly their representative on theI.S.S.B., if he turned out a satisfactoryperson. We then discussed T.A.R.S T.Amemo. D.N.I. and D.Of I. promised a whtime man to the work of the TwentyCommittee. D.M.I. said he woud consultand see what can be done. It was agreedthat Bevan should join the W.Board andbe placed au fait with the TwentyCommittee's affairs.After the meeting I discussed with C.the question of putting our cards on thetable about European ISOS. He wasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1906$9inclined to agree that something of thekind should be done, and asked me to putmy views in writing. C. told me thataccording to his information the GermanGeneral Staff wanted to get the Russianoffensive over in order to transfertroops to the West. They were appre-hensive about the 2nd Front. Hitlerthought on the other hand that therewould not be a 2nd Front this year.July l6thWe had R.S.

S.0.E. wereafraid thatif Dufour was handed back tothe French the story of Borrel's visitmight be extracted from him. Ourpoint of view is that we jeopardise ourrelations with the French 2eme Bureau ifwe.try try and conceal Dufour's whereaboutswhich are probably alre: known to theFrench, since they have suggested that weshould keep a watch on lle.Borrel.It was agreed that we should temporisewith the French and that in the meantimeS.0.E. should ascertain whether Borrelhad said anything to Dufour about herCatalogue Reference:KVI4/190661Borrel is apparently a woman of greatcourage, and the only female parachutistthat S.0.E. have at the moment.July 20thEndless D.O.C.E. discussions.De Guelis and Senter called again Theyhave found out that nothing had beensaid by Borrel to Dufour.

I told himroughly what our ideas where, but thatE wondered whether any organisation ofthe kind should have a head. It seemedto me better that we should retain ournormal chains of responsibility at anyrate for the time being. and let propin-quity do its work.

D.B.Felix, Harker Dick and myself. Dick Butlertook notes. S.I.S. took the line that itwas impossible for Section V. to move upfrom the country and that the locationshould therefore be St. Albans. I arguedthat we had been faced with the difficultyof having our registry in the country butthat everythin was now running smoothlyand that we had not suffered in conseuencFelix said that all the telegrams came intSt. Albans and that advance copies are sentCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190664to other sections in Broadway, if theywere concerned. From LO o'clock onwardehe was in communication with these sectionsin order to decide who was to tkae -theacticn. He did not see how it was possibleto perform this function in Londoh. L saidthat he thought it was possible he mightfind it much easier since files could bejoined up to the telegrams and sent up toLondon ith only an hour's delay on thpresent procedure. If they were requiredat Broadway they would already have trav-elled 7/8ths of the way and ne would bereadily available for discussion. Felixmade one rather fantustic claim that 80%of the agents caught Nere due to S.1.S.information. It was subsequently shownby Milmo that S.I.S. had been responsiblefor the caputre of 16 agents out of 87,that only in one case has a capture beenattributable to an S.I.S. agent, and in9 of the cases for which S.I.S. had beengiven credit the original information hadbeen derived from ISOS. Further that in5 of the 16 cases in which S.I.S. nad madecontact abroad with persons anxious toXX the Germans and that in one of the16 we had discovered that a woman employe edby S.I.S. was in fact XXing them withthe enemy. Out of the grand total oi 3720 of the agents have ISOS to nk fortheir captivity. Unfortunately we werenot in a position to produce these fi uresat the time. It was quite clear thatFelix had set nis face against any moveof his organisation from ulenalmond. C.Catatogue Rieferentcetkva/ligon V. Nas SO concernedwith other departments that it wasG6Simpossible to separate the work, that theydid for the S.S.. I finally said that Ithought that the whole scheme must standor fall on the question of location. Itwas essential for us to be in London andunless Section V. were housed with us inthe same building nothing would be achievedC. then tabled a plan for a directorateto be known as A.C.E. (Axis Counter-uspion-age) which would have a dual responsibilithto C.S.S. and D.G. Vivian was to be thehead of it, and to remain Security Adviserto C.S.S. while Felix and Dick were tobe assistant directors. As we had had noopportunity to stadyx this documentit was decided to postpone the discussion.D.D. however suggested that Dick and Gibbsand possibly Horrocks should visit Glen-almond in order to satisfy themselvesabout the question of the move. I thinkD.B. seeing that Felix was obviouslyobstructing, thought that this mightpave the way to a settlement, and to theexplosion of what is largely a y th, I amsure. This suggestion was accepted.Frost came to see me about R.S.S. He isthoroughly dissatisfied with the positionand wants Dick and myself to go down toBarnet in order that we may satisfy our-selves about the necessity for someimprovement. His main complaints arethat R.S.S. who are the technical toolare dictating to Intelligenee instead ofvice versa, and that the mobile unitsare unsatisfactory both on the technicaland personnel side.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/190666July23rdI had a talk with Curry about the D.O.C.E O.

He agrees with me that thesetting up of a new directorate is wrong.I dined with Wren who is leaving tomorrow.He has I think seen everybody in the dept.who can be of use to him and he is takingbackinformation on XX matters which hewill hand to the F.B.I He is veryanxious to obtain the services of Millsand Miss Sherer.July 24thI had a talk with Marriott about theos sible use of JUDE and GROBBEN as XXagents. JUDE is the Belgian who camehere from Canada and joined the BelgianAir Force. He knew Father and had beenapproached in Belgium by HACKE. Althoughhe knew that Father had also been approacheby Hacke he never reported the fact. Wetherefore came to the conclusion that hecould not be alloed to leave this countryand would probably have to remain ininternment for the duration. I hadthought that possibly he might have goneback to Canada as a XX. GROBBEN is areliable seaman who might have beenemployed if his case had not been bungledby the Navy at Gib. His mission was to goto America and then come back to EnglandHe had been recruited at Genoa or RotterdanThe Navy had pursued him from Gib. andpicked him off a trawler in mid-ocean.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/190667This fact would therefore be known to allthe crew and reported back.I went to see poor old Westgarth at theW.O. He has grown much thinner since Isaw him many years ago. He is stillstruggling to get some scheme put intoforce which will lead to production ofpetrol in W.Africa. For some reason orother the mines dept. and the C.O. turn hisscheme down. He has a pathetic beliefin my powers for helping him on whichmatter I did my best to disillusion him.I had a discussion with Victor,urrey,Miss Clay and Dick on Fifth Lolumn.Victor'case was considered and we all agreed thatit must go on. In the meantime Curry iswriting a memo on the 5th column generallyI dined with Lennox who was anxious tohear about my visit to U.S.A.July 25thCol.Allan came to see me about certain usndiplomatic correspondence which was clearlybeing opened. This fact had been detectedby the special examiners, owing to thecrude way in which the work was being done.I thought at first it might be one of B.2agents but this proved not to be the case.Allan is inclined to suspect somebody inthe Post Office.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/190668July 27thFrost tells me that there is still nosolution of the met.reports.

A good many of themcome from occupied or unoccupied France,and are merely getting out, not frompatriotic motives but because they thinkthat conditions are getting somewhatsevere. At present we rely on the S.C.0.to sort them out at the port. A certainproportion are told to report at Room 055for further examination but do not alwaysdo SO. A number of cases appear to behighly unsatisfactory. My own feelingCatalogue Reference:kV14/190is that we should have something equiv lent66Ito the R.P.S. for British subjects. Thiswould necessitate a new D.I R. compellingthem to report. If we had some hotel forthe purpose they could be told to remainin residence there, though free to moveabout, until their examination had beensatisfactorily concluded.July 28thI raised the question of the arriva. ofBritish subjects at the D.G.S meeting.Pilcher seemed rather doubtful about theprospects of anything in the nature ofthe R.P.S., which would be regarded asan infringement of the rights of a Britishcitizen. Personally I think it is theonly proper solution since without adecent set of records giving informationabout the various localities and showingconditions in which people have been ableto get away, we have not very much towork on.WARSCHAUER, an internee who was a directorof a company called W.A.F., has confessedun une er interrogatic by the Czechs thathe was recruited by a member of the GermanIntelligence named SAUER. He came tonotice through investigations into hiscompany which was trying to exploit amicrophone apparatus called Telfi. TheMinistry of Supply had wished to employthis company, but we had objected onaccount of WARSCHAUER, Bergl, and thedubious Hungarian financier Svarvazy beingCatalogaereference:kv4nfgoirm.b1oSir Herbert Williams was also mixed upin the whole business and was pressingthe indispensibility of the service whichthis company could render. It turned outthat the company had no useful functionto perform whatsoever. Subsequently wesearched WARSCHAUER'S premises and founda number of letters of a somewhat dubiouskind. It was quite clear that he hadbeen in communication with Germanysince the outbreak of war. He has nowadmitted that he was at one time in thehands of the Gestapo and that they passedhim on to SAUER, who gave him instructionsto come to this country in order to startup a business which would operate fromhere into Poland. The Manesmann Tube Co.notorious for its eapionage activities inthe past, were to act in some way asa cover. WARSCHAUER states that hedestroyed his secret ink and instructionsbefore leaving Berlin. Even non hisstory is not particularly convincing.We are inclined to think that he didintend to carry out espionage activitiesin this country, where he arrived shortbefore the outbreak of war. It is diffi-cult to say how far Bergl is implicatedbut one of the bottles which contained theink was found at his apartment. WARSCHAUEFis of Jewish extraction. Wiesner, theCaech, conducted the interrogation in amasterly way. WARSCHAUER had said thathe had an engineering diploma. Wiesnertested him out and found that this wasentirely. untrue. WARSCHAUER then said thatCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19067he was an electrical engineer. This wasalso proved to be untrue. Having got himon the run Wiesner then set about himand got him to admit that letters thathe had received from abroad were actuallyspy letters. He knew that they were fromSAUER because the date was always the 27thof the month. Wiesner asked him why the27th. He said that that was a lucky dayon which he had won a lot of money at thecasino. Wiesner then said: "If you donot speak the truth, you will be hanged onthe 27th day of the month, you willuhangfor 27 days, when your body will be placedin a coffin and nailed down with 27 nails.I have seen hundreds of spies in thecondemned cells. They have gone down ontheir knees to me and told me the wholestory but it was then too late." Thisharangue had a miraculous effect. We haveno intention of prosecuting WARSCHAUER butwe are interested in getting the whole ofhis story, which is about the first of itskind, i.e. the long-term espionage caseunder commercial cover. Craufurd has atlast been rewarded for his dogged persis-tence in pursuing these tediousscases.Dick has gone down to Glenalmond to lookinto A.C.E. and is to be joined by Gibbs.There has been an interesting B.J. whichrefers to the so-called TO Intelligencereports. These reports come from what isknown as the German special organ in Spain.The special organ is under a German whoCatalogue lfedReferencekv4/isob but reports direct to177the O.K.W. and not through the Embassy.ALCAZAR de Velasco is the principalfigure in this organisation which in ourview is a poor one, mainly because itdepends on Alcazar's mythical informants.We are fairly satisfied that he fabricatesa good deal of the information which hepalms off on the Germans and Japs forconsiderable sums. He is a low-class Av-bullfighter who has been put in bySuner as head of the alange Politicalrress Bureau.July 29thOn the introduction of Mavrogordato, Harris,Superintendent of Police at -agos, came tosee me, He has been on sick leave andis anxious to get a job with us here orin West Africa. He might be suitable asan assistant D.S.0. there. I should sayhe was of average police intelligence.He had co-operated with S.0.E. in WestAfrica and seemed to have anhigh opinionof them. I think his enthusiasm wasmainly due to the fact that he hadtaken part in the capture of the Italianships at Fernando Po which was undoubtedlya good job. When 1 asked him about S.0.E.Sother activities he seemed rather at aloss. He said they did a good deal ofpropaganda. I asked.where where and what forbut he did not seem to know!Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19673I lunched with Curry and dined with T.A.R. R.On both occasions A.C.E. was most thesole topic. Doth of them seem dead againstit and agree with me that the only solu-tion is for Section V. to come up to S.J.,to continue the Joint Planning Committeeon the basis that we have the right to COVEthe whole field of counter-espionage, andto have a free exchange of files. I amconvinced that if this is tried out for.3 months and the water is allowed toflow over us both, that nobody will knowwhere the Security Service ends and SectiorV. begins.July 30thDick has returned from Glenalmond. Whilehe is still convinced that complete amal-gamation is the real solution, he is SOcarried away with the enormous field ofwork on counter-espionage abroad which isSO sparsely covered that he thinks weshould accept A. C.E. with modifications.I told him that I was strongly opposed toa new directorate with its own funds,with all information relating to the GermarIntelligence system, and with power toplan and direct. In my view it wouldbecome another little oyster box, and thecase workers would be starved, and beforced to work without necessary backgroundMoreover 1 do not see how he was going toget his views accepted within the organ-isation since he would only be coveringhalf the world and would have over himCatalogueReferente:ki4rigee access to me to67uto the D.G. While I had the greatestrespect for Vivian and hisNork, I did feelthat he was very inclined to listen toFelix and that owing to the difficultiesthat he had had with Dansey ne had deveopeda system of over-canalising which preven-ted people from getting together abouttheir problems. Moreover he Thad pouredcold water on our original schemewhich was to say the least very reasonHad the D.G. stuck to his guns I thinkwe should have got it through since it waspointed out to C. both by D.B. and PatRiley that if the case had gone to arbitration it would not have a leg to stand on.A C.E was obviously heavily over-loadedon the S.I.S. side. I was certainthat my solution was the right one andshould be tried out as a preliminarystep for 3 months. Dick was afraidthat it would not be accepted and thatthe whole project would therefore breakdown. Both Dick and Gibbs thought thatthere was nothing to prevent SectionV. coming to London, and he says thatmany of the section officers felt thatthey are losing much in the country andare being by -passed by the P.Sectionsin Broadway. If therefore themajority are in agreement with SectionV. coming to London, it seems to me thatthey should obviously be housed with theirmajor clients at S.J. There need be noalteration in the chain of responsibilityat any rate at first, and the point aboutCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190678our having the right to plan in the foreigrfield has already been conceded. Anexchange f files can harm nobody as longas they do not leave the custody of thedepartment concerned. This seemed to bean ananswerabl case.We had a meeting today of R.S.S., withtheService representatives present. Itwas agreed that if a rush priority couldbe put on certain services this would meettheir demands. T-R made a short speechabout the particular services which seemedto have more operational content and weretherefore important from the Servicepoint of view. Felix arrived late,lookingas black as thunder. We told him thatT-R had given this information to thecommittee, to which he replied "I hopesomebody took a stenographic minute,othethan T-R himself". I did not reply tothis but asked T-R to repeat what he hadsaid at the beginning of the meeting.Dick tells me that Maltby and Felix hadworked themselves into a frightful stateon seeing on the Agenda that the secretarywas to state the problem to the meeting.They had wished to ring me up and havethis statement removed from the agenda.Dick persuaded them to do nothing of thekind, since it was just this kind of stupidsuppression that made T-R break out inthe wrong places. Eventually they reluc-tantly agreed. There had previously beena great fuss about the Service represen-tatives being present, and in order toenable them to withdraw gracefully I hadCatalogue Reference:KVI4/190676arranged to take their item first onthe agenda.Grogan has put up a memo to me on portcensorship. It is quite clear that theexamination of the crews, the letters,documents, etc. before the ship leaves is tto some extent a farce. Grogan hasrecommended that it should be tightenedup but admits that it can never benything like 100% effective. Tomy mind this is not a reason for notenforcing security measures to the utmostlimit, since in this way we narrow thefield of investigation.July 3lstI had a talk with Stopford and Cecil aboutplacing agents on board boats which plyon the main routes between this countryand Ireland. The purpose is to discoverwhether any members of the crew are actingas couriers. I am sure this is important,since the dvious man to employ is someonewho goes regularly by a fast route andhasna specific job which will not aroussuspicion.I saw Ran Antrim about a letter of hiswhich had been handed over to the policeby a MrS. Broad. It had reached her bymistike, being intended foryMrs. BROADwho lived at No. 3 instead of No. in thesame street. Enclosed in the letter was aC.C.O. memo about smoke screen trials,marked secret.

He is also going tohave a look at the air ports.August lstI have discussed A.C.E. with ibbs,CurrT.A.R. and J.C. They all seem to beemphatically of my opinion.Ernesto SIMOES, the ISOS character, hasarrived at the R.P.S. It is intended thathe should join the Percival aircraft fac-tory at Luston. the R.P.S. were hot toldabout him, in order to test the examiners.They reported that they were not satisfiedwith his story. At this stage they werelet into the secret. SIMOES will be keptunder observation at the factory for atime in order to see if he makes anycontacts. We arealso anxious to find outhis cover address, and a strict censorshiphas therefore been laid on.I talked to Ramsbotham about the formationof an American section to deal with allsecurity and C-E problems. yIt needs a headof considerable standing. Theo would havebeen ideal. I am suggesting Pilcher, whoI think would do it very well. Ramsbothamshould come into the orbit of B. since atCatalogue Reference:KVI4/19067%present he is working is espionage cases wiwithout any background.Five limpets have been removed from acork ship in Gib. which had come fromSeville.Springbok had mentioned a an.namedRudolfo BUENTE, cork merchant of Sevillewhom he had met at the Abwehr h. g. inBerlin. He was connected with AbteilurII. It seems quite likely that he mayhave been a party to the attempted sabotageAugust 2ndThere has been a long Ostro message aboutthe Middle East giving our dispositionsin detail. The service view is that it is90% accurate and denotes a serious leakage.Jonesis organisation has put up quite agood performance during the last six monthsOver 300 agents were recruited. Out ofthis number 12 are possible XXs, two havebeen taken on by the German Intelligenceand are reflected in ISOS and one has gomE70 out of the Japs in Lisbon with a prof 1150 a month and instructions to recruita regular courier.There has been a long telegr im from Maun-sell about the arrest of two German agents,EPPLER and SANSTEDE. Count yALMASSY startedon an Abwehr Kommando expedition tosouthern Egypt in May lastwith the inten-tion of dropping two agents at Assiut withW/T sets. This information which wasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDINl DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTIE3 (4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958.Ocktooobtained originally on ISOS, is confirmedby the capture of two I. Heer members ofthe Abwehr. ALMASSY unfortunately escaped.The agents EPPLER and SANSTEDE are bothmembers of the Aowehr. Henkins had beenlooking for them until the end of Julywhen he discovered that two ysteriousstrangers were in touch with an Austrianemployed at the Swedish Legation in Cairo.These two were arrested on July 25thand were found to be EPPLER and SANSTEDE.Twenty other local residents were arrestedat the same time. EFFEER is an Arabic spea-ker and has been resident in Egypt. TheAustrian employee of the Swiss Legationhad to be kianapped. Up to now there havebeen 50 arrests in connection with thiscase, 24 of whom have subsequently beenreleased. EPPLER and SANSTEDE are provingcommunicative and providing usefulinformation. Maunsell says that STELL-MACHER, an escapee from Zby. 800 is on hisway from Turkey to Egypt.August 3rdMANAZES has sent a letter to his sisterbythe letter shows signs of secretink under Violet ray.Ihad talk with Joe Archer. Our latestfighter, te Mosquito, is arparentlycapable of 425 mph at about 16 ,000 ft.and is probably the fastest thing in theair.

They spent some time in Parisshortly before their departure.It has now been established thatFRITZCHEN the British agent being trainedby the Germans at Nuntes for a parachutedrop over this country is going under thename of CHAPMAN. He does not appear tobe identical with CHAAPMAN of S.OFE. whowas captured some time ago.At the D.G.S meeting I raised the questionof a section to cover the hole ofAmericaCatalogueereferencetkvt4/19o a number of sec-68|tions in the office who have a liaison withthe Americans on a variety of subjects.It seemed to me necessary that somebodyshould co-ordinate the whole. The D.G.seemed to think thatwe should wait untilwe had seen certain American Securityauthorities. The worst feature of ourAmerican activities at the moment is thatRamsbotham is struggling with securityliaison and is also trying to do americanespionage cases outside the orbit of B.Division.the P.M. has left for the Middle East orMoscow. Fleet St. is buzzing.I had a discussion with the D.G. aboutN.Africa. Swinton has telegraphed thatLumbie of S.O.E. who has no particularqualifications as regards security and hasonly been in the Colony a fortnight, shouldact as our representative, and Haign-Woodas his deputy. D.G. does not propose toagree to this.D.G. has agreed to take on Stopford, whowill be in charge of Jones's section,placing seamen agents on board ships run-ning to the peninsular and Eire and S.America.The ink on MANEZES' letter cannot bebrought up. An impression has been takenand further experiments are being made.We had a meeting at Kinnaird House on thequestion of American security. It wasCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1906&2agreed that Sir Findlater Stewart Should beasked to bring us together with the appro-priate authorities.Ir lunched with Vickery. He told me thatHill, the S.O.E. man in Moscow, had hada curious approach on the subject oftwo lussian agents who had been operatingin Afhgnaistan. They had been kicked outand the Russians were seeking ourassistance. In fact we knew all aboutthese agents. +hey had been working forSubhas BOSE who wanted them to facilitatehis journey to see Stalin in Moscow.Later however he decided that he likedHitler better. The agents, who receivedquite a lot of money from German, helpedhim as far as possible and then reportedthe facts to Stalin: Subsequently theyhad fallen foul of the Afghanistan author-ities. This is the first indication thatthe Russians desire any form of co-opera-tion on intelligence lines. It followeda formal request by our minister inKuibishev to notify us of any attempt bySubhas BOSE who was then in Berlin toget back to India, but whether there ianything to connect the two incidentsis not certain.Vickery is anxious to send as much informa-tion as possible about the German Abwehrto India. So far it has not shown itshand there.At a meeting with C., the D.G. and Gibbs, NNicholson and Howard, West Africa wasCatalogue discussed. Reference:KV/4/190 that we should663 3establish assistant D.S.0. S who, if wecan get W.O. concurrence, should controlthe F.S.0. S in charge of the ports. TheseD.S.0.S would work in close co-operationwith C's people. C. is sending outHerepath to control his various unitsin W. Africa. Swinton has apparentlyobjected. C. proposes to ignore hisobjections. I do not hear very goodaccounts of Herepath and possibly Swintonis right.I spoke to C. about a plan which JohnSenter had put to me for testing out thereliability of the Fighting French Forcesat headquarters, which S.0.E. believe areunreliable in certain quarters. C. agreedprovided he knew exactly what it isproposed to do.There are 190 German Divisions, 7 Hungarian11 toumanian and 4 Italian on the Russianfront. The Russians have removed largestocks of oil to Central Russia from theCaucasus and the development of new oilwells is being rushed. The loss of theCaucasus is only likely to be felt inMay 1942.August 5thMcCulllum, M.P. for Western Argylle, an oldfriend of the D.G. , called to see me todayabout the leakage of information at Inver-ary. He said that indiscretions of officerin the area were appalling. He proposedto see Duff and Desmond Morton.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/1906suHarker has seen odrington about theleakage of information connected withthe P.Ms visit to Moscon. It seems thatthe P.M. had a telephone conversationwith the President before leaving.Sneath Came to see me about ARON andRITTER, who both need looking into.RITTER was formerly German Assistant M.A.in Paris and was brought over here withhis mistress ALTHIUS from Switzerland aothe beginning of the war. He had beentoneof Vansittart's informants, but as many ofthese were notoriously unreliable it isnot altogether impossible that RITTERwas double-crossing him. I told Sneaththat I thought we should make a realeffort to sift the case to the bottom andthat the first step should be to obtaincopies of all the reports that he hadwritten to Van. We should then reviewthese in the light of subsequent events.Kenneth came to see me about the reorganisation of E.Division. A suggestion had beeput forward for lumping north and soutAmerica together. Personally I think tmight be some sense in this but quitedefinitely the section should be in B.and not E. The problem is a counter-espionage one and both north and southAmerica are linked with Lisbon.Dick tells me th t from his conversationswith Viv. and Felix he is quite sure thatA.C.E. is conditional either on SectionCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190686remaining at Glenalmond or on theircoming up to a separate house in London.Glenalmon is obviously hopeless and aseparate house in London is little better.I am convinced that they must be in S.J.I went over to see odrington about theP.M. leakage. He seemed to think thathe was in charge of the whole caseand that he should call upon us to clearup certain points which were not withinhis jurisdiction. I told him it wasdifficult for us to operate unless we knewthe full facts of the case. Did heknow exactly what the P.M. had said tothe President in his telephone conversa-tion? He said that he did not but thathe had been assured by one of the secre-taries at Downing St. that no detailswere disclosed. I said that either theP.M. had intimated to the President thathe was going to Moscow or the conversa-tion would not have taken place. He mighthave said nothing which would have arousedthe suspicion of the ordinary telephonistbut he might just have Said somethingwhich would disclose his movements tothe informed listener. This coupled with acertain amount of W/T intelligence, i.e.telegrams going in Chef de Mission cy herfrom here to loscow,Middle East or Wash-ington would be quite sufficient. It wasobvious that at this time, If the P.M.was moving he would probably be goingeither to the Middle East or Moscow.I asked Codrington to let me have a copyCatalogueReference:KV4/19c of66I went with the D.G. to a meeting withDuff and Findlater Stevart on the co-opera-tion with the Americans. indlater under-took to stage a further meeting with theAmerican security authorities. It seemsto me that all we really require is thatour RSLO should establish a liaison withan American Security Command Officer inthe same way thatwe have a liaison withthe British Security Command officer.The problems would be exactly similarand probably we should have the answersryin our files to most of the Americanenquiries.The Afghans are starting to collaboratewith the Axis. They appear to be afr idof a coup d'etat by Amanullah supportedby the Italians.August 6thThere is a considerable stir in theIrish world owing to 29 priests and 5 nunshaving been stripped at the port. Theaction had apparently been taken inaccordance with the rule that anyone comirfrom enemy territory should be thoroughlysearched. The priests and nuns had comefrom Rome. Joe Walsh and Dulanty appearto be up in arms. Orr has not madethings better by severely cross-ex miningsome of these priests at Room 055, andasking them if they were loyal to thiscountryetc. He is within his rights butthe incident is unfortunate.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/190687I had a long discussion with uibbsabout W. .Africa. We are quite convincedthat the proper course is for us to takeover the F.S.Os at ports and link themup with the Asst.D.S.0. in each colony,the whole to be under the control ofHaigh-Wood.August Zth_I have been asked to review the work of thePress Section. I have been throughTangye's reports. He seems to cover theground required by most of the sectionsbut he is spending a good de l of money.We ust I think have a Press Section but Iam bound to say I should feel better ifsomeone else vere running it. Tangyehas nothing to offer the Press exceptdrinks, lunches and dinners. It musttherefore be accepted that in terms of abalance sheet ve cannot really get valuefor money. We could of course employsomebody of a better type but I doubtwhether he would take the trouble to getthe information which we re fire ind whichcan only be picked up in places like thebar at the Savoy.Brock,Bacon and Cumming have been madeLt.Colonels.I went to see Medhurst about Grimaldi.

Theordinary check on Post Restnte has produc-ed othing. It may be that S/W writingis going on and that some of the addressesare being used as collecting centres.Catalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/190689Curry has written a memo on the 5th Columnputting the whole question in its properperspective. I feel that he shouldreally co-dinate all sections in theoffice which take a hand in 5th ColumnSneatn, cases. and These Robson-Scott, sections would Jock be Whyte, Aiken-Denniston, Miss Weekes and indeed theFascist section. the work of all thesepeople is someone moribund and needsstimulating by someone with a full know-ledge of the Abwehr and its functions.We must I think regard the whole situationin the light of a collapse on the Russianerranean front, ourselves and 200 German driven divisions out of the brought Medit-back to the West.

They are therefore beingforced back on to simpler methods.I have put forward Dick's report on A.C.E.He gives an extremely good analysis ofthe nork being done at Glenalmond andits relation to our work and that of otherdepartments. He is so carried away bythe large field which is virtually uncoverethat he thinks that almost any sacrificeis worth while in the nation l interest.He therefore thinkst that ve should acdeptA.C.E. with modifications. Personally Ido not agree and have said so. I haverecommended that Section V. should comeupto S.J., and that Viv and myseli,Dickand Felix should form a Planning andOrganising Committee with a right tooperate in the whole field of C.E andthat there should be an exchange of filesbeteen all sections on the understandingthat they do not leave the custody of thedepartment which owns them. I am certainthat this would solve 98% of the problem.Dick thin S tha if we make this dem ndthe whole project will founder.

They are supported in thisview by the majority of section officersworking in Section V. but not by Pelixand Vivian. If therefore there is amajority view that they could come to Londowith advantage both to themselves andourselves, they should clearly for con-venienced be housed in the closestproximity to thei major clients, theSecurity Service. They are not beingasked to relinouish any thing and the chainsof responsibility will remin the sameat any rate for 3 months until everyonecan see more clearly what shape the neNorganisation should take or indeed whetheranything further is needed at all.Victor wants to send someone to U.S.A.in order to discuss the case of the 8saboteurs, 6 of whom have been condemnedto death and 2 reprieved. I think hecould do this with considerable idvantage,and the D.G. has finally agreed, previdedS.I.S. are also in agreement.D-u. has written a letter to Codrin ton aboabout the P.M. leakage, asking for thefullest possible details and pointing outthat matters of this ort come within hisjurisdiction.

When hispremises were searched it was found thathe had a dark room, and an exposed filmof M.I.documents. These documentsrelated to information that Ne had obt tainedregarding the German military machine,its weapons etc. GREEN has been interro-gated by Shillito in prison. At first hecontended that this was a film which hadbeen sold to him as unexposed and whichhe had subsequently found was used. Hedenied ever taking the photographs himself.Enguiries with local chemists shops hadshown that this statement was prob bly un-true and on the face of it it seemedextremely unlikely. GREEN finally admittedthat he was a Soviet agents He thensaid that he had been recruited in Spainand asked to spy aginst the Fascists.Heconsented to do this but the suggestionwas not followed up. Instead he was takento an hotel where he met a man whom hetook to be Russian. This man asked himif he was prepared to do espionage workin England for the U.S.S.B. when GREENCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190accepted he was given 140 in dollar billsand told to find his way back to thiscountry. He was told where ind when hewould be contacted after arrival. Forthe first 12 months after his arrival inungland he was not called upon to doanything. After another year he was againapproached and told to take a flat, toconstruct a dark room and buy a Leicacamera. Early in 1939 he began whathe described as his orgnisational workwhich apparently consisted of building upagents and contacts. When this machinerywas eventually completed before the out-break of war he was told to collect poli-tical information, that is to say represen-tative opinions of every class of Englishsociety. After the fall of France twonew considerations became important (a) itwas possible that England might be inv dedsuccessfully in which case the organisationwould be used for collecting militaryinformation about the German Army (b) itwas thought that a Fascist Governmentmight arise in England which would declarewar on the U.S.S.R. the main interestin his whole story is perhaps his statenthat between 5 and 6 months before theGerman attack on aussia he h d instructionsto turn over his organisation to thecollection from British sources of infor-mation concerning German armaments and trooconcentrations. His main source of infor-mation appears to have been IntelligenceSummaries. He said that of course he wouldpass on nything regarding British arma-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/190698ments which seemed of interest but thatthe Lussians' prior interest was in Germannot English military information. Mostof his ents worked for ideological reasonsince those who worked for money wereconsidered unreliable. inquiries arebeing made about various names andaddresses found in his notebook. It isremarkable that the whole set up of thisorganisation is exactly similar to theone in the Miss X.case. GREEN is ofcourse a Communist and has been known tus for some considerable time. In 1938M. reported that he was employed in certainhighly secret work the nature of which wasnot then apparent. He has got 15 monthsimprisonment for forging coupons and now ttells us that he did so in order that hecould use his car to make contact withhis agents. Ideologically he is a curiouscharacter and not altogether unlikeable.August 12thBurt has told me about his visit withCussen to see the P.M.S Swedish cook, whohad clearly told a friend that that theP.M. went on a journey.

Bron of Glas-gow complained that he did not get suffi-cient background. His officers found itextremely difficult to conduct interroga-tions Without knowing more about whatthey should look for. I said that Ithought ne would be ikelyeto get thebest assistance from the RPS There thesecond stage of the enquiry was conducand recommended that as many S.C.Osand their sub-ordinates as possibleshould do a course there. We would alsotry 3nd send down more people to givelectures.I remained on at Blenheim for the S.C.0.Sdinner when I had long conversationsuntil after midnight with wacBhail,laytonBrown etc. I am quite clear that the maintrouble is the bottle-neck of D.4 4.

In that way therewould be a mutual exchange and the S.C.0.Swould feel far more in the picture. D. 4should really do no more than Regionalontrol, namely look after administrationand policy. The S.C.O.S that I spoke towere unanimous about this but they allrealise that old Socrates is the niggerin the wood pile. I explained to thosewho complained that they never heardabout the cases they sent up, that 99%of them led to nothing. This was noreflection on themselve butinherent inour work. As regards the 1% theywould only get their information bydirect contact, since in dealing with aa case sent up by the S.C.0. there wasnever any specific moment at which one coulsay that the enquiry was complete and theS.C.0. could be given the final result.The conseguence was that humar nature beingwhat it is they never heard it.August 14thI arrived back from Blenheim at middayafter having seen Jock Whyte's section.I told the D.4. what I thought about S.C.Osand D.4 but I do not think that anythingwill be done. Old Socrates is to bepromoted full Colonel and be given a largermeasure of inderedence.

The D.G. has dectdedto give him Aiken-Sneath for his ResearchSection. Curry does not really want Aiken-Sneath but sees that if he can get himinto Research he himself may eventuallybe able to slide out into B.Division.My plan is to co-ordinate the Fiftholumn Sections in the office and I havemade a recommendation to this effect.Senter came to see me and brought withhim an interesting document which had beenextracted from the kit of one of theRussian parachutists sent over here who wasto be dropped in Europe. These people hadcome over by arrangement between Hill of 8.S.O0.E. in Moscow and the OGPU. It is aremarkable fact that Hill who formerlyspied for us in Russia and wrote a bookabout it, was acceptable to the Sovietauthorities. The people sent over hereappear to us to be of a pretty low.mentality and our efforts to get themdropped have on the whole been somewhatdisastrous.

The agent was. to callhimself DELSTRANCHE and give greetingsfrom Irene. The third address was thatof Marcelle LEROY, 1 rue de 1'Aurore?Brussels. This woman may be identicalwith a warcelle LEBOY mentioned in Inpre-corr as attending seme Communist meetingin 1936 in connection with the spanishWar. the fourth address was that of StigLINDAL, ondegarten 60, Stockholm. Thesender of a letter could give any namein writing to this address and shouldcongratulate LINDAL in French on his birth-day. Senter told me that NOVIKOFF atthe Soviet Embassy is Maisky's master andStalin's personal representative Thereis also here a Col.Tchitchayev who isin charge of the parachutists. He hasgot it into his head that Gen. Lakin is headof the Secret Service, and arranged aluncheon party with him at Claridges.As they could not get a private room therethey lunched alone in the middle of theball room.Tangye has had a visit from uiarker-which seems to have upset him.

TERPKOVITCHhad been stopping agents reports fromYugoslavia and it was suspected that hehad been passing them to the Germans.Certain individuals in the Yugoslav uegatiohave consistently been opposed to anyaction against TERPKOVITCH and they arenow trying to get out to Lisbon in orderto hush the whole thing up. they are allfighting amongst themselves and I shouldsay that there are not more than one ortwo who can even partially be trusted.They have no 2eme Bureau here with whichanyone can make contact with any degreeof safety. In our view they should berefused all communication in eypher orby diplomatic bag until the situation iscleared up.I dined With D.B. and told him about myrecommendations for the future of A.C.E.He agreed with me and said that e wouldtalk to C. He also told me about Pilking-ton of the special examiners in censorshipwho has had a rO and is obviously unsuitedCatalogue Referetce:KVan1goant Gibbs to take it703over. I said we had earmarked Gibbs forcolonial work and he was extremely usefulto us in many other ways. I would howeverconsider the matter when Dick returned.Lennox has told me about the convoy toMalta. Three ships have got in and twoothers which have been damaged may eventualarrive. 9 ships were sunk, to cruisershave also been sunk and two damaged.Two destroyers are damaged. We haverammed two submarines and probably twoothers have been sunk. We have also puttorpedoes into two Italian 8" cruisers,which were returning to their base.The Wops came out in force but as soonas a few rounds were fired at them they tuturned round and ran back. The submarinewhich had been sent specially to inter-cept them. the aircraft carrier Eaglewas sunk and another une was damaged.Curiously enough the authorities do notregard these losses as very serious inthe circumstances. they had reckoned onsomething like 70% as the proportionas the operation was clearly an extremelydangerous one. 36 planes have been releasefrom one of our aircraft carriers andlanded safely in Malta. Their missionwas to protect the ships while they wereunloading.August 15thI saw Archie Doyle with A.R.,Senter andLioneliHale.We agreed that on matters ofdeception it was desirable to persuade theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190Controller to set up a small comitteeconsisting of T.A.R.,Lione Lionel Hale for S.0.E.Montagu for the services and someone fromS.I.S. T.A.R. will take this matter upwith Bevan.D.D. rang me up to say th t he had spokento Stewart about A.C.E. and on the who ehe was favourable to my suggestion. thevwere obviously thinking of how theywere going to put it across Cowgill.Nash came in to see me. He is one of ourS.C.0.S a d is to go as Security Officerto the Banamas. I doubt whether the Lukeof Windsor will like the look of him.nice fellow but not very exciting.Curry has got an idea that we shouldendeavour through T.A.R.S organisation andother channels to embroil the Sicherheits-dienst with the Abwehr. there are ofcourse already signs that the two organ-isations have their differences from timeto time.August 17thI spent the day at Barnet. Frost has twocomplaints against R.S.S. Firstly he thinkthey should be regarded as the technicaltool as is laid down in the book, andshould be guided by Intelligence. As thingare at present, they appear to act solelyon their own initiative, if indeed theyact at all. G-P is apparently representingCatalogue Reference:KVI4/190705S.I.S. on the Y.Committee although heknows nothing about intelligence matters.We have no representation, although thework of the G.C &c C.S. in so far as itaffects interception of telegrams leavingthis country is of the greatest importanceto us. His second compliint is thatthe mobile units are unsatisfactory bothtechnically and as regards personnel.He recommends that as most if not all oftheir functions are performed on behalfof ourselves, Ne should take them over.I had a talk with Walker about pigeons.There are endless disputes going onbetiveen the Army and ir Force as to thefeeding of some 2 million pigeons in thiscountry. I beli ve that it takes 5 shipsa year coming from Tasmania to keep thesepigeons alive and certain vested interestsappear to be playing a part. It seemsdesirable that any of these birds notrequired for service purposes should bedestroyed.August 18thAt the D.G.S meeting I asked about theposition of M.I.5 in relation to theSecond Front. It struck me that whilethe F.S.P and I.B.units might well dealwith the Situation up to the first 50miles, there would come a time when wemight well have to function on the conti-nent or elsewhere. It might therefore bewell to ascertain exactly what our func-tions would be. I also asked about theCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/190706formation of an American section. The D.Gfectided to await a conference with Gen.McClure which is to take place shortly.Gen.MeClure is in charge of Americansecurity.Burt spoke to me about Antrim's case.He thinks there should be a prosecution ofMrs. BROAD in whose possession has beenfound a large number of compromisingdocuments, some referrin to privateaffairs and others to military matters.These documents are the property ofAntrim and -ady Diana Bridgeman.The D.G. has today sent off a letter toC. forwarding a copy of my eport onAmerica and suggested that we shouldhave representation in the person ofStephenson or wren or independently.Cussen is seeing Duff-Cooper on the P.M.leakage. The D.G. has written a criticismof Codrington's note on certain lineswhich I have suggested. There is stillmuch that is not clear.There has been an unfortunate incidentin connection with the case of ErlandECHLIN, the Canadian journalist internedunder 18B. U.35 had reported that hewas in regular receipt of L8O a month fromthe German Embassy in 1937 or 1938, andin putting forward the case One had saidthat this was confirmed by the examinationof ECHLIN'S passbook. We had intercepteda letter from the ank showing an entryCatalogue Reference:KVI4/190167which looked like E8O. In fact 80 wasthe number of the cheque which was for thesum of f3. odd. The Advisory committeeexamined the passbook and found no entry.They wanted to know on what our informa-tion was based. As the Advisory Committeeare only too ready to piek holes in ourcases, I thought it advisable to try andget Noakes, who knew Coekburn, and explainto him how the misti tke arose. tockburnseemed to be satisfied and friendly but neis going to recommend release. This isI think a bad case, since only within thelast week we nave obtained definiteinformation that even Freddie Kuh thinksthat ECHLIN'S case is not worth hissupport. ECHLIN is still an admirer ofHitler.Tangye says that ordon West of "InsideInformation" wishes to put in a para aboutthe P.M.leakage. He wants to say that thewhole question is occupying seriousattention of the authorities and to ask althose who he: d about the P.Ms visit priorto August lst to write to the Daily Sketch.Tangye has told him that we have noobjection to his saying that the matter wasthe subject of enquiry but that we didnot wish anything Said about the lstAugust. the Daily sketch is complyingwith our wishes.The D.G. has drafted a letter to C. whichrather fills me with horror. It seems tome to be right off the rails.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1907osMontague has drafted a note on deceptionwhich he wishes to be approved by the W.Board for sending to the American itgives away the whole of our etwork. thepurpose is to get the Services to see thevalue of the XX system and urge the F.D.1.to greater activity, but I am inclinedto think that it may go a little oo.far.August 19thI attended a meeting at Kinnaird Houseon neutral missions to this country. Bothmilitary and civilian missions:wer dis-cussed. The D.G. took the view that manyof these missions, particularly those ofjournalists,eerv no useful purpose.I said that whether they did or did not,it was essential tht the departmentsconcerned should realise that anythingthat they saw or heard would eitherdirectly or indirectly reach the enemy..It was deeided after a bit of a fightby the M.0.I. and F.O. that in futurethe Chairman should be notified aboutany such missions before we were in anyway committed to their visit.I took the weekly meeting. There havebeen certain difficulties about gettingSIMOES' employment at the aircraft factoryat Luton. Everybody seems to be highlysuspicious about have an alen which is tosay the least a good sign. 'These difficul-ties we have overcome. I told themeetingthat we were considering M. I.5s dutiesin the event of a second front. VictorCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190thought it was particularly necessary thatsomething should be done about sabotagesince ISOS shows quite clearly that theGermans intend to leave saboteurs behind.Another letter from MANESES has been seen.It has been decided to let it go on aftertaking an impression and to attempt toget a sample of ink from his lodgings.There is no doubt that S/W is being usedbut unfortunately we cannot bring it up.It shows up very sketchily under violst raybut it is not responsive to any reagent.Gibbs and i have redrafted the D.G.S memoon the subject of A.C.E. He had wanted tomake a beginning by putting 4 represen-tatives from each side in one room. Theywere to receive all the telegrams relatingto counter-espionage from Section V. andfrom B.Division, though what would havearpened after that I hardly dare to think.He seemed to think that he and i wereseeing eye to eye, whereas our views werediametrically opposed. Eventually weredrafted the letter suggesting (a) thatSection V. should come up to London and behoused at S.F. and (b) that I,V.V.,Felixand Dick should constitute a planningcommittee in the whole field of counter-:espionage and (c) that files should beexchanged provided they did not technic llyleave the custody of either department.Chains of responsibility should remain asthey are at present. The D.G.nas acceptedthis view.Catalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/19010Jim Hale has succeeded in breaking downSCOTT-FORD who confessed that he was knoNn'to the Germans as RUTHERFORD. On his lastvoyage from this country he was interro-gated on the basis of ISOS aith othermembers of the crew. He volunteered theinformation that he had been approached bythe Germans who had said that he hadtold them nothing. On this occasion hewas again interrogated and admitted thahe had told the Germans about certain shipswhich had been sunk in a convoy. He hadalso given them other information. Hewas stupid enough tocarry on him documentsgiving full details of the course of theconvoy and it was his intention to handthis document over to the Germans on hisnext visit to Lisbon. Inr some reason ortoher he thought that the worst that couldhappen to him would be internment. Helittle knows that there is a clear caseagainst him under the Treachery Act,based on his own statement and on the docu-ments found in his possession. He hastalked vaguely about other people beingconnected with the same g me. He is ciclearly extremely conceited. His hobbyseems to be women. He was contacted inLisbon by the Germans at some cafe andgot into the hands of rostitutes whowere obviously being paid by the GermnanI.S. to pick up reoits.Major Strangeways came to see me today.He is going for the ontroller of Deceptionto Gib. where he will disclose Torch toCatalogue ReferenCe:KV/4/190YIthe G.O.C. and VACNA. He will also tellMedland. I have asked him to arrange forMedlam's return to this country forconsultation as soon as the G.0.C. hasbeen put in the picture.August 20thThe D.G. summoned me, Marriott and Master-man to discuss the memo by Montagu ondeception which itwas pro osed should besent to america. The R.G. seemed to beextremely annoyed that Montagu should havewritten such a memo. I tried to explainto him that we applied for the Servicerepresentatives on the XX Committee tobe given whole time and that deceptionwas of course their main interest. Ittherefore seemed difficult to say thatMontague could not put pen to paper onthis subject in his own office. D.G.was quite emphatic that the document shouldnot go. It was no good trying to explainto him what the purpose was. I would havesuggested th t if the documents had beensent at all it should have gone toSecurity Co-Ordination and only releasedafter we had been given full details as tohow it would be disposed of. I quiterealised that there would have been a con-siderable risk. On the other hand we havegot to get the Americans educated in thevalue of the XX system since we shouldbecome more ind more dependent on theirco-operation. They h ve already made amess of the case of Tricycle throughCatalogueReference:KVy4/1go country He alreahave to get their approv 1 for our trafficsince the point has been reached where we ccannot any longer continue saying that we hhave not seen an American soldier. theplace is swarminf with them.

Heis informing the D.M.I. vith whom we wereto have had a meeting.I saw Hale about SCOTT-FORD, to decidewhether Cussen or the local police snoutake the usual statement. It Nas even-tually decided that this matter should beleft to the local police who seemed tohave SCOTT-FORD WELL IN HAND.I have given the D. G. his re-draited letterabout A.C.E. He is now doubtin theadvisability of bring up the whole ofSection V. He thinks that only selectedsecti ns or a representative body shouldcome up. I said that from the point ofview of Section V. I thought this wasopen to criticism. They would rathernaturally say that it must be all ornothing. I should have preferred tohave said all, and left it to them tomake other suggestions but the D.G.thought otherwise.Special material indicates that the Pashamay be transmitting from Luppitt over theweekend.

He said thattheAmericans were making a frightfulbaingle of their business relations withouth America. Instead of buying up theenemy business in a quiet and unobsrusiveway they were taking over firms and plastering the place with the stars ind stripes.This was doing them a good deal of harm.Wiseman did not think that we were runningany risk of losing our business connectionsin s.merica after hewar.

They had been recruitesome time in 1940, having been called tothe German Embassy in the States andtoldthat their services would be required bythe Fatherland. They. were not told in whatcapacity they were to serve. They reportedthemselves on arrival in Germany, weregiven some money and told to go awayto their homes and have a good time. Theyhung about for many weeks, until eventuallyan officer called KAPPE made contact withthem and sent them to a camp fo z.b.V.O 800at Quintsee. There they were told to writeCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/190725out their whole life history showing theplaces they had lived inand the contacts thethey had made in the U.S.8.:neywerethentold to indicate what places in the areasthey knew were of the highest importancefrom the point of view of war production.Having received training in explosives andKommando methods, they were finally giventheyr assignments. Four of them were toland at uacksonville,Florida and four onLong Island. They were to deal withtargets in their particular area, after ly irlow for about 6 weeks. They were providedwith the necessary identity documents,which were well forged. After 8 veeks thetwo parties were to meet at a conferencein New York, to see how far they couldbe of assistance to each other. Each mancarried a handkerchief with four names insecret ink of people in his area with whomhe could make contact. None of thesepeople had any prior knowledge of thearriv 1 of the saboteurs. Both partiessucceeded in landing in rubber boats fromsubmarines. To of those who landed onLong Island dragged their explosives upthe beach on to the dunes, where they duga hole and buried them. The other two raninto a coast guard who happened to bestrolling along the beach, totally unarmed.This was certainly a remarkable coincidencesince there is not more than about one coastguard to be found along or 4 miles ofbeach. The t to saboteurs, who were carryinuniforms, the idea being tha if they werecaught on landing they might be ccepted asP/W instead of spies, engaged the coastgu rdCatalogue Reference:KV14/19012in conversation and tried to make out thatthey were clam fishers who had lost theirway. They were getting on uite nicelywhen unfortunately for them the two othersaboteurs who had been burying the explo-sives, ran down the beach shouting inGerman. This rather spoilt the whole party.and as Kimball put it "the coastguardwas now beginning to wonder where he wouldget his pants laundered." The Germansapparently had instructions to despatchanybody in S.O.E. fashion who got in theirway, but for some reason ot other DASCHwho was the lader of the party thoughtthat bribery might be the best way out.e gave the coastguard $300 (only $260of which ultimately found its nay to theF.B.I) He then flashed a torch on himself,saying to the coastguard "Remember thisface". It seems likely that DASCH had itthis time made up his mind to blow the gaff.The coastguard having backed away a certaindistance, turned and ran to the stationwhere he gave the alarm. It was thenabout 1 a.m. but his colleagues did notthenk there was any point in doing anything till it was light. About 5 a.m. trreywent out when they diseovered the marks onthe beach and the explosives. They alsofound certain clothing. This led themto start an investigation on t eir Own,on the basis of the laundry marks. theygot nowhere and later in the day decidedto tell the Naval authorities, who took ove]the exhibits. They too tried.t do alittle priv te sleuthing and it was notuntil 8 p.m. that anybody thought ofCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190727telling the F.B.I.. The hunt then startedbut might have been abhortive had notDASCH and his colleague BERGER rung up theF.D.I. from the Hotel Governor Clinton inNew York. Certain F.B.I. representativeswho happened to be only two blocks awaywent round immediately and DASCH and BERGERgave themselves up. They did not knowthe real names of their colleagues but havibeen trained with them at the camp inGermany they knew roughly the area in whichthey had lived in the U.S.A this gavethe F.B.I. a starting point for theirenquiries. They eventually succeeded inrounding up all the saboteurs except one,who thought that he would bluff the F.B.I.in Chicago by walking in and saying thathe had been working. in Mexico and hadonly just got back and was now seekingregistration. The F.B.I. of course had adescription of him and took him inside.I saw the D:Mt: i. with Montagu about theD.N.I.S letter to all members of the W.Board in which he suggested that Bevanshould become chairman of the Tenty Comm-ittee in order to bring the Committee'swork in into closer contact with the require-ments of the Chiefs of Staff. I told theD.M.I. that I did not see that this wouldserve any useful purpose since Bevan wasalready a member of the committeee and wasin constant touch with Robertson. I alsosaid that while the present constitutionof the Twenty Committee, if indeed it hada constitution, had worked quite smoothly,we could not agree to any arrangementsCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190724that would place us in the position ofhaving to put over in deception messageswhich we considered would jeopardiseourD.A.network. I explained to hin thatit was the Security Service who hadrecruited most of these agents forits Own purposes, n amely counter-espionage Eand that I was quite sure that my DirectorGeneral would not agree to to anyarrangement that did not give him thefinal word in any circumstances whichmight affect their future. The D.M.I.seemed rather astonished when I to id himthat the agents were recruited by us forour own purposes. Ho ever he readilyagreed, and a letter was drafted to theD.N.I. explaining to him that the suggestedchairmanship of Bev an was u suitable andmoreover that Bevan had been consultedand did not feel able to take over the job.In the afternoon I attended a meetingcalled by indlater Ste art at which MeClurethe Americar Genera in charge of Securitywas present.

He save me a.n accountof Pearl Harbour. It seems that four orfive days before tae attack a telegraphicor telephonic message had been picked upgoing from Honolulu to Tokyo in a very simplflower code which gave the exact dispositionof all American ships in the arbour.The local authorities were fully avare Cthis but did not a arently take any pre-cautions.

The D.G.sletteris somewhat prickly and is not likelyto be very well received.I had a discussion with Dick and Gibbs aboutD.S.0. points in W.africa. I asked Gibbsto put up a note which will help me topersuade the D.G. that it is necessaryfor him to go out to W.Africa at theearliest possible moment.I lunched with rulford. He seemed tothink that this office had taken a biassedview about the communists and had neglectedthe Fascists. In this he appears to havestruck a sympathetic chord in Welles ofthe Security Executive. I told him thathe was wrong, or at any rate misinformed asto the difficulties of the situation. Ifhe was contending that the vetting of Com-munists by C.Division for special employ-ment was not always very intelligently done,I was nin entire agreement. He had torealise however that 50,000 people perweek were being vetted by this officeand that if this was all thron on theinvestigating seetions they would have aserious grievance. This meaht that vettingwas to some extent rule of thumb and unin-telligent. This was regrettable and inmany instances got us into serious trouble.Catalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/19073Apart from this I thought that we had takena very reasonable line about the CommunistsAs regards the Fascists, the movement wascomparatively young. It had been taken inhand several years before the war, and ourenquiries might have been considerablyhelped if we had been given some encourage-ment by the H.O. For years Curry wantedto get a H.O.W on the B.U.F. F. headquartersand on Mosley but could not get thenecessary authority.SCOTT-FORD has told us that one HENDERSONon the inland is suspect.

This can perhaps beanswered in part by the fact that there areother sources which have a more directbearing on the enemy's intentions. At thesame time 1 think Curry has made out acase for what one has always felt, namelythat all intercepted materiil should becarefully co-related and studied bynsomeonewho ls in close touch with the Chiefsof Staff.J.35 rang up to say that pernaps the answerto the bombing of Nuremburg last nightmight be the bombing of Oxford. I spoke tothe D.G. who decided to warn the countryoffice.

I tried to get Scott but hewas away. I also tried to get wcIver but hedid not ring me back. Finally 1 spoke tothe duty Officer at the Ministry of HomeSecurity. I told him at least three timesthat we had no specific information what-soever but merely a hunch on the basis ofBaedeker raids that the answer to NuremburgCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190might be xford. We had accordingly Narnedour own people but not the C-C. as wethought he might regard the matter asinterference or possibly work himself intoa state of pathological excitemnent.August 30thI spent four hours talking to Viv. it St.Albans about A.C.E. and about theAmerican situation. It did not seempossible to make any headway and I wasprofoundly disappointed. Viv. had evidentlybeen irritated by our original suggestionwhich he evidently regarded not as a cons-tructive suggestion which the presentsituation seems to demand, but as an attackon Section V. and Felix, which as a pointof honour had to be fought to the lastditch. He said that he was disappointedthat we had not accepted A.C.E. Which hethought was a generous offer. I saidthat I thought it unnecessary ind undesir-able to set up a new body which vouldreceive all the inform tion regarding theGerman I.S., plan on it, and issuedirections. If such a body was to funetrcproperly it must absorbe the whole ofB.Division and if it did SO it should beresponsible to the D.G. who would ultimatelybe held responsible if spies were foundoperating on British territory. Withoutdefining them very definitely Viv. talkeda lot about Section V.' respgnsibilitiesto other epartments. He was extremelyirritated by the D.G.S letter which L founddifficult to defend. He pounced upon theCatalogue Reference:KVI4/19073spoint of bringing up a representativesection. He said this would be impossible.I replied that that had also been myview, as I did not see how Section V. couldrun in two parts. He then talked aboutthe powers that would have been conferredon him if A.C.E. nad come into being, Isaid I thought that all the necessary powerswould be conferred if they constitutedhimself,myself,Dick and Felix as A.C.E.He seemed to think there mignt be somethingin this. use was strongly opposed to bring-ing Section V. up.to London for threereasons, all of which seemed to me to berather weak. Firstly he said that eommuni-cations would be extremely difficult andthat the Post Office should never providethe necessary lines.. This seemed to bedifficult to justify since our lines toGlenalmond would be available to carry onregistry enquiries. We should not be usinethem as we should be talking direct to theofficers in S.J. becondly, he said wewere likely to bomb Berlin and thereforeLondon would be bombed. This would raisedifficulties in accommodation for the staff.Thirdly, he said he was quite impossibleto move until after Torch had been launched.As far as I know there are no other reasons.Certainly none were advanced. I had theimpression that Viv. had absolutely sethis teeth against allowing the organisationto amalgamate with ourselves He said thatin his view proximity was of no value. Hehad learned that it was quite easy foran organisation to function at the outstations. I said that our experience hadCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190736been exactly the contrary. I receivedalmost daily complaints from people at ourcountry office that they were completelyisolated in a backwater and my ownobservations had confirmed this. He toldme that there had been a meetin of SectionV. officers at which the whole matter hadbeen discussed and rather gave me theimpression that Kim Philby's section wasthe only one who was really keen aboutcoming to London. I said that this hadnot been Dick's impression and that all thepeople we had sent down were unanimousin saying that Section V. could m ve vith-out dislocation nd with considerableadvantages to themselves. I am quite surethat loyalty to Felix and the organis tionthat he has built up is influencing Viv.against his better judgment, and that hehas now reached the stage when he cannotdistinguish between one and the other.I think there is a genuine fear that ifthe two parties once got together inthis office and the water was allove ed to-flow over them for 3 months force of cir-cumstances would compel some sort ofamalgamation. I asked himsexactly whathe thought the functions of .Division wouldbe. He said th t D.Division would revert towhat he considered to be M.I.5s properfunction, namely counter-espionage in thiscountry. I said that if that were so .C.Ewould inevitably become another littleoyster box and that the case workers wouldnever have the benefit of seeing the wholepicture. He said that he was bound to ad-mit that he had never looked at the schemeCatalogueReference:kV/4lh9oof view of D.Division.237I pointed out that either he would have tocarry the functions of D.Division in whichcase it was obvious that total amalgimatiowas the only thing, or I should have tofind 10 or 12 more officers to do the workof those who were going to A.C.E. If ourvia media were acdepted this would not benecessary. There would be an economy ofstaff and labour and an absence of frictior.I alsoiscussed with Viv. the americansituation and told nim what Kimball had saidto me. I was certi that the situationwould never improve unless there was afirm undertaking observed by all concernednot to operate on behalf of Donovan inHoover's territory oron behalf of Hooverin Donovan's. At the moment SecurityCo-ordination was persona non grata withthe F.B.I. and this atmosphere was vitiatingour liaison. We had analagoas proolemsand wanted a free exchange but for somereason or other althou h we were nowentering the 4th year of war, nothing hadhappened.We also discussed the question OI ISOS. Isaid that it was no good burying our headsin the sand. Th F.B.I. knew about ISOSand were dealing with certa in groups.Before long they would take action on themto our detriment. We should then have toput our cards on the table, when they wouldreproach us for not having done so before.We now had something to barg in with indthought we should be making a great mistaikeif we did not come clean in some form orCatalogue Reference:KVI4/190738another. Viv. then told me that the Presi-dent had given orders thit ISOS was not tobe handed to the F.B.I. I said that thePresident knew no more about ISOS thanthe Archbishop of Canterbury and that some-body ought to tell him that he too was bury-ing his head in tae sand. It was not theslightest use sitting down under that kindof thing, as we could do ourselves andthe Americans nothing but harm by notputting the whole business on a properfooting. He said that the Americans nerecoming down oGlenalmond during the weekand ne would see whit could be done.August 3lstD.G. told me that he:h d sent a copy ofCurry' memo on the 5th column to Duff-CoopeHe will consider the question of Currylooking into the whole matter on hisreturn.I lunched with Brook "ilkinson, after seeingan rmerican film depicting a spy ringin the U.K. The hiefs of Staff, or wha+they described as the Inner IntelligenceCouncil, were shown up asbeing hopelesslyinept, and the Voice of Terror was broad-casting and foretelling acts of sabotagewich were taking place all over the coun-try. finally Sherlock Hdmes and Dr.Watson were called in to put things right.I said that on the whole I should beagainst this being shown though it vasargued that the presence of Sherlock Holmeswould stamp it in the minds of the BritishCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1904239public as being pure invention. I doubtedwhether any but a small section of thepublic would know very much about sherlockHolmes. the impression on their minds wouldbe that the Chiefs ofStaff were hopelesslyinept and that it needed an amateur detectiveto come in and putnthem right. part fromthat it would give a smilar idea to theAmerican forces whom we were tryin toeducate against spy psychosis. There areplenty of people in this country who are ouiquite ready to say that the whole of ourstaff work is bad, as indeed a good deal ofif may be, without their being given anyfurther encouragement. Brook "ilkinson saidthat he would refer the film to TyrrellBnd if the matter was still under disputehe would ask me to coe up again. It seemedfairly eler that the film nad been produeedfor the American public in order to makethey spy-conscious. and not wvishing todepict their own Chiefs ofStaff as ineptthey fobbed this view off on the British.We have had rather an interesting case inCensorship. Mr.J.R. EVERSDEN of Dinsmere,Rockley oad,Godalming, has been writingto Trooper .EVERSDEN, Stalag Bb,Germany.There is one sinister reference in theletter to aunt Mary being pro-German. Thereis no J.R. R.EVERSDEN or any such address atGodalming and there is no P/W known of thatname. It seems possible that this may bea clumsy attempt by someone Here to getinto touch with the Germans. They wouldargue that as Trooper EVEORSDEN did notexist his letter would be opened by someCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190official who would read about huntMary740being pro-German. this would be a signalto the Germans to look out for any similarletters. If this is a correct view theattempt is certainly clumsy. It seemsdoubtful however whether the D/W mail couldbe used with advantage for communicationin S/I since the timne which it takes toreach its destination varies from 6 or 8weeks to 5 months. Stalag 8b has been ofinterest from the point of view of theIrish Brigade.September IstThe D.G. has left for the I.0.M. and Liver-pool. Harker took the.meeting today.The Second Front was discussed. carry Allansaid that the N.O. did not know exactlywhat would be required of the SecurityService but they thought ve should beprepared - for what, they did not at themoment seem to know.Medhurst has written a letter to the D.G.complaining that a Capt.biddell rang up theMinistry of Information last Saturday tosay that .I.5 had information that Oxforawas going to be bombed. AS a result thepolice had been warned and all the FireService, ,A.R.P.,eto etc called out. Medhurstsaid that t is was a serious mtter and thatif ve had any information it snould have beerpassed to him. I rang up Medhurst andexplained the circumstances. He seemedsatisfied. Evidently the C. C. at Uxford aswe expected lost his head.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/190I had a discussion vith Charles about 0.C.I explained that the present situation vasfar from satisfactory. Letters came infrom D.S.0.S addressed personally to theG. and I very rarely saw them until afteraction had been taken and sometimes notat all. I felt that if all D.S.O. corres-pondence could be centralised in Gibbsthings would work much more smoothly. Jelfand Plowman vere really quite useless.Jelf's main asset was thought to be hisstanding with the C.0. In actual fact hisname there was mud. Plovman is a retiredcolonial serv nt who seems to be more orless incapable of understanding the meaningof anything. The only useful m n in O Cis layton. He could well carry theadministrative side.. I felt very stronglythat the initiative on all matters affectingthe D.S.0.S, their postings etc. should comefrom the Intelligence rather th n theAdministration. tor many years the preciseopposite had been the case. Charles entire-lyyagreed with me. We are going to try andget some change. Charles thinks that ifhe could come up to London he would be ableto control these matters far more easily.Gibbs is worried about the Belgian vongo.There is considerable evidence that theGermans are very active in this colony.The Blegian uovt. have little eontrol.over the colonial administrat tyion. Thishas always been so even since before thewar. There is practically no security.The Americans are very active in the Beleianongo and de end upon it to a Large extentCatalogue Reference:KVI4/190742for certain raw materials. It is vitallyimportant tht security measures thereshould be taken in hand.Field-Robinson came to see me about UttoHALLER. HALLER is a F/W whom he wishes touse. He would like us to interrogtte himand give them an opinion. I said that wewould be very pleased to do this if he wouldlet us have copies of the former interrogation. I ropose hat Caroe should seeHALLER.I had a talkwith haylor about S..S. a entsat the R.P.S. Ahe arr ngmenet is that allthe accredited agents should pass throughthe R. S. S.I.S. resent that those whopass through were questioned about theirwork. Haylor's point of view is thatit is impossible to examine these peoplefeom the security angle unless the wholeof their activities and contacts are discussI am inclined to agree, particularly sincete have had to cases of agents comingthrough who have really been double-crossingus or the French. I refer to the casesof Robert PETIN and PELLETIER.September 2ndI took the Wednesday meeting.

He is toland at some suitable open space nearLondon.SeptemberI had a meeting with Stopford,Matthewsand Joe Stephenson about the PAIR FISINGCo. which employs Spanish fisherman andruns boats from Milford Haven which fishoff the coast of Eire. Sometimes the boatsput into Lire ports. The whole set upseems to be extremely undesirable. Werecommended certain action bu't the Navyrefused to support us. It is now proposedthat we should get agents on board theseboats.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/190Frost and I went to see Capt.Sandwith atthe Admiralty about Abwher traffic inS.Africa. He is going on a word tourand will be in touch with Bennett in abouttwo months time. dle volunteered to explainto him our views about the unlikelihood oftheir being any Abwehr stations in SouthAfrica, and about the possible unreliablityof Post ffice workers who would have tobe employed on V.I. work.Haylor and I had a meeting with Viv. aboutthe R.P.S. Viv. was very anxious for usto waive any right to interrogate S.ISagents. We compromised by saying that wedid not wish to see any accredited agents.We felt however that the term should bemore closely defined, particularly whereallied agents were put forward as accreditedagents of S.I.S. aylor pointed out thatadvantages were gained through obtiningparticulars of escape organisations etc.It was agreed that we should write aletter to I.S. on the subject.Hince came to see me. He had seen quitea lot of Grogan, from whom he had gainedvaluable information. In the course ofconversation he mentioned a method employeby the Americans in interrogating. prisonersparticularly criminals of the gangster type.He mentioned a case where two men had beenapprehended for murder. They nad used acar which had subsequently been found.The F.B.1. had published a detailed des-cription of this car and also details ofthe crime. Certain particulars of the carCatalogue Reference:KVI4/190had however been omitted from the pressarticle. they gave the prisoners the papersand when they had rend them they were takenaway, and the prisoners were asked to givea description of the car they had readabout. They were then in the position ofnot knowing exactly what information theyhad got from the papers and hat they knewfrom personal observation. In thisparticular case they committed a majorblunder by deseribing some detail of theinside of the car which had not beenmentioned in the papers. They were unableto ex lain how they knew about it. This isknow as the method of supplied information.I rather doubt whether it is applicableto spy cases but it might be on accasions.Hince said that he would like to have atalk with our pigeon expert about two-waypigeons. The Americans thought that theJaps had been using pigeons on this type.It is apparently quite possible to traina pigeon to fly out to a ship and then comeback to its loft.September 4thDick has seen the F.0. about BARROS. TheSpanish Ambassador is to be told that theF.O. are satisfied that this man wascommunicating with the enemy re movementsof convoys.

It seems however thatanother copy was left behind. After theraid we gave out that the enterprise adbeen satisfactory and that ve had le irnedmany lessons. The Germans in their broad-cast replied that the lessons vere nothingto those they .had learned from the documentswhich we had so kindly left behind.

It is roposethat he should thoroughly investigate thecase of CARLBERG and also erate to thefull his agent in the hotel in Aberdeen,where the pilots stay. GARIBERG, whoseoffice is in London, visits the ierodromeon the arrival and dep rture of plans andcould very well act as a contact man.CARLBERG has recently been asked to takeover the re resentation of INTERAVIA, aninternational company with headcuarters inSwitzerland which colleets informationabout.aircraft all over the yorld. TheGermans are the principal subseribersand there is no doubt that any informationin the hands of INTERAVIA ultinatelygoes to the Germans.September 6thI Saw Lamplough and Caulfeild at the Club.Caulfeild told me that he had just he rdof an incident which mi ht possibly threwsome light on the Faroes case.

The captin had beeninterrogated by the S.0.I. at Fleetnoodand the boat had now left on its returnjourney to iceland.I talked to uamplough about the Gileadis,which we believe had reported the movementsof our rships at St.Johns on the 4th or 5thAugust. Lamplough said that he had heardthat to of our ships had been torpedoedwhile at anchor off St.Johns a few days 1go.I asked him what he thought was the solutionto our problem. He thought the only thingwas to ram the Gileadis which would bespurlos versenkt without survivors.September 7thAt the Press Meeting Tangye reported thatMaisky was giving mildly pessimisticaccounts of Churchills visit to the limes,and trying to dictate a pessimistic versionto the Herald and other papers.

There was tobe a meeting at the W.0. to discuss hisduties. It was suggested that I shouldattend.Dick,Gibbs and t had a discussion aboutWe.Africa.

He had written arather peremptory note to nothschild andsaid he would wish to see the Dorothy casewhen he came up. Fulford seemed rathercomplacent, but I thought that by the endof our talk he was somewhat shaken. Hehad spoken about the flimsy evidence on whicCurry's memo was base.d. 1 said that Idid not think that it was Curry.'s evidencethat was flimsy but rather the evidence ofthose who were supposed to be dealing with-5th column activities. The fact was thatwexe were only scratching the surface andthat we kneIN very little about the inner-most feelings of Germans, duals, B.U.F. andallied nationals. I envisaged that if wewere again faced with the threat of invasionthere would be a spate of jitter broadcastsfrom the continent and probably the droppingof a certai number of parachutists. a fewwires cut here and there would be quitesufficient to start a spy psychosis. It wasquite possible that under such conditionsa good many people of the type revealed bythe Dorothy case might come out of theirholes. It was therefore essential thatwe should know exactly who they were. Fulfosaid that he did not like provocation. Ereplied that it was no good tackling ajob of this sort with Liberal kid gloves.We might not like anything that savouredof agents provocatuers but sueh methods werehecessary in times of crisis. Informationwas obtained which could not be used for thepurposes of prosecution but we should at lealearnwhereCatalogue ReferenCe:KV14/190rulford seemed to-754think that Rothschild was at the bottom ofthe memo. I said that this was not thecase.On Curry's SU estion hothschild had writtena note on the 5th column based on his ease.This had been sent to Stamp, who had triedto tear it to pieces. In reply Miss thererhad written an acrimonious minute, and Ithought that at this stage it Nas better tohand the whole correspondence over to Currvfor arbitration. After study ing theminutes Curry h d written his memo whienwas based on all the avil ble evidencein the office. I did not agree with the-suggestion that the memo should go to theHome Secretary or to any arbitrary increasein the invasion list. It seemed to me thatthe matter was largely a domestic one. We 01ought to investigate more deeply andplace people on the invasion list accordingto the results obtained. Fulford saidthat he was going to study the Dorothy caseand would let me now his vies. I toldhim that if he was proposing to take itover I should object very strongly, firstlyon organisational grounds, since there wereat least two people who could be prosecurunder the Treachery Act for sabotage andespionage, and secondly because tothschildhad handled the ease very suecessfully formore than two years and it would be follyat this stage to move such a complex matterfrom his direction. I told rulford thathaving read his minute on the file, I nadexpected to see him advancing up S.J. on awhite charger brandishing a sword and flushewith his recent triumphs over Col.Alexander.Catalogue ReferEnCe:KVI4/190281Ned tells me that he has been informed byone of the London banks that the sum of 1750was sent by the spanish ambassador inAnkara to Chaman Lal, hewell known Indian.This money was to have gone through abank in Switzerl ind but Ankara apparentlydid- not realise that the transaction couldonly finally be carried out through London.I believe that Chaman Lal does representsome Spanish paper but this would notaccount for the.moeny being remittedfrom Ankara. Ned also tells me that oneGillearo has sent money from Gib. tosix Indians.The D.G. has returned and has asked meabout A.C.E.

Af.ter lunch we hada short talk. Stephenson told Hince andKimball that he had heard they were underthe impression that he (S. ) had been oldingup stuff in New York. They both deniedthis but said that uite clearly informationpassing through New York had not beenreaching ourselves. They expressed satis-faction with their position here and hopedthat things would now move more smoothly.I saw Stephenson for a moment afterwards.He told me that he had had several houswith Duff-Cooper who I gather is in favourof Stephenson holding a mand te for theSecurity Service. There is apparently tobe a meeting tomorrosr on the subject.This ought to work if Stephenson refrainsfrom carrying out operations on his ownin loover's territory. I rather doubthowever whether he will. At any rate itwill be a step forward and if the situationis still unsatisfactory we shall ive topress for our own separate representatioin Americaa.

It was eventually decided that Panshould send a message to lexander intimatinthat his presence was urgently required herein order to discuss certain matters connectewith the Second Front.the Germans are trying to get back SEMMEL AU-ER on an exchange basis.Burt came to see me about the indiseretionsof a certain Major Daubeny who had blabbedabout the Second Front to AUdrey aichmond-Brown. She had mentioned my n ame, presumablyas somebody who might help to get her andher friend out of the mess This would bequite impossible in any case since she alreacommitted herself in a st atement and hashanded over a letter from Daubeny whicn istantamount to an admission of his guilt.The V.C.I.G.S. is very hot on these cases naand there is not much doubt that Daubenywill be cashiered if not orse. Audreyspoke to a Lady Child who spoke to Capt.Lonscale who was P.A. to some General inthe W.O.I went over with the D.G. to see Dufi Cooperabout Stephenson representing us in theCaribbean, and also for the prirpose of liais-son with the F.B.I. I explained to Duffthat i thought Stephenson could carry thisith advantage if he were made our repre-Catalogue ReferenCe:KV/4/190765sentative. Such an arrangement would bringus into closer contact with the F.B.I.and make our connection much more rapid.It could only work satisfactorily howeverif Stephenson was personal grata with theF.B.I. Clearly at the moment he was not.This was due to the fact that he was runningagents in Hoover's area particularly intothe Embassies in Washington. Hoover main-tains that this is his province and thatif we want to knowwhat is going onindiplomatic circles in Washingto we haveonly to ask and ne will give us nythingwe require. I said thought it as muchbetter to accept this offer and to refrainfrom running agents in this manner. Asregards the Caribbean D.G. made it clearthat there were certain matters whichaffected the Colonial Office and whichwould have still to go through London.The R.P.S. report two spies,DYKSTRA and GROOT-VELD.

Ned has also discovered thatCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/190certain Bank of England notes of high denom-ination which were obtained at the beginningof the war by Albert de BARY of Amsterdam,passed through the hands of Prince Paulof Serbia.

S.I.S. undertook to let us knowwhen their accredited agents came throughand where and.when we could see them. whileI do not trust Dansey I do think we mayultimately break down the prejudices of someof his P.Officers if we can get into directtouch with them.

There was somequestion of gettin rid of him altogetherand putting Denh m in his place but hehas dug himself in SO well with wonovanthat he could not be removed without amajor peration and probably a row withthe President. While C. is prepared toagree to the Caribbean arrangment Viv. atany rate was hotly opposed to our comunicating with Stephenson on matters ffeatingthe F.B.I. te pleaded that S.

I said that we could givecopies t S.I.S. of all our communic tionsbut he did not seem to think that this wasa good idea.

The memo which had been draftedby Abbott. needed a good deal of amendmentand struck us all as being somewhatcomplacent. While there is no doubt thatleakage can and probably does take place,we have no concrete evidence of this fact.Censorship has produced nothing, examinationat ports has produced nothing. The Lireauthorities say that they know of nocollecting centre on the other side. Ifsuch an organisation were relying upon thecasual traveller who is only allowe to goover twice a year, it would be necessaryfor it to employ a large number of people ifit was to function rapidly and efficiently.An organisation of this magnitude wouldalmost certainly be detected before long.We therefore presume that either theregular traveller who for business purposeshas a 6 months visa or officials withfast sea or air routes would be the mostlikely people to be employed by the enemy asagents. Stopford is making a special driveon this category. The present port controland port censorship is by no means 100%and it seems doubtful whether, an increaseof staff for these purposes would be reallyjustified. Our evidence such as it isindicates that German agents in the southare mainly concentrating on getting informa-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/190773tion from the north. We have seen signsof a little information of no great impor-tance going out through Italian B.J.S butprobably a good deal more goes out in theGerman telegrams some of which amount to asmuch as 2,000 groups.

He evidently distrustsStephenson and is rather saying "That isthe man to whom you propose to hand youraffairs." Apparently there was no mentionin the D.( G.

Everybody has agreed thatit would be a good thing for tothschild togo out and from our point of view it ishighly necessary. It is now a month sincewe made the original suggestion and he isstill here.I Linched with Tangye and Hyde, the newseasuor of the Evening Standard. Hyde explair-ed his difficulties about making enquiriesas to what was knwon generally in Presscircles about future operations. He saidthat it was perfedly simple to obtain thisinformation through a confidential contact,and I rather gather that he had in factdone SO. He did however admit to me thathe had down nothing of the attack onMadegascar. He said taat the securityarrangements for that operation must havebeen particularly good. When I mentionedthis subsequently to Lennox he Said thatthe cover in an operation of that kind wasnaturally extremely good since troops hadbeen going round the Cape to Suez for a monthA ew more or less did not make muchdifference. I asked Hyde about D.Notices.He told me that at least 10 people in theoffice would know about them before theywere roneod for distribution to those whowould haveto know.

There were certain partsf ISOS relating to this incident whichhe had had great difficulty in elucidating.Curry took him up to see nothschild, whoshowed him the actual bomb and explained tohim the exact meaning of certain parts ofthe messages. He said that all that kindof information was invaluable and asked ifwe could let him know any other particulars.In the ordinary way L should have feltinclined to put the full facts to C. or Viv.but honestly in the present atmosphere 1 donot feel that we should get any where.I should merely be told that the countenanc-ing of irregularities of this sort wasdisloyal and disastrous and the wretchedfellow from G.C. & C.S. whalis sweating hisuts out to do a decent job of work, would ststill be left to languish from Abwehr-starvation.I had a talk with J.C. and T.A.R. aboutthe MULLET case.

Faroes, cameto see me. He painted a rather gloomypicture ofour D.5.0. As far asI can make out, all that warsen does is tocensor the telegrams which go out. He isa heavy drinker and whenever a ship comesin there is always some difficulty infinding him. The general form is to ringup four prostitutes and he is generally tobe found with one of them. Bedford saidthat he is quite a decent fellow but hethinks that it is unfair to leave a mantoo long in the Faroes. There are 25portsfrom which sea-going fishing boats go outand these are situated in different islands.F'rom 50-100 ot these boats are involved.The Faroese police who number 12 are general-ly useless and unreliable. The Norwegianofficiall representatives are quarrellingwith the representatives of the DanishCatafodue Referencekvparreolly reliable personwith whom to make contact. Bedford suspects779Ihlen, a Norwegian espapee who is secretaryto the Norwegian consulate and has consider-able fishing interests. He arrived pennilessin the islands and is now quite wealthy.It is estimated that his bill for drinkalone must come to something like 150 amonth. One interesting fact emerged. Ihlenis in the habit of making a careful studyof all foreign broadcasts. This he admitsfreely to all his friends. It may betherefore that he listens carefully to theKMD broadcasts which are supposed to denotethe movements of submarines. Ihlen wasapparently at one time in trouble with theNorwegian Govt about his accounts. I amproposing (a) to recommend the removalof Larsen and (b) some enquiry with theNorwegians about Ihlen. We shall then haveto consider what we shall do in the Farces.September 21stI had a long conversation with Viv. aboutAmerica. He has written turning down myproposal for feferring our communicationsto New York to Section V. before despatchand still thinks that all such communica-tions should go through Section V., butsuggests that we might draft our own tele-grams and letters. The present systemmight ork if we were in the same buildingand the American Section of Section V.was efficient. But we know that in factit is not. Moreover Viv. has admitted asmuch and told me that Cowgill has beenseriously concerned about the matter for along time. The fact is that we cannot goCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190150on indefinitely. Nothing could possibly beworse than the present arrangement and whatwe are proposing would be infinitely bettereven if the lines did get crossed fromtime to time.I had a meeting at Kinnaird House aboutIreland. Capt. Altham, the Admiralty Censor-ship representative, got rather excitedabout what he described as the lack ofsecurity measures at the ports. Thisaroused the D.G., who gave him a raspberryAltham was asked to give us any evidence ofleakage but clearly he had none. I talkedto him afterwards and explained more or lesswhat we were doing with regard to placingagents on ships. He seemed fairly satis-fied. The general feeling of the meetingwas that the present measures were in allthe circumstances as adequate as could beexpected.Janson of N.I.D. is probably going up tothe Faroes and will give us a report onhis impressions.Bailey of New York came to see me aboutour communications underthe new arrangement.He had been to see Jelf but said that hehad never found anybody who knew less orwas likely to know less about any arrangementof the kind. I said that our idea wasto communicate in one-time table, that theposition of Stephenson as representing theSecurity Service in the Caribbea area hadbeen settled but that S.I.S. were stilljibbing about our have direct communicationCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190781on matters which affected ourselves and theF.B.I. Bill Stephenson called in a littlelater. He said that he understood thatthis matter had been settled. I explainedthat he was under a misapprehension. Ihad thought So too when we drank a glassof port to celebrate the new arrangementbut that during the course of that after-noon I had been disillusioned, after seeingC. and Viv. Stephenson thinks we shouldhave direct communication and can see noharm in it. I spoke to him again aboutthe F.B.I. and ISOS.I said that I was stillin ignorance about what had been decided.He said that as far as he knew no fiathad been given in the U.S.A which gave ONI exexclusive rights. He thought now that acommittee had been formed at which ONI,G2,Coastguards,F.B.. anf F.C.C. were allrepresented, this matter could be fairlyeasily settled. He was all in favourof coming clean to the F.B.I. This is alsoBailey's view.September 22ndForrest came to see me about a talk thathe was proposing to give to the specialBranches in his area. He had been askedto say what exactly was expected of thepolice in the matter of catching spies.Hewas inclined to tell them that exceptin the case of parachutists or people landingillicitly in rubber boats, there was littlethey could do without guidance from ourselveswho had special sources of information. ICatalogue Reference.kV/471gosaid that roughly I thought this1<7was correct. On the other hand we didexpect the police to know as much aspossible about subversive elements and aliensin their rea and that it was not sufficientin our view for them to say that a man hadnot come to adverse notice. It wasnecessary as far as possible to obtainpositive evidence of a man's bona fidesor otherwise. This could only be doneeffectively through a network of inform-ants who had made actual contacts with thethe suspects.I attended the D.G.S meeting. CharlesButler told us that the emergency accommo-dation which had been earmarked for us inthe event of S.J. being bombed had now beenallotted to someone else. At the momentwe were therefore without any emergencyheadquarters. He was taking the matter upwith the Office of Works. I said thatas the Service Depts. all had something inthe nature of a battle headquarters, we aughtto have something of a similar kind, andthat it would be useless to move intoany old building which was not properlywired up to all offices with which wewere in normal contact. My remarks appearedto fall on stony ground.Curry caused slight constern tion by announc-ing that he thought that officers of theSecurity Service were not sufficientlyinformed about the German Intelligenceervice and mentioned the Sicherheitsdierst.It was quite clear from the look on every-Catalogue Reference:KVI4/190783one's face that none of them had everheard of the SHD or had the slightest ideawhat it was. Only Kenneth Younger washonest enough to say So. I took theopportunity of pointing out that thiswas a matter of some importance, particularlyto Kellar who was by way of dealing withthe Middle East, butwas not in B. and alsoto Ramsbotham. The D.G. seemed to thinkthat Kellar was solely concerned withpolitical movements and when I said that hewas really the only recipient in the officeoutside ISOS of information regarding theMiddle East, the D.G. more or less said thatthe Middle East could look after itself.He was evidently quite determined that noalteration in the status quo was necessary.The position is of course that Kellar andRamsbotham are intimately connected withthe ISOS but are located in a divisionwhich has nothing to do with ISOS. Kennethsaid that Ramsbotham was able to deal,under Dick's guidance, with the Americancases and carry his security liaison as wellbecause SO little data had up to the presentbeen received from the United States. ifhowever as a result of our improved relationswith the F.B.1. information was going toflow more freely, he would have a full timejob in dealing with it and somebody elsewould have to take on his security duties.T.A.R. talked to me about more use beingmade of his D.A.experts throughout theEmpire. He had India particularly in mind.He told me that Peter Fleming was on hisway back fnom India and I suggested thatCatalogue Reference:KV/4/190144he might wait and have a talk with him. Inthe mean time he might get in touch withVickery and get his views on how far theD.A. system as operated here could beapplied to India. Anybody going out wouldobviously have to work in very close con-tact with D.I.B.I had a meeting with Dick and Curry aboutbringing Curry's work on the Abwehr upto date. Hart and Gwyer feel that it isdifficult to deal with subjects such asthe Middle East and the Iberian Peninsulawithout the detailed knowledge which mustbe reposing in Section V. it would 1 thinkin present circumstances be impossible toaske Section V. to make a further contri-bution since they are SO hard-worked andunder-staffed. Their previous contributionswere not worth very much. We decided thatit would be best to write up special sub-jects such as the Wirwehitschaf't, Sicherheits-dienst, Technische Luftwaffe, and also new trtrends in the various areas, e.g. the use oftrawlers in the Atlantic, the Sofia Melde-kopf etc. In another 6 months it was tobe hoped that Section V. would be in abetter position to make a contribution.We also considered the desirability ofgetting the Middle East to report in moredetail on their own affairs. I said that Idoubted whether they would ever get anopportunity of standing back and survey ingthe whole workings of the Abwehr in theirarea. They were probably engaged the wholetime in taking ad hoc action.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/190785In the evening I went down to Tring withVictor and Duff-Cooper. He talked to meabout A.C.E. He said that he had only takena cursory glance at the papers. He thoughtthe D.G.S letters were admirable and that outcompleints were really justifiable. Heevidently did not think much of C's replies.He said that clearly all three organisationsshould be under one head and in one office,but that this was an ideal which could notbe realised in present circumstances. Theonly thing to do therefore was to make themachine work as smoothly as possible byminor adjustments. He thought that it wouldbe difficult to uproot Glenalmond and thattherefore we should make a gesture by send-ing people down there. In return for thiswe should get adequate guarantees from themthat in future we should get all we wantedand as rapidly as possible. I said that Iwas absolutely certain that operating fromthe country only led to stagnation. I wasconvinced that Glenalmond could move notonly without dislocation but with consid-erable advantage to itself and that a goodmany of the workers there were similarlyconvinced. I thought that the via mediawhich we had suggested would be a good stepsince nobody would relinquish any of theirpresent nresponsibilities, but things wouldbe speeded up and friction avoided. I donot think that communication would necessar-ily present any great difficulties sincelines that we were now using to Glenalmondwould be available for them to use forcommunicating with their registry etc.CatalogueReference:kV74/190Asmregards their they could bring
