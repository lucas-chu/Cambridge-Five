THE DOCUMENT IS Male PUBLIC A UNDER COPY RECORDS RETAINED 2o00 SECTIONCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18638MARCH lstI have put in a memo about office organisa-tion, increase of staff etc. It looks as ifwe should want at least another dozen officersand a great deal of equipment. We were justabout to make a further demand on the Trea-sury which will now have to be doubled. Aninteresting point in our budget is that itcosts 2125 to turn down a man or womanfor confidential employment.Bland has written from the Hague urging thatsomething should be done about Best andStevens in view of the threatened publictrial, as the result of which they willprobably both be shot. V.V. asked me whetherwe had anybody whoinwe could put upfor exchange or for counter-measures.Unfortunately there is nobody very suitable.It is also quite lear that theGovernmentwould not embark on a policy of reprisals.Maude has gone to Cupar to investigate thecase of the woman SINAGOGA. This woman wastaking down the names of the ships on whichvarious sailors are serving and which sheobtai ned by questioning them when theyentered her shop. In one instance a shiphad been sunk within 24 hours. She hadacted quite openly but it seemed possiblethat she might have been passing theninforma-tion quite innocently to someone else.T.A.R. is investigating the case of a curioustelephone message to one FRANKLAND.N.I.D. have informed us that a certainO'KEEFE who is the representative of theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186Hamburg-Amerika Line in Limerickhas been approached by the German Ministerin Dublin regarding the carrying of secretmails. It is significant that prior to thisapproach O'KEEFE was paid a sum of 2800 whichwas owing to him from the Hamburg-AmerikaLine. The Minister's request has been turneddown.Food parcels are being sent to Poland andthe security aspect of this matter has arisen.We have arranged (1) that application is tobe made on a form giving full particularsthe form to be counter-signed by a barristeror doctor ete. (2) all packages to be care-fully examined (3) no person is to send aparcel more than once in 3 months, and (4)all parcels are to be held by censor for atleast one weekMARCH 2ndThere has been a letter from Hankey stating thathe has looked into the affairs of S.I.S. and thathe has now been ordered by the Prime Minister to investigate the activities of M.I.5. He would like in thefirst instance to have a rough chart covering ourvarious duties. Having studied this he would liketo discuss the departinent in all its aspects withthe officers concerned.Lord Redesdale has asked whether he can have apermit for himself and Lady R. and Unity Mitford toreside on his Island of Inchkennith, which froinMarch 15th onwards will be declared a protectedplace. The Admiralty are taking a rather strongline. They say that the island is not importantin itself since it is not situated on any of theordinary highways, but that since Lord R. has amotor-launch which can easily visit, other places,they think it highly undesirable that Unity shouldbe allowed to reside there. D.S.S. has taken thismatter up with the S. of S. for War who does notCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18633propose to let any of the family go to Inchkennith.Arrangements have been made for a representative ofthe 2eme Bureau to come over here to discuss theARNHEIM case.March 3rdSpecial material: The new Persian minister hastold the Shah that he is extremely impressed withthe calm and confidence which prevails in London.In this respect he draws a distinction between thesituation in England and in France.Noxway and Sweden seem to have a tacit understandingabout volunteers to Finland but they want things tobe done quietly since if there is publicity itmay be as, detrimental to our case as to theirs.Certain plans drawn up by the Turkish experts regar-ding the general mobilisation of Turkey and Iranin certain eventualities ?Russian aggression)have leaked to the Russians. There is greatanxiwty about this in Iranian circles.There are certain indications that things may beworking up to an offensive in the West.T.A.R. has returned from investigating the FRANKLANEcase. The mysterious telephone calls from Dublinand elsewhere were due to the fact that FRANKLANDis an astrologist.March 4thI had a talk with D.D.S. about French travel. Heproposes to make a stand at the conclusion of theproceedings of the Travel Committee. If they donot agree to the 350 a day quota he ywill say thatthe measures suggested do not provide reasonablesecurity and that he will have to acquaint theService Depts. with the factsCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186Sefton Cohen has telephoned about the case of oneS.Norman MARTIN. This man had a pass speciallyprinted for Chatham Dockyard. The printer informedthe police. They interviewed MARTIN, who admittedthat it wa S a foolish act but that his onlyobject had been to enter the dockyard to obtain work.In the meantime realising his mistake he haddestroyed the pass. Nothing was known againstMARTIN by the local police or ourselves, and SeftonCohen was not anxious to prosecute. I discussedthe matter with D.S.S. who decided that MARTIN'Soffence was a serious one in time of war and thathe should undoubtedly be dealt with. D.S.S. SOinformed Sefton Cohen.Maude has returned from Scotland and aftera thorough investigation is satisfied thatMarie SINAGOCA is quite innocent. The localPolice are also satisfied. She produced apiece of paper on which she had noted thenames of the ships and said that she had doneit purely out of interest and had not trams-mitted the information to anybody.CARP and de VOOGT have turned up again atLympne. By some mistake they managed to geta visa at The Hague on production of an oldletter from Admiral Tyres and a new one fromSir Reginald Charry. They said that theywere coming to suggest that they shouldconstruct fast motor boats for theAdmiralty in this country. We consultedAdmiral Tyres who said that he had had nofurther correspondence with these peopleand that he hoped he would never see themagain. The Home Office eventually decidedto send them back.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186March 5th.I discussed this morning with D.S.S. andD.D.S. the question of compiling a Black Listto be used by the Permit Office. At themeetings of the Travel Committee Stafford hasbeen urging that we should supply him withsuch a list. I pointed out that any list ofthe kind could not in present circumstancesbe of much value and was bound to be mis-Leading. We could provide a long list ofCommunists, Fascists, members of the PeacePledge Union, etc. but since in accordancewith present policy, or the lack of it, allthese cases had to be treated on their merits,with the result in the case of Communists thatthey were almost invariably allowed to leavethe country, the work involved in compilingthese lists would largely be a waste of time.The list could only cover members of thesevarious organisations who were already knownto us. Those of whom we had an odd trace, ofnot sufficient significance in itself towarrant placing a man on the list, would not beshow, although in fact that might be just asimportant. It is really the fact that theman desires to travel to a certain destination,coupled with the insignificant trace, thatmakes him interesting.I have discussed with Janson the case ofLeading Seaman LAMM of H.M. Trawler "ReightonWyke". Before going to sea this man leftcertain of his effects with a Mrs WEATHERSTONEof Grantham, who runs a local canteen. Theseincluded a document rolled up in a piece ofbrown paper. He stated that this documentrelated to the Firth of Forth and that hewould tell her about it when he returned.If,Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186however, he did not return by the 7th, wouldshe destroy it. Mrs WEATHERSTONE subsequentlyexamined the parcel and found it to contain asecret chart of the Firth of Forth which,though out of date, still contained a gooddeal of confidential information. Shereported the fact to a naval officer whoconfiscated the chart. It was arrangedthrough the Fleet Base Security Officer andthe Police that Seaman LAMM should have thechart returned to him when he came backand that he should then be followed andarrested.I lunched today with D.S.S. and Newsam. Wediscussed the Travel Committee and I triedto impress Newsam with the importance of theWhole matter from the Security angle. Hewas, however, full of the politicalimportance of acceding to the French requestthat Great Britain and France should be madeas one country. He thought that anything inthe nature of a travel quota would be un-workable. He then said that nothing couldpossibly stop people from making applicationsto the Permit Office. I disagreed with himthere. I thought that if a responsibleMinister could broadcast to the effect thatunnecessary travel was not in the nationalinterest, and the reasons were explained,there would be a general response, and thematter might also be worked up by the Press.There was, I felt, a tendency in matterssuch as these to say that the public wouldnot stand this or that whereas in actual factthe public were quite ready to accept anunpleasant situation if they were asked to doSO by some responsible person It was quiteclear to me that in so far as this office isconcerned we shall get little relief from theTravel Committee.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186THIS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3883 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958.2oooCanning has received a Letter from the HomeOffice asking him to submit a report aboutCommunist finances. He thinks that weshall probably know more about this than hedoes. I have arranged for Roger to go overand see him.The Civil Defence Committee, composed ofthe Home Secretary in the Chair and otherMinisters of the Crown, have been dis-cussing subversive movements and sugges-tions for counter-propaganda. The minutesof one of their meetings have reached us byaccident in a B.M. sent over by the WarOffice for information. It is quite clearfrom the discussion that most of thoseattending the mesing were very much at seaand were attaching significance to allsorts of incidents which were comparativelyunimportant. The Minister of Labour, forexample, was very concerned about what hedescribed as an increase of Communistactivity in Exeter. At the conclusion ofthe meeting the Minister of Information wasasked to prepare a paper on counter-propaganda. It seems amazing that mattersof this sort should be discussed and actionsuggested without any reference to thisDepartment, which has been studying allthese movements in the greatest detail formany years. I have suggested to D.S.S.that he should point this out to the HomeOffice and propose to them that if theMinister for Information is preparing apaper, a member of his staff might beinstructed to establish contact with our-selves.V.V. has asked me to facilitate the entryCataloglieReferenie;kvasg forwho was workingThe Brazilians havesaid that if he is not removed they willmake trouble.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958.2000The M.I.8. code people here have brokenanother of the German codes in use betweenGermany and Luxembourg or Germany and France.The messages seems to relate to Frenchagents and should be extremely interestingand important.The Air Ministry have a scheme by whichjournalists are taken on conducted toursround aerodromes. These people are vetted byus and a Communist has been discoveredacting as a representative for Reynolds. Itseeins undesirable that a man of this sortshould have facilities for touring our aero-dromes. It raises rather an akward situatianfor the Air Ministry but we are recommendingthat the permit should be refused.March 6th.Special material of the 27th February showsthat the Finns have made a request to theFrench for assistance depending on a throughpassage being given by Norway and Sweden.The Soviet are making peace proposals.Special material of the 29th February showsthat the Finnish position is T HAE gettingdifficult. We appear to have promised theCatalde Rererencegy4/pa6t RefePer 50, the end of the month andyti, talking to Holma,360Finnish Minister in Paris, said he could nothold out unless he got 200,000 men.On the 1 st March the French reported thatHalifax subordinated his views on theFinnish situation to the degree of Finnishwillingness to make an official stand. TheFinns seem reluctant to make an officialappeal for assistance in case this wouldprecipitate German action. There is possibeindication that the C.I.G.S. is against theplan of intervention in Finland onstrategical grounds.On the 2nd March Halifax saw Grippenbergand was shocked by news of the seriousplight of the Finns. He said that Finnishmilitary experts had assured us that theycould hold out at least another three orfour weeks even if Viipuri fell. Daladierhas apparently spoken to Chamberlain andsaid that if Finland is not given help asplanned he will resign. Holma, theFinnish Ambassador in Paris, reports thatTanner, Finnish Foreign Minister, iswavering. Holma is therefore sending allhis wires to the Prime Minister Reyti.At 9.15 p.m. on the 3rd March the Swedishand Norwegian Ministers learned that aformal request had been made on the 2ndMarch that the British and French should beallowed to march through Norway and Sweden.Gripenberg had the impression that ourforces of 12,000 men were to go throughregardless of the views of either Norway orSweden.Special material of 29th February shows thatItaly and Turkey are working for some kindof rapprochement between Egypt and Italy.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186361It is felt, however, that the suggestion maynot be favourably received by Egypt.The "Bergersfjord", a Norwegian boat boundfrom New York to Christiania, has beenbrought in with 517 mail bags (17 diplomatic)which had not been declared. She was tryingto run the blockade.Certain officers who make outside enquirieshave raised the question of theircredentials if challenged. It is obviouslyundesirable that they should produce a pinkpass signed by D.S.S.

Patrioticinstincts, a realisation of the consequencesof defeat and a determination that Englandmust be brought to her knees, have resultedin increased support for Hitler. There isconfidence in ultimate victory and a beliefthat Russian cooperation would eventuallyprove effective. Hence time is on Germany'side unless the Allies upset calculationsabout the Russians. The army is behindHitler and there is no chance of any changeunless it suffers a reverse.There are rumours of an approach by Russiato Turkey and a suggestion that possibletalks previously broken off should beresumed.S.I.S. material from Italy indicates thatthe policy against the Jews has been relaxed.It was originally enforced in order to curryfavour with the Moslems.

Mussolini,Parranici and Starace are still inclined tostdek to the Axis but with reservations.Those in favour of a break are Ciano, Grandi,Balbo and the King.I dined with Maude and Rothschild last night.We had a long discussion about sabotage. Heis quite ruthless where Germans are con-cerned, and would exterminate them by anyand every means. He outlined our problem ashe saw it. He thought we should first tryand classify our vulnerable points andfactories in this country and place them ingroups. We should then get the opinions ofsome of the managers as to how it would beCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186possible to put the works out of action ordamage the products without undue risk ofdetection. The methods would have to befairly simple ones which could be carriedout by any of the employees. We shouldthen go to the chemical expert and find outwhat they could do by subtler methods.Having established these facts we shouldsuggest counter-measures and also lay downcertain guiding lines for diagnosis whentrouble occurred. Rothschild thoughtthat to put such an organisation on aproper footing it would be necessary tohave the services of someone with a fairlycomplete knowledge of the scientific world.Scientists were generally specialists in arather narrow field and to obtain theproper advice it was necessary to knowexactly where to go. He would aaso advisethe employment of an engineer. With theremainder of the staff one would have tosee how things developed. In addition tochemical sabotage we discussedbacteriological warfare. He said thatProfessor Topley, who is an e xpert in thesematters, had been rather disappointed bythe lack of enthusiasm expressed by M.I.5.in the early stages of the war and thatthere was in fact a feeling in the newlyconstituted C.I.D. Committee that M.I.5.were neglecting their duty by nottackling the problem. He was very anxiousthat I should see Elliott of the C.I.D.and discuss the matter. Rothschildmentioned the existence of a rocket bombknown as the U.P. bomb. I gather thatthis is a somewhat epoch making inventionbut whether it has reached the productionstage or not is not clear. It is the firstthat I have heard of it but it may ofcourse be known to the D. branches. It isCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18636obviously desirable that every possible stepshould be taken to prevent a leakage aboutthis information to the Germans. We shallprobably find that it is being made in asmall tin shack in a corner of a field andthat anybody can get inside with the aid ofa tin opener.D.D.S. has put up. another mnemo to the TravelCommittee on general security principles.He recommends publicity in the -Press and inParliament re the undesirability ofunnecessary travel.

Hedoes not believe in an invasion of Holland, orBelgiun, but thinks that had we intervened inFinland Germany would have gone into Scandinavia.U.35 wa.s very struck by the contrast between theGerman and British Legations at Berne. At theGerman he found feverish activity, piles ofleaflets and propaganda of one kind or another.At the British, he found Torr sitting vell downin his chair, his head back and his finger-tipstogether in clerical fashion. U.35 wished to seethe Ambassador and for quarter of an hour Torr hadtried to disuade him. Eventually, pointing tothe ceiling, he said "The Ambassador is up there.Perhaps you will excuse me from taking you upbut my left leg has gone to sleep."

There has howeverbeen another hitch with the Assistance to theEnemy Act. The previous difficulty was that theArmy Council said that they did not wish to carryout the execution of a man unless he had beentried under Court Martial. It has now been decidedthat enemy aliens and army officers can be triedby Court Martial. Neutrals and other Britishubjects should be tried by a ivilicourt. TheBills was presented to the Home Office, but theHome Secretary took the view that the definition of"assistance to the enemy" was too wide and thatthe a Bill would never get through the House.It was argued that if it could be shown that a manhad sold a pair of socks to the enemy the Judgewould have no option but to sentence him to death.There was however alviays the safeguard that theHome Secretary could whittle down the sentence toa fortnight's imprisonment if he SO desired, andno prosecution could be instituted without thefiat of the Attorney General. hisfapparently notsufficient and we have been asked to submitanother draft, defining espionage more precisely.March 19thJohn Maude has been going into the case of the sO-called "jitter" reports.

The purpose was todiscuss primarily the case of Soag Machine ToolMakers and in general the cases of Germans employedon arament work here. We maintained that theemployment of Gennans in the supply of machine toolsto our arnament industry. gave the enemy great opporrtunities for obtaining information over a wided.field, and that it was not difficult for themtransiit the information so obtained to Gemnany.The-detection of the acquisition of such informationwas not possible because the Germans in question hadevery right to do So in the legitimate course oftheir business. Detection of the transmission of sucsuch information to Germany was virtually impossible.The Security Service were therefore anxious to seeall Germans in this position interned and wished toknow whether if they were interned, any vitaldamage would be done to production. The GermanForeign Office circular which was recently sent tomansLegation in Dublin, was read. It was pointedout that it laid down that Germans in importantpositions with enemy firs in neutral countriesmight remain if it vas useful to Germany that theyshould do SO. It was also mentioned that enemyfirms might be used for espionage purposes.Admiral Brown had in the first instance beeninclined to minimise the dangers but GeneralTaylor evidently seemed to feel that the case ofthe Security Service had been made out. AdmiralBrown consulted Mr. Rouse, head of the machine toolknown section, the on German the telephone. employees - of Rouse Soag said for many that he years hadand that he regarded them as thoroughly reliable.With all due respect we submitted that such atestimonial was not really worth very much. AdmiralBrown felt bound to agree, and seemed to appreciatethe fact that a firm with the ramifications of SoagCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186388would not have much difficulty in passing outinformation. After general discussion on thevarious aspects of the matter Admiral Brown saidthat the position was that if the Security Serviceconsidered that grave risks were being run, theywould take steps for these Gernans to be interned.General Taylor's sumning up of the situation wasthat it wa.s decided that the security servicewould move for the internment and that if theH.O. did not agree to the internment or if they wereinterned and released as a result of the advice ofthe Advisory Committee, the Ministry of Supplyshould issue a general warning to all concernedthat there sho ld be no dealings with these Geransor German firms apart from the actual purchase ofthe machine tools. They should not be called infor consultation or allowed to have access to shopsand factories.

They are those who criticise theGerman alliance.The question of sending German experts to organiseRussian forces in the Caucasus was in abeyance onFeb. b.28th. The Russians were afraid of this move bbeing regarded as other than a defensive one.They thought it might provoke counter-action whichmight be undesirable in view of the prepared stateof the country. A Norwegian report states thatGoering was encouraging the Swedes to give supportto the Finns as long as they did not do SO inconjunction with the Allies. In such a caseGerany would intervene.There was a meeting here today between Col.Worledge, Commander Dennison,B.3. Mr.Gill andother cypher experts.

While talking to a friend inN.I.D. who deplored the fact that British Shipscould not enter Irish ports, CARRIGAN said thathe had considered this question and had come to theonclusion that there might be an approach to theEire Govt. on historical lines via the French.He had in mind raising an Irish Brigade whichwould be associated with the French Ary. Fromthis would follow the taking over by the Frenchof patrol activities on the north and west coastsof Ireland. Once the French managed to get insideIrish ports it would not be long before the Englishwould be able to do likewise. The idea has beenput to Winston who thought it interesting.CARRIGAN has also seen Eden. It does not seemhowever that any Govt.department would move inthe matter owing to its extreme delicacy. On theother hand if CARRIGAN could bring it about onhis own nobody would mind. CARRIGAN was in touchin Ireland with one Shamus O'CONNOR, a great friendof his father's and one of the original members ofthe Irish Republican Brotherhood. O'CONNOR seemsto like the idea and feels that it might appealto De V. and his colleagues, who are really ratherat their wit's end.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1863011John Booth came to see me this evening. He gaveme an amusing account of his experiences as acorporal in the 5th Bn. of the Scotss Guards.He described the various incidents from the timethat he wa.s approached in France to the momentwhen he was disbanded on the Polish liner atGlasgow. At one moment he was told that everythingwa.s extremely secret and the next he found everybodywas talking about it. The word "Security" hadnever been mentioned until two men were cour'temartialled for talking loudly in an hotel aboutthe date of their departure to Chamonix. TheColonel then had the whole battalion up andtold them they would suffer the same fate if theydid not keep their mouths shut. On the returnjourney the censorship was removed at Southampton wiwith the result that every man wrote full detailsabout the expedition to his family, which he postedat Birmingham. The censorship was not reimposedtill the troops were on board at Glasgow.

By Feb. theywere standing at 8,776 for Scotland and England.Mrs. .Vyvian ADAMS, Ministry of Information (Intelli-gence Dept) has written to us to know whether we cangive her some assistance regarding subversive move-ments as she has to prepare a paper for her Ministerto present at the Civil Defence Committee meetingnext Wednesday. This is evidently the result of myprotest to Tudor and the letter sent by Maxwellto the P.U.S. at the Ministry of Inforation.The first reaction herewas to say that we wouldnot supply this lady with any information and thatour normal channel was through the H.O. PersonallyI feel this attitude is perhaps a little difficultto maintain. What we really want to do is to seethat our information gets to the Cabinet Ministerswho have to make decisions about matters directedagainst subversive movements.I have had an extraordinary conversation withNewsam about communists and French travel. Iexplained to him that every commuRist must beregarded as an enemy agent or at least a potentialone and that therefore vet were not anxious to seethese people travelling abroad.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/186393Newsam exprrssed great surprise and said that ifwe really felt that way he thought the matter shouldbe put up to the S. of S.. T said that as far aswe were concerned we regarded the deduction aselementary. The liaison between the two Intelli-Rasvagence Services had existed since 1923 although ithad perhaps been somewhatthin from 1935-39. Thelink nevertheless remaine and we must thereforeassume even in the absence of confirmatory informatithat anything that went to the communists ulti-mately reached the Germans if it wa.s likely tobe of any use to them. I told Newsam that in ac-tual fact we had confirmation of the presentliaison from several sources. He then tried tomake out that there was no harm in communistsgoing to France as the French would look afterthem probably far better than we could. I saidthat was all right in theory but in actual prac-tice there was nothing to stop these people fromcommunicating with the enemy across the Belgianfrontier, which had recently been visited by twoof our officers. Although of course the SovietEmbassy bag, which we knew wa.s being used, was amore convenient channel for communicating,there were certain cases where personal contact hadto be made. Newsam then said that if we reallytook this view about comnunists, he really couldnot see why we were worrying very much about therefugees, to which I replied that if the enemyhad one good source of information, it wouldnot mean that they would turn down another.March 22ndThe French have asked us to arrest a Cuban ladynamed Canomares ESTRADA, employed by the ArgentineConsulate at Manchester. They have a warrant forher arrest and suspect also the Consul. Theinformation reached us from G.H.Q. and was somewhatlacking in detail. It seemed quite obviousCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18639asthat we could not arrest the woman ithout somesort of evidence, neither could we get a deporta-tion order against her. As it was then late,I arranged that we should first discover whetherthe lady had an exit permit and if so, issueinstructions to ports to have her stopped.It was found that she had no exit permit, andarrangements have been made whereby she will notget one without reference.March 23rdHad a half-day. I asked S.I.S. to obtain furtherparticulars about ESTRADA from the 2eme Bureau.March 2lthWinchester.March 25thHad a further discussion with Harker and D.S.S.about Mrs. ADAMS.

I also raised againthe question of sabotage, concerning which ourduties are still indefinite.The Irish station transmitting in German diplomaticcode has been active again somewhere between Dublinand Wicklow.March 26thThe case of Ulysses BYWATER, brother of Hector,has caused a certain amount of trouble. Ulyssesapplied for an exit permit to visit his relativesin Switzerland. In actual fact it was hisintention to go through Germany on the pretextof a visit to his son who is the American Vice-Consul at Danzig, in order that he might writeup conditions in Germany for the Daily Express.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1863957BYWATER, though born in this country is a naturalisedAmerican citizen and travels with an Americanpassport. He is now back in Paris and has made anurgent request for a visa to return to this country.Meanwhile his brother Hector, who is agitating onhis behalf, has been told that Ulysses has committedan offence under D.R. 17 and that we do not considerit would be fair to facilitate his return to thiscountry until the position is cleared up. The DailyExpress meanwhile are doing their best to disown him.It has been decided to allow M. CAMU of the BelgianCivil Service to come here to discuss counter-espionage matters. He is apparently charged bythe Belgian Prime Minister to effect the amalgamationof the Surete Nationale and the Belgian 2eme Bureauand he wants the benefit of our experiences. Ithas been decided that we will see him with a repre-sentative of S.I S. and that we will confine ourselvesto explaining our relations with the police,Immigration Authorities etc. In so far as S.I.S.are concerned we shall not say more than thatPassport Control Officers maintain a liaison withfriendly police forces in order to assist them intheir duties of granting visas.The Home Secretary has decided that Ben FRANCISwho has passed through the Lenin School and acted asa Gomintern courier, should be allowed to proceed to.Ireland as a representative of the Daily Workerwith a party of other journalists who are toaccompany the Minister of Supply. This decision wasarrived at after consultation between the Home Officeand Ministry of Supply, the latter ting thatnothing of a secret or confidential nature would beseen by the party. I made it clear to Newsam thatwe did not approve of the action and that we regardedFRANCIS as an enemy agent. Later I telephoned toWickham of the R.U.C. and asked him to look afterFRANCIS who was arriving the following morning. Hetold me that tere was a good deal of ill-feelingCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186316in Belfast about the visit of the Minister ofSupply and the establishment there of a branch ofthe department. All the important factories muchpreferred to deal direct with the Service Departmentsconcerned and regarded the organisation as a wasteof time and money. Wickham thought that it wasprobable for this reason that Harland Wolff andHarland Shortts had refused to allow any of thejournalists to enter their work. The party wereapparently to visit one shell-making factory ofminor importance.A message has reached us through the D.O. thatUNLAND is to visit a representative of Harland Wolff.All the wheels have been set in motion.Harker has seen Mrs. V yvian ADAMS and told her tha'tnormally we supply all our information through theH.O. but that if she cares to consult us on certainmatters we should be quite ready to give her the benefitof our advice.March 27thSlade of N.I.D. spoke to me today about his liaisonwith Wickham through a Naval Officer in N.Ireland.This came about through Gilfillan's informationconcerning red lights seen off Donegal. TheAdmiralty acted on this information and believed thatthe signals had something to do with a rendez-vousfor German submarines. They say that they were notvery certain about their observations however as therewere So many whales in the area at the time!Slade says that Wickham is looking round for an officerhet-sheuhe-be-delighted-te who has some German bacl-ground. I said that we thoroughly realised thenecessity for such an officer and should be delightedto give Wickham any assistance. I have spoken toCecil and suggested that he should if possiblegoover to Ulster and see Wickham.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/186397The Drogheda I.R.A. station has been active againat 16 hours on the 24th. We have told Archer.It has been established that Mrs. KRAFT is in touchwith ERTZ HORSFALL.I had a rather disappointing interview with Hankey.He said he thought he had not seen me since theenquiry into our activities at the Yard and that hehad often wondered what had become of me and how thetransfer of the organisation to M.I.5. had workedout. I said that I thought it had been verysatisfactory. He then asked if I had ever heard whatthe Yard thought about it. I said that I had no verydefinite information, but that I rather understoodthat if the transfer had been suggested a month laterLord Trenchard, who was just taking over, would haveraised strong bjections, as without an Intelligenceorganisatio he felt himself somewhat in the air.Lord Hank y then asked me about communist and Fascistorganisations. I explained to certain pointsabout the penetration of the P.P.U. by the NordicLeague and the B.U.F., and how it was that suchorganisations, which in themselves were perfectlyreputable, were often made use of by extremistorganisations of the Right or Left. He then saidthat he had to see a great many people and had nofurther questions to ask. My whole interrogationdid not take more than 5 or 10 minutes. T had hopedthat I might have had some opening to discuss whatare really our difficulties.Newsam spoke to me about the new orders forProtected Places. He wanted to know if it would besufficient from our pont of view if the C.C.s wereto satisfy themselves as far as possible as to thebona fides of any individual who wished to obtaina permit to enter a protected place for a few hours.The alternative was to carry out elaborate enquirieswhich would obviously take time.

He has been ordered byHankey to go to France in order that he may discusswith his opposite nubers questions relating tobacteriological warfare. He wanted to know whetherhe should take the opportunity of finding out what theFrench are doing generally with regard to sabotage.I said I thought that this would be an excellent plan,and promised to discuss it with the General and lethim know. I introduced Rothschild to Archer.Rothschild had put up certain suggestions aboutsabotage in aircraft factories to which Archer hadgiven a considered reply. I think both partiesfound the discussion useful.We had a Board Meeting today, at which the mainsubject for discussion was the new Advisory CommitteesIt was decided that the S.C.0.s at ports would assistthe local C.C. in putting up cases and that theCoinmand S.C.0. should sit as the military represen-tative, on the Cornmittee.

I gather however that thissuggestion is not feasible as the people in questionare only listening in on a specific wavelength andwould not hear broadcasts on the German wavelength.The problem is certainly a difficult one and we arenot helped by the fact that there is no satisfactorymachinery to enable us to enter somebody's housein search of wireless apparatus.March 28thDanish material: The Danes are worried about thesinking of their ships.

He would then makeanother substantial payment, for which he wouldobtain: receipt. The officer would demur about theinterior photograph, but in the end he would probablysuccamb. From this moment onwards the German agentwould dictate to the officer exactly what he was to dounder threat of giving him away, and for a time uldhave him kept under observation by other agentsmake sure that he did not give the whole showaway to his superiors. SLAMA said that the Germarisnearly always worked on this plan which made it mucheasier to combat their system, since once you couldestablish the type of agent with which you weredealing, you could arrest that man and force himto disclose his contacts.March 30thThe night was made hideous for several members of theCatalogueeReference:k4l186closure that copy No.. 1402of the deliberations of the War Council was reportedto have been lying for 36 hours under a cushionin the sitting-room of General Gamnelin's suite at theHyde Park Hotel.

It is interest-ing to note on this wholequestion of travel that inanswer to a question in the House the other dayOsbert Peake said that travel must of necessitybe restricted in war time and that the onus wa.s onthe alien to show that his journey was in thenational interest. It is difficult to see howtravel by communists can possibly be in the nationalinterest.Maxwell has replied to our memo of some months agoabout the status of Irishmen who wish to travel.We quoted the examples of SCHUTTE, O'TOOLE andothers and asked for some guiding line. We have gotthe usual answer which briefly implies that unlesswe have something specific against the individualnothing can be done. It seems that whenever we tryto deal with general principles weyare asked toquote specific examples, and when we quote specificexamples the general principles are ignored. Turneris replying to this memo and will see Maxwell.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/1864ouMrs. PLUGGE, wife of the M.P., , is going rather farwith the Egyptian Ambassador. He is now trying touse her in order to get information about her hus-band' activities.Maffey is concerned about the use of neutral diplo-matic bags from Eire to the Continent. He suspectsthe Dutch and the Italians.

Further enquiries are beingmade.The Sunday Despatch has an article by Lord Donegalon a conversation he has had from Belfast withPETERSEN in Dublin. Lord Donegal draws attentionto this very simple way of communicating with theenemy. The conversation was actually overheardby a telephonist and reported. The question oftelephone censorship from north to south is underconsideration.April lstI had a long discussion about journalists with Maude.We ought to have a section to deal with all the moreimportant ones. If there is any leakage of informatigoing on they will be the first people to hear aboutit, either through their own sources or throughforeign Embassies or Legations. Such informationmight be very important, particularly when movementsof troops are going on. It will be for Sinclair tokeep such a section informed as to the kind ofinformation they should look out for. There was aserious leakage in the Daily Herald the other dayabout wireless.

We discussed the posslityof sending over two girls with him on the boat butthe plan feil through as it was found he hadalready left.Sinclair tells me that the proposal to send anExpeditionary Force to Norway is once more on thetapis. There is also another scherne which the Frenchare to carry out for floating mines down the Rhine.There is nothing definite about Baku but we mayhear more when Simpson returns.Sinclair is running 3 double-cross agents at theInoment.

The Egyptian Minister is disappointed about the Moslem Union. He says the Russiansare interfering. Scandinavian material shows thatfrom the 4th month of the war between Russia andFinland negotiations were going on to obtain directcontact between the Finns and Russians throughSwedish channels. On the 29th February the Russiansagreed to negotiate with Ryti. Before that they hadinsisted on talking only through Kuusinen. ThePolish Ambassador in Paris takes the view that thedocuments recently published by the Germans whichpurport to show that the Americans were urging thePoles to fight are probably authentic.Dick has got, an interesting case. - A German Jew lawyenamed Alfred KAUFMANN has obtained the services ofMrs..

Indications are that KAUFMANN is what theCzechs would call a Typarsch.Catalobife RerefericeRv/A/Tee has rung up to say thattwo Tow Councillors in Birmingham are complainingthat an Italian called PICCIONI, who is ItalianConsular agent in Biriningham, is serving in theBirmingham A.R.P. Central Control and Report Centre.The Centre gets all reports on bomb damage and trans-mits them to the H.O. I said I would look him upbut thought that on fonn he would probably bepassing on anything of interest to the Italians, whowould pass it on to the Gerans. If he was a membof the Fascio he would certainly be acting in thisway. Later information is to the effect thathe is a member of the Fascio.D.S.S. spoke to me today about sabotage. I saidI thought there was no escape and that this departmentwould probably have to take on the work. It wasobviously something that had to be done and althoughwe might be ill-equipped there was no other-departmentcapable of co-ordinating the work. I fully realisedthat it would have to be done on a fairly comprehen-sive scale if it was to be any use at all. I didnot think it would be possible for us to confine our-selves to individuals who might be engaging in suchactivities. D.S.S. said he would speak to Lord HankeyA German agent named DURRENT gave himself up inEgypt some time ago and is being run by Maunsell.He mentioned that one of his contacts was a certainFURSEN of Aaberraa, Denmark. An early file on theSnow case mentions FURSEN. The place in Denmakrwhere he resdes is the same one from whichANDRESEN communicates with UNLAND. This is interest-ing and it may be that FURSEN and ANDRESEN are oneand the same person.SS.I.S. put up an interesting report on MOWADE' visitto Belgium.

We recommend internment of certain ofthe aliens now, internment of selected members ofthe C.P.G.B. in the event of war with Russia, closecontrol of other laien communists and restriction oftheir movements, restriction of the movements ofBritish communists wishing to proceed abroad orto Ireland and control of export of communistliterature.There was a board meeting today when the new Ad-visory Committees were again discussed. We are tosubmit Royal Prerogative cases which may come up asa result of our researches to the H.0., but we shallalso pass information to C.C.S .C.Aberysthwythhas already written in to say that as his 70 caseswere dealt with by the first Tribunal in 3 hourshe proposes to bring the whole of the enemy alienpopulation before the new Advisory Committee.Newsam now tells us that the Chairmen of the newTribunals were all spoken to at the H.O. on theirduties the other day.

I raised this question wash the Censorshipcomplained that they never got any neutral mail bags.As these bags do not, according to S.C.O.'s reports,come through the U.K. U.K.,We we can only assume that theygo by a direct route from Ireland to the continent.I am finding out what steps contraband control taketo ascertain whether there are mail bags on board.The Norwegian party is once more standing by.Birkett is said to be stiffening up and not releasingSO many internees.Hankey has spoken to D.S.S. about the policy ofinter nment of aliens. Hankey said that Sir JohnAnderson always had an answer. He wa.s saying that ifhe interned 20,000 the public would still be clamour-ing for more. This does not sound a very good argu-ment to me. If he would.only put in those we askedhim to put in and keep them there, it would besomething.The arguent is also put forwardthat since nothing leaked out about the damageto the "Nelson" in the German press, the enemy alienpopulation is not SO dangerous as the public thinks.The answer is that you do not necessarily publishall the information you obtain.April 5thA German station calling itself the New BritishBroadcasting station has been sending out statisticsof public feeling about the war in various districtsin this country. Maude is going to make someenquiries. It would I think be of interest to knowwhat organisations if any are collecting statisticsof this kind and whether they have covered theparticular districts mentioned. Needless to say theGerman reports indicate that in most places peopleCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186are opposed to or indifferent to the continuanceof the war.RIZZA is doomed. Lord Alness disliked him becausehe lied. He is to remain interned for the duration.We still have no power to enter a house to look forillicit wireless. Matters have been brought to ahead by some radio-therapy organisation calledHanovia which has been broadcasting a colossalbeam day and night. The discovery was made byol.Worledge and his boys with the vans.Maude discussed the matter with the H.0., but theredoes not seem to have been much progress.On the introduction of Wood I saw General OORSCHOTTE.I discussed with him the possibility of his givingus his assistance in the event of an influx of Dutchrefugees. He thinks that in such an eventualitywe should ask for him and one of his assistants, andhe believes that such a project would be favourablyreceived. He could also arrange for records. Hetold me that the whole of this had been planned inNovember. He had signed credentials from theMinister of War and was to have reported to hisMinister in London with staff and records as soon asthe first German crossed the frontier. The Dutchapparently have orders to remain in Holland during aGerman invasion. The only people to be evacuatedto certain other areas in Holland are those who arein the vicinity of the main line of defence from theZuyder Zee down south to the Belgian frontier.This is apparently a very strong line but Van Oor-schott may be a bit optimistic if he thinks willhold out indefinitely. His original idea in cominghere in November was to assist us in counter-espionage work and S.I.S. in running people intooccupied Holland. He is of opinion that the Germanshave been bluffing all along. Early in NovemberCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186THIS IS A COPYERIGINAL DOGUMENTRETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS412ACT 1958.2000Sass came hot room From Bertin with a story thathe had been approached by a German officer who hadbeen his intimate friend for many years. This officehad told him in strict confidence that Holland wouldbe invaded in the early hours of November 12th.Sass was very excited and said he wished to see theQueen of Holland. Van Oorschott regarded this asmerely a move by the Germans in the Nervenkries sincehe had had similar reports from his frontier policewho had been in touch vith the Germans. An oldGeneral was called in to give an independent opinion.He said that if a German officer gave: away importantinformation, it could be taken as a certainty thathe was acting under instruction. Van Oorschott saidthat the reports about the purchase of Belgian uni-forms by German agents was also part of the generalbluff. It was ridiculous to suppose that theseuniforms could not equally well have been purchasedor made in Gerany. Van Oorschott did not disclosein any way that he suspected the bona fides of Sasswho of course was reported to us by before thewar as a German agent who was in constant touch withthe German Legation at the Hague.Van Oorschott is still used in a consultativecapacity by the Dutch General Staff. His-successorGeneral Fabius seems to be more or less a figure-head.Feeling in Holland and Belgium is very stronglyantiGerman. Van Oorschott is of opinion that if anattack is launched through Maastrecht, the Dutch wilfight and fall back on the Belgian positions, whichare very strong. If Belgium is attacked without anyviolation of Dutch neutrality, it is estimated that65% of the Dutch population would be in favour ofgiving assistance to the Belgians. There does notappear however to be any pre-arranged plan. Equallythere does not seem to be any definite arrangementto cover the eventuality of Holland being attackedCataloguteeference:rvf4rfafi Belgian neutrality.u13April 6thA Lt. C.COBHAM has called at Room 055 saying that hewas approached in a pub called the Boltons in EarlsCourt Road by an unknown individual who shovred himphotographs of the 3.7 .A. gun and asked him forphotographs of other calibres for which he wasapparently prepared to pay.

He is to send a message to say that thesteamship company refused to give the information andto ask whether he can enlist the co-operation ofSTEWART. This may produce some useful reactions.Snow has picked up a crook called CELEk' T.A.R.has a long statement from CELER-I who iswanted bythe police.

Germany, working through Italyand Russia, is apparently trying to detach theTurks from the Allies. Hafiz Wabba, the Saudi-Arabian minister, has returned from his visit toKabul, Teheran, Rome and Cairo. He thinks theItalians will be a real friend of Islam and wasevidently rather impressed by what he saw in Rome.S.I.S. material of 4.4.40: The following accounthas been given of the Brenner meeting between Hitlerand Musso.

He wa.s told that this dependedon how far Russia was going to assist Germany todefeat the blockade. The Russians seem a littleanxious about their position. A report on theinternal situation in Germany shows that the situationis not quite SO good and could become serious ifGermany suffered any sort of real setback. Germanconfidence is an artificial growth from Goebbels'hot-house.Rothschild came to see me on his return from Paris.He had quite a clear picture of the general organisa-tion in France for dealing with sabotage. As ineverything else, the military are responsible. Theactual department is what is known as the 5eme Bureauwhich works directly under the General Staff, and isassisted by the Surete. There are 20 regionalorganisations which conduct minute investigationsinto the situation at all vulnerable points, and makerecommendations which have to be carried out.The Germans invaded Denmark and Norway on Tuesday9th April. We had previously announced the sowing ofmines along the Norwegian coast and within the 3-milelimit. From subsequent information it seems howeverthat the Germans had already succeeded in establishingthemselves at certain points along the coast. Ibelieve there was some plan by which we hoped tointercept the Germans but that it fell through owingto bad weather. It looks as if the "Glow-worm" whichremained behind to look for a sailor who had beenwashed over board, actually intercepted the Germanson their way to Narvik.April l6thCecil has gone to Belfast for a consultation withWickham and Gilfillan.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186L47BODE has been re-interned and his case is to comebefore the Advisory Committee.It has been suggested that we should try andestablish contact both with the Danes and Norwegianshere. Curry is going to explore this matter withU. 35.A Mr. Orange who is the Chief I.O. in Jersey, wasbrou ht over to see me by Drinlwater. It came outin conversation that he has been in the habitof issuing exit permits to aliens proceeding directfrom Jersey to France. I pointed out to him that itwould be quite possible for an alien to be refused apermit to leave this country and then to proceed toJersey and thence to France. He admitted that thiswas a loophole and agreed in future to refer all suchpermits to us via the Aliens Branch. He is alsogoing to see that no enemy aliens are allowed to leavethe island whether they are in Cat.] or Cat.( C. Thereis however nothing to prevent Cat.C aliens here fromgoing to Jersey although I do not think they can domuch harm. There is a station there of the FleetAir Arm which is used for training purposes. It hasbeen established about 6 weeks. N.I.D. say that.they do not attach any importance to this unit froma security angle. Mr. Orange is going to let us havea list of aliens in the island, which we will havepassed over our records.BelgianIt has been decided to set up a Dutch/Section underBaxter and a Swiss Section under Kenneth. This is totake effect from tomorrow. These sections are todeal with individuals of every nationality visitingthese countries and to be kept informed by othersections of all aspects affecting those countries.The Chief of Staff's sub-committee passed a resolutiona short time ago when discussing the qiestion ofvulnerable points, to the effect that they wereCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1864isconcerned about the danger to these points fromenemy aliens. Newsam prepared a memo for thediscussion of this resolution in the Home DefenceCommittee and submitted it to us for our approval.The offerding para. stated that even if all enemyaliens were interned it would not be possible torelax the vigilance at vulnerable points since actsof sabotage might equally well be committed byBritish subjects or neutrals and particularly bymembers of the I.R. Newsam then went on to offera long apologia for the H.0. policy regarding enemyaliens since the beginning of the war and to state thatthere was no mean course between wholesale internmentand the present policy. We replied saying that whilewe agreed with the offending para. we could not agreewith the remainder and that we were therefore sub-mitting a separate note with our recommendations.These included wholesale internment of Cat.B, thedeclaring of additional protected places and theimmediate evacutation from such places of all enemyaliens. This seems to be the only possible proposalwhich in the light of their policy since the outbreakof war the H.0. could logically put forward. Myfeeling was that the tribunals had in fact givencertain meaningless categories but as these werethe only figures we had to work on the reconmer dationS ould be made on the understanding that there wouldbe quite a number of people in Cat.C who shouldbe interned would remain at large, at any rate untilthey had been combed out by the new Advisory CommitteesI felt that it would be difficult to argue that theinternment of these 8,000 would give us anything morethan about 301 security but that in the circumstancesthe internment of any enemy alien was better thannothing.April 17thI discussed sabotage once more with D.S.S. I pointedout that at the moment we were without staff, SirFrancis Griffith being ill, Capt. Godf'ry gone toNorway, and without any plan of action. He saidCatalogue Reference:KV/47186that he would take the matter up with Lord Hankeyand try and obtain a charter.There was a meeting of the Bacteriological Committeein the afternoon which wa.s attended by Harker. LordHankey was in the chair and about 30 other peoplewere present. Lord Hankey evidently seemed to thinkthat M.I.5 ought to be doing something more than theywere, but no issue was raised as regards ourresponsibilities and no decision of any consequenceseems to have been reached.There have been various rumours today that Italyis camning into the war. It was said that the Vice-Consul in Glasgow packed up but this subsequentlyproved to be untrue.According to the Eire censor there is only one outletfor Irish mails from Eire, namely via Kingstown.The Censorship in Eire aims at being 100jo of mailsin and out of the country. If the pressure istoo great some of the in mails are dropped. Thereis 100, censorship of trans-atlantic terminal mails.April 18thThere was a director's meeting at which D.S.S. explainethat he had taken our memo making recommendationswith regard to the internment of aliens Cat.B etc.to the H.O. and had discussed it with Newsam and Menwel]At the conclusio of the discussion DSS hadwithdraw the memo as he felt that the H.O. weretaking the only possible line. I asked whether thisimplied that we had acquiesced in the ters ofNewsam's meo to the Home Defence Cormittee. D.S.S.replied that it did, but said that he had made onealteration in a statement which gave the impressionthat we had only to submit cases to H.O in orderto get a man interned. I pointed but that Newsam'smemo was grossly misleading in a number of otherpoints e.g. in the matter of travel he had spokenabout visa policy and said nothing about exit permitsCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186or the lack of control exercised over the grantingof them The question was raised by others presentas to our position vis a vis the fighting services,but the matter was left in abeyance. Turner saidthat after our memo had veen received by the H.O. hewas then rung up by Newsam who asked what was the meeniof this volteface on the part of M.I.5. Turnervery properly said that there was no volteface and thathese had always been our views but that we had beenobliged to conform to H.O. policy. Tt wa.s agreed thaTurner would go through the memo again with D.S.S. ansee if there was anything further to be done.Jasper and I saw Rothschild this morning. He explainwhat the general attitude was towards. M.I.5. inthe Bacteriological Courmittee. He also said thatvarious French officers would be coming over hereshortly-a would-b be pleased- to discuss matters oforganisation with us. Rothschild will have. as muchas 5 days a week free if we like to avail ourselvesof his services. We told him that as soon as we-coulget a charter we should welcome his assistance.Archer has discovered that insurance is in certaincircumstances a serious source of leakage; sinceproduction figures have re-to-be-disclosed toAn S.I.S. report dated 3.4.40 indicates that Musso ipursuing a more forward policy and seems tobeprepared to stand up to the King.

The other documentswere sealed up. Owing to certain markings on thismap CIGOGNA was told that he could notgo when hearrived at the port. This has caused a trernendousstor in the F.0. as they say that he is a friend ofCiano's and himself very pro-British. Nicholls ofthe Italian Section wanted me to talk to Sir RonaldGraham. I said that I was very sorry but that ourControl Officers had certain definite instructions,that the map has been taken, that it had certainmarkings, and that until these had been properlyexamined by the Service Departments there wasnothing to be done.

I said I wondered how far he wasreally cognisant of ou difficulties, since hisinterrogation seemed to have been of a rather super-ficial kind. He might be quite satisfied with us, butvere we satisfied with ourselves? Personally I feltthat, largely owing to the circumstances in which wehave been placed by Govt.policy, we were singullarlyill-informed in a variety of directions. Of the74,000 aliens at large in this country we really knewpractically nothing. We might therefore quite easilybe sitting on a volcano.

No Russian advanin Scandinavia is expected. In such an everstualityit is thought that the Finas would resist. On 9.4.the German Ambassador in Belgium approached Spaakthe Foreign Minister. He. said that England waspreparing to attack Belgiumn and wanted to know theattitude of elgium if as a counter-measure Germanyoccupied the Frisian Islands. Spaak's answer is noknow. Considerable military activity is going onin Slovakia, particularly in Bratislava. Thesepreparations were to be completed by April 15th.0:April 3rd Musso vas reported to be rather out ofCatalogue ReferenGeBketh/eleting but not yet committeu2sto any definite line.A report dated April l6thbelieved to be reliable states that at a meetingbetween the King of the Belgians and his personaladvisers it was decided not to go to the assistanceof Holland should she alone be attacked. Mussoseems to require some guarantee from the alliesthat no attempt will be made to upset his regimeif they are victorious. He also wants certainconcessions. Suner the Spanish Minister for HameAffairs learned this from Gambarra. It seems thatalthough Suner has no brief for the allies he wOUlike to see Musso disintangle himself from Germany.Spain and Italy could then proceed with a pro-Allypolicy which would be more profitable to them both.On April 17th the Swedes were still reported to bestanding firm against German requests for passage oftroops.. The e-Swedes would only-modify their attitudeif Norway capitulated or if Germany were successfulin occupying the whole of Norway.

Hewas extremely worried about the policy vis a vis ali-ens being pursued by the H.O. He showed me theresults of the work of his local Advisory Committee.Out of 20 Cat.B cases, 17 had been put down to Cat.0and the remaining 3 had been kept in Cat.B. Nonehad been interned. I asked Legge whether he hadattended the meeting of C.C.S at the 0. to discussthe policy of the new Advisory Committees. He saidCatalogtehReference:kv4/1se and that only 4- BoroughC.C.S S and 4 County C.C.S had been present.rlApril 22ndI saw Johnston today, who is a candidate for employ-ment here and a friend of Kenneth Younger. He seemedquite suitable and we are making arrangements toget him.The Director of Intelligence,Air Ministry, is compil-ing a note on the alien situation for submissionto the J.1.C. Jo has been asked to discuss the noteprivately with Archie Boyle. I gather that the J.I.0meeting wants to be informed about possible 5thcolumn activities here in the event of a Geranattack.The F.O. are still fussing about Count Cigogna.Apparently they have had a complaint from the ItalianEmbassy that CIGOGNA wa.s told by the Travel Censor-ship Bureau that he could take his map, and thenhad it taken away from him and also that he was sub-jected to further interference when he left.I explained to them that these allegations were untruexcept that before leaving certain other papers weretaken from him which had not passed the censor, andthat this was a purely routine matter. F.0. seemto think that a red carpet should be laid down forthese people. I explained to them that the PortControl Officers had certain duties which they hadto perform, and that in the circumstances they hadacted quite correctly although it wa.s possible thatthe markings on the map would prove to be of nospecial interest. We are still without any decisionregarding the export of subversive literature.There wa.s an inter-departmental Committee held underthe chaimanship of Maxwell which discussed thisquestion at least 4- months ago. Farquhar of theF.O. raised the matter again and Halifax has writtento Sir Hohn Reith. The difficulty is that neitherthe Ministry of Information nor the F.O. nor theH.O. wish to take the responsibility for placing anyparticular publication on the Black List.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186421D.S.S. tells me that in the matter of sabotage Hankeyhas given instructions that we are to proceed in ournormal advisory way and that if any Minister failsto act on our advice we are to report the matter tohim.The Lascar who is being awaited by Snow has turnedup bringing with him the two wireless valves.

We are getting him disembodied.I spoke to D.S.S. and D.D.S. about the new tribunalswhich seem to be going wrong. D.D.S. went to seeMaxwell and Newsam, and eventually persuaded themto stop the hearing of Cat B cases in non-protectedCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1862 sareas until the questionnaire had been filled in ancsubmitted to this office for our observations.April 24thI gave a lecture to Security Command Officers whoare to be members of the new tribunals. Theseofficers have no vote but can ask any question theylike and offer any opinion. If i-they think that thecase has been mishandled they can report the fact tothe Vi.O. who will pass their observations on to theH.O. The same applied to the Admiralty-representa-tives. I gave a brief outline of the circust tancesW hich had led to the setting up of the newtribunalsI explained our difficulties both before and since tiwar and strongly emphasised the view that the tribunals had gone wrong -date ecause-internment wa.sregarded as a punishment rather than a preventivemeasure and because any quasi-iegal body was alwayslooking for-evidence. I explained verycarefullythe organisation of the Nazi Party and pointed outall the various fallacies and pitfalls in dealing witso-called refugees from Nazi oppression. Finally Itook the questionnaire and explained in detail thereasons the questions-asked- further pointsof significance that might be elucidated. Personall,I begin to doubt whether any tribunal will everachieve the results which we want.E had lunch with Stewart: He told told-me-that- ne-that things inNorway were not going too well. The main difficultywas that we had no real base, Nemsos had beenseriously damaged and we were forced to land trooosat little fishing jetties under considerable diffi-culties. I gather that we had about 3 brigades: inNaay and that the troops based alt Nemsos were beingvery hard pressed. An added difficulty is thatwe have no air bases and that our fighters cannotoperate satisfactorily since they have not got aCatalaguecreeferenge:Ky4to86 me that the French wereTHIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOEUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958by way of having gone Hate the Kebbegat but that ourair patrols had reported that they were nowhere nearit.

Hedestroyed all his documents and one of his wirelesssets. He took the other with him and joined thNorwegian H.Q. when C. opened up communicationththis country. Our .A. who has since turned upreports that had it not been for Foley it isquite likely that the Norwegians would have givenin. Foley was able to encourage them by promises ofsupport from this country. Another wireless set hassince been flow out to Foley, and 3 others areoperating with the various British contingents.These haveralll been supplied by SI.S. since-otherapparetus of the kind seems singularly out of date.The sets I gather are designed byandS:I.D. have them operating from Geran territoryand from all over the continent. Stewart believesthat they are extremely difficult to pick up anddoubts very much whether any monitoring systemhowever widespread will be effective against them.If Snow's set a sample of the best he--Germanscan do, it would seem that we are fairly well aheadin this matter. It would not however be safe toassume this, particularly in view of a statement Jy.two German prisoners of war which was overheardat Cockfosters to the effect that they got veryuseful information from Scapa about the movements ofships.Hordern C.Lancs came to see me today. He wasworried about Cat.o enemy aliens. He pointed outthat se-people could establish themselves in anyarea without prior permission and that all the C.C.got was their registration card. He might thereforehave got Cat. aliens in his area concerning whomCatalogue there Reference would be information with some other C.C. and1orwith himself.u 3oHe was also worried about Cat.C enemy aliensgenerally. He knew nothing about them. Their nameshad never been passed over our records and he there-fore had ifficulty in selecting those who should bebrought before the Advisory Cormittees. He suggestedthat we should vet all Cat.c aliens in his area.I agreed but said that on that analogy we should alsovet the whole of Cat.C, totalling some 64,000.This is going to be a tremendous task and willfurther clog our machinery. Practically speakingwe know nothing about any of these people. If theyare to be allowed to remain at large there are only2 ways of obtaining inforation about them: (a) toget them to fill in the special forms on which theyare asked a number of pertinent questions and (b)to get local C.C.S to set up some organisation whichwill penetrate enemy alien circl S in their area..Bucks has already written to us on this subject.He says however that he has not got the necessaryfunds or organisation to do it and wants our adviceand assistance. C.C.Berks says that with the llmitedfunds at his disposal he has set up a kind of Gestapobut he does not feel that it is really adequate.We are asking the H.0. to send a circular letter toC.C.s requesting them to ass on all relevant infor-mation to a fellow C.C. when a Cat.C enemny alienleaves their area for some other district. Thewider problem of dealing with Cat. will needfurther thought.April 25thRothschild came to see us today and wa.s introducedto D.S.S. He is coming in next week for a week orten days to try and get the hang of our files. Hewill then work out a plan of campaign and also giveus the benefit of his advice and assistance for 3days a week.Craigie, our Ambassador in Tokyo, has made asuggestion that we should exchange military andCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1864 31political information with the Japs about Russia. Wehave said that there would be no practical advantagefrom our point of view in such an exchange, whichwould be bound to be rather one-sided, and that thepolitical repercussions might be considerablesince it was quite certain that the Russians arebreaking Jap cyphers. The evidence of this wasobtained some time ago when it became known thatMaisky was communicating to the News Chronicleinformation relating to discussions going onbetween Berlin,Toky and Rome about an extensionof the anti-Comintern Pact on military lines.It must be taken therefore as almost a certaintythat anything we might tell the Japs would reachnot only the Russians but probably also the Germansand Italians.Cecil has seen CARRIGAN again. The latter has madeconsiderable progress but seems to have talked aboutthe scheme to quite a number of people includingPhilip Gibbs and Hambro. CARRIGAN has suggestedthat Maurois would be a good person to start theball rolling in France. Cecil agrees, but feels thatMaurois, woing to his strong pro-British bias, shouldremain well in the background.I had a discussion with Adam on the question ofDanish seamen. It seems to me that we must regardthese people with considerable suspicion. Itwould moreover be quite possible for the Germansonato make use of the pro-Nazi Danes from South Jufandfor some kind of Quisling manoeuvre over here.They could also supply Germans with Danish seamen'papers. At the moment our seamen carry no properidentification papers and if a foreigner could obtaina seamens discharge document he could quite easilysign on a British ship and become to all intents andpurposes a British subject. The control at portsis obviously hopelessly inadequate. The ImmigrationDepartment are very much under-staffed and do noteven pretend to examine the crews and passengersCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1832a number of boats reaching our shores. A particu-larly glaring example is that of the se-calledEire coastal boats. Being regarded as Britishthey are never subject to examination. One of theseboats could go over with a crew of 10 and come backwith a crew of 8 and nobody would be any the wiser.Air Ministry Intelligence Reports state that thesale of papers in Italy has gone down considerably.Propaganda has evidently gone far beyond saturationpoint and in order to get at the truth people arebuying Vatican papers, the sale of which has increasedby 900%.April 26thLeggett has sent me a copy of a letter which he haswritten about communist activities to Maxwell,expressing the views of the Ministry of Labour.Hesays that the activities of communist agents in theworkshops is more serious now than for a long timeand he thinks with the new plans in operation theywill become more troublesame. Trade Union activitieswould welcome action which would restrict thoseamong their members and officials who are taking aleading part in present operations. This appliesspecially to the A.E.U. Leggett is satisfiedfrom recent experience that we may have seriousindustrial trouble of a kind which presents thegreatest difficulty unless there is a stand againstsubversive Inovements. He also draws attention toCzech communists in the British Youth Peace Movement.He thinks it wrong that these people should be atlarge.The Home Secretary has submitted to the Home PolicyCommittee on April 22nd certain amnendments in thelaw. He suggests that a regulation should beprepared to cover the internment of any aliens whounder normal conditions would be deported. He alsorecommends that there should be some recommendationCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1864 33to restrict the movements etc. of British subjectson similar lines to Cat.E aliens. As regards anti-war propaganda he says that the case against theP.P.U is under consideration but that he does notthink the existing laws are adequate. He is doubtfulhowever whether any amendment can be made withoutcontravening the traditional principles of allowingfree speech and free associations in politicalbodies even if these bodies are prejudicial to whatthe great majority of our people regard as theessential interests of the country".We have received from the W.O. copies of theminutes of the meeting of the Home Policy Committeeon the subject of communism and fascism. We havealso had a copy of Mrs. Vyvian Adams' memo which shepresented to the Committee on these subjects. Itis a somewhat superficial document. It still seemsto me that our work on these matters is not beingmade use of by the Cabinet. If any department isqualified to put up amemo on the subject ofsubversive movements here surely it is the SecurityService. I mentioned this to B. who has spoken toNorman Brook. Brook says that Sir John Andersonhas decided that all information about cormunsmand fascism is to be put up through the H.O. Ihave suggested to Harry that he might perhaps liketo discuss with D.M.I. the possibility of theChief of Staff being represented on the HomePolicy Committee. It seems to me that theyhave a perfect right to be SO represented seeing thatthis country is really Far more a military base thanthe areas occupied by the B.E.F. in France. TheChief of Staff therefore should have some say inthe policy being adopted with regard to subversivemovements.I saw a young eolicitor called Lee today. He is apossible candidate for B.8 or B.lO. He appears tohave a fair knowledge of German and a good knowledgeof French and to be generally intelligent. It hasCatatogue Reference.KVi4/186 he wil] join us.434We had a Board Meeting today when the French TravelAgreement was discussed. I read a paper preparedby B.S which makes it quite clear that in presentcircustances it is quite impossible for us to carryout the ters of the French agreement. We haveundertaken in Clauses1 and 2 that travel facilitiesare provided on condition that the respective Frenchand British authorities are satisfied that theproposed journey is not undesirable for reasons ofnational security or public interest. Clause 6provides that the competent British and Frenchauthorities shall communicate with each other thenames of persons whose applications for entry orexit visas from Franch or t.Britain shall havebeen refused for reasons of national security. Itfollows therefore that if effect is to be given tothis agreement, the competent British authorities musthave an opportunity of deciding in the case of eachapplicant whether there are any security groundsfor refusing his application. As things are atpresent applications for British subjects are noteven submitted to this office. It seems essentialthat some attempt should be made to clarify thesituation. I am taking this matter up with D.D.S.The Board Meeting also discussed a letter from LordHankey forwarding a copy of a Le tter from Eden andalso one from Sir John Maffey. The Irish haveapparently complained to Maffey about ar articlewhich appeared in the Mi rror stating that spiesin Eire are having a free hand etc. Walshe, theForeig n Minister, had said that in view of the closewatch kept on the German Legation there could be noquestion of the Germans having any secret serviceorganisation. He had gone on to say that if theBritish Government cared to post intelligence agentsof their own to watch the German Legation no difficultwould be raised. Walshe had also spoken on thequestion of illicit wireless and ey ressed the viewthat he doubted whether anything of the kind wasgoing on, though he did not deny the possibility.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186435Eden suggests that we might takce advantage ofWalshe's offer and Hankey wants our comments.Personally I think it is quite out of the questionto consider posting agents outside the GermanLegation in Dublin. This would be insulting toArcher and would inevitably lead to trouble. Asregards wireless, we have definite evidence thata station has been broadcasting within 25 milesof Dublin in official Geran diplomatic code toNauen. This station has been active on twooccasions but the Eire Govt. have failed tolocate it. There may well be other stations vorkingsince they cannot even hear their own I.R.A. stationsAs far as we know they have no monitoring system.I intend to consult V.V. about the reply to Hankeyand also to have a talk with Archer when he comesover to Droitwich.V.V. in his Irish report mentions a man calledRICKETT who is the interediary between the I.R.A.and Gerany. This man has been attending secretI.R.A. meetings and seems to be in communicationwith German submarines off the west coast of Eire.The Indian on the "City of Simla" has beenidentified by ROLf who got on board the boat asa member of the rumaging crew. This is a usefulpiece of work. The whole incident illustratesthe ease with which communication can be establishedbetween Germans and their agents in this country.April 27thIt has been established that the individual whosent the Lascar withthe two valves for Snow isalmost certainly Obed HUSSEIN, disaffected Indian,who has been residing in Antwerp for some time and iswell known to I.P.I.S-I.S. reports 21/4: Sources in touch with theGerman Embassy in Rome say that the King of Italy isstrongly opposing war. On April 17th the policy ofCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186436refraining from giving support to Holland if shealone were attacked was abandoned by the NelgianCabinet and the King.April 28thCami for half a day, then went down to Wareham.April 29th - May 6thAway on leave.May 7thReturned. A good deal seems to have been going onwhile T was away. The most important matter is thepaper submitted to us by the J.I.C. on the intern-ment of enemy aliens. It appears that the Committeewere supplied with a paper paperswritten swritten by NewsamNewsam was asked to attend one of the sessions andwas severely cross-examined. The Committee wereevidently not impressed by the policy which had beenpursued by the H.O. up to date and were stronglyof opinion that something more should be done. Theirviews have been submitted to us for our comments andwe have in reply put up a criticism of the H.O.memoand recommendations (1) for the internment of allCat.B enemy aliens between the ages of 18 and 65,(2) for the internment of all male non-refugee Cat.enemy ali eas between the ages of 18 and 65 (3) forthe declaration of a number of other ports asprotected places and (4) the removal from such placesof all enemy aliens except the aged, sick and infir.A cable has just been received from Canada to saythat they have documentary evidence that one of theItalian Consuls in Canada has issued instructionsto Italians to commit acts of sabotage in the eventof Italy coming into the war, and that explosivesfor this purpose have been assembled. We arecirculating this to the Dominions and ColoniesCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186437and also to the Fighting Services and the H.O.Owing to the strained relations with Italy preparationhas been made foe the arrest of members of theFascio here. H.O. however do not wish to internanybody who is over the age of 60. This seems ratherabsurd as there are large number's of individuals over60 who are on the Directorate of the various Fasci.We are submitting these cases with details to theH.O. O. We are also asking them to intern some 300dual nationals who are meinbers of the Fascio. Wesubmitted these cases to them last July but havenever had their views.The work in B19 is on the increase and it looks asif we want more people to listen in to telephoneconversations.Two Goanese have turned up at Snow's office. Theywant to know whether the valves have been received.Efforts are being made to identify them with a viewto having them followed whenever they arrive here.Stopford has suggested that we should try and form8 description index on the automatic system ofpunching cards. I agree that something of the kindmight be useful. The great difficulty is thata description is SO often inaccurate. It is quitepossible to have 3 or descriptions of the sameman by different eople which bear very littleresemblance to each other. Something I thinkmight be done if the formation of such an index wasin the hands of a responsible person who woulld seethat the description really was an accurate one madeby someone who set out with the intention of gettingit. Casual descriptions by people who are justrelying on their memories are of little value andoften misleading.Stopford also feels very strongly in the case of aBlitzkrieg it would be 8 desirable thing if ourCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186438records were duplicated in the same way as has beendone by business firms. It is possible to do thisby photography without developing the films unlessthey are actually required. I should say that thisis a tremendous problem which ought to be seriouslyconsidered.We have during the past week had two cases of Eirecitizens who have been approached abroad by Geranagents. They have been supplied with secret inksfor communication purposes.An underground account of the C.P.G.B. has beendiscovered at the National Provincial Bank. It is theexecutory account of one STALKER of the InternationalBrigade who wa.s killed in Spain. The account ismanipulated by Miss HOWARD, who lives with Bill RUST.She has paid fairly large suns to Eva RECKETT, SHANDand others. The account seems to be fed by MissHOWARD. Further enquiries are being made.May 8thWe had a board meeting today. The problem ofBelgian and Dutch refugees was considered. Iexplained that we had made tentative arrangementsboth with the Dutch and Belgians, for a small staffand records to come over here. These arrangementscould not be of a very concrete kind, owing to thedelicate position in which the Belgians and Dutchfound themselves. I said that I thought it wasessential that these refugees should be held in somecamp or other until we had had the opportunityof going into their cases with native experts.It is certainly desirable that any who were toobtain employment in the arnament industry shouldbe carefully vetted. Nobody seems to know exactlywhat the arrangements are. D.D.S, undertook tofind out.The Travel Committee conclusions were mentioned byCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186139D.D.S. and Adam is to draft working instructionsbased on its conclusions.Allen mentioned that the J.I.C. Committeewould probably be asking for our views, particularlyas to what we thought should be done with Britishsubjects who were members of the 5th colun. I saidthat I thought alien comunists should be internedforthwith, that British comnunists could be leftuntil a declaration of war with Russia, but thatcertain members of the B.U.F. should be dealt witnow.Turner who had been attending a meeting on thesubject of legislation for dealing wi.th communistsor Fascists, gave us a very depressing account ofthe lack of progress made. The impression given isthat the present legislation is inadequate and thatnobody thinks it worth while to take any steps toimprove.llI raised the question of the 641000 Cat.0 enemyaliens and the complaints raised by various C.C.Sthat they were entirely wi thout any infomationregarding these people and without funds to pursueenquiries. There seem to be two ways of obtaininginformation: (1) by getting the provinces toincrease their S.B.officers, and (2) by insistingthat all Cat.C enemy aliens should fill in aquestionnaire. The latter would mean the open-ing of some 64,000 files and an inmense amount ofclerical work. It was decided that I should drafta letter for the H.O. suggesting that the necessaryfunds should be made available for the C.C.S toimprove that section of their organisation which dealswith M.I.5 matters. The matter of the questionnairewas left in abeyance.Our memo to the J.I.C. Committee is to be sent forwardwith an additional para recommending that a memberof the Italian Fascio should not be allowed toCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1864y0reside in protected areas.Maxwell has replied to our memo about the suggestedinternment of alien conunists and in certaineventualities British communists. His letter is veryunsatisfactory from our point of view. He isobviously fighting a sort of rear guard action. Heis at pains to point out that this and that cannotbe done for one reason or another.Dick is replying to each specific point and I havesuggested that he should add a para at the end tothe effect that the whole question should be treatedon broader lines. We should agree that in thepresent circumstances it is desirable for certainpeople to be interned or restricted and then if theexisting regulations are inadequate frame others whichwill cover the points we require.I accompanied D.S.S. to the High Comissioner forEire's Office today for a discussion with Walsh.the Eire Minister for External Affairs.Walsh wanted to know whether we were satisfied withwhat his Govt. was doing and whether we had anysuggestions to make which might assist in stoppingup any loopholes. I mentioned the question of shipscrews and passengers and explained that in the caseof neutral ships we now had the N.E.P. scheme in forcealthough it was not operating 100jo owing to lackof guards. These regulations however were not appliedto Eire ships. He appreciated the point and saidhe thought he could help us by enforcing somethingin the nature of N.E.P. in Eire. This would at leastprevent aliens from leaving their ships and gettingjobs on cross-channel boats sailing under the Eireflag. We then discussed the question of wireless.Itold him that we were trying to set up a monitoringsystem here on a 5-inile radius basis as this was theonly method by which we could detect illicit wirelesssets with any degree of accuracy. There is no suchCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186y4hrorganisation in Eire and Walsh would be glad if wewould discuss the whole question thoroughly withArcher. I said that I was not very clear whetherthe Eire Govt. had received the necessary wirelessequipment fror this country. I thought it possiblethat this was not so as we ourselves had had greatdiffioilty in obtaining wireless sets and vans. Walshdid not know quite what the position was. I mentionedthe station which had been sending out German diplo-matic code to Nauen. He wa.s interested to hear thatthis station had come uo twice. He had thought arat first that it might have been a submarine buthe thinks that as it came up a second time on thesame bearings ht must definitely be an illicitstation. He then mentioned the recent outrage inDublin, where an attempt had been made by the I.R.A.to capture Maffey's bag and the bag for the HighCommissioner. De V. was definitely very worriedabout the incident and had suggested that in futureall communications should be in cypher. Walshsaid this of course was..quite impossible but theywould have to consider very seriously hether thebag should not be accompanied at all stages by an armeguard. Alternatively he thought that they mightperhaps use teleprinting if this was not tooexpensive. I said that I would make enquiries aboutteleprinting and let him know.Walsh wa.s extremely friendly and wa.s very anxiousthat I should go over to Dublin as soon as itwas convenient. He expressed his willingnessto do anything he possibly could to help us instepping up any loop-holes.I discussed with Curry the question of ItalianConsulates. Definite information has been receivedthat the Italian Consul in Liverpool has beencollecting data about our aerodromes. The policehave got hold of a copy of a map wi.ch he left in hiscar, showing aerodromes in the vicinity marked on it.He is being kept under close observation. It seemsCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186Huhighly desirable that similar action should be takenby C.C.S where Italian Consulates are established.A letter is being sent to them in this sense. Weshould I think also consider the question oftelephone checks. There is no doubt that we aresingularly ill-equipped for dealing with matters ofthis sort. We should really have had all theseconsulates under close observation since thebeginning of the war. The principle difficultyhas been the operation of telephone checks and theinadequacy of provincial police organisationsfor enquiries of the kind. Added to this we haveall along been urged by the F.O. to do nothingwhich would irritate the Italians. We cannot affordto go on like this any longer in view Of the docu-mentary evidence that the Canadians have obtainedwhich shows that one of the Consulates in Canddahas definite instructions for sabotage activitiesin the event of Italy coming into the war.D.S.S. has seen Maxwell who has agreed to send outa letter to C.C.S on the basis of the informationreceived from Canada.H.O. have written to Mr.Scholl of the PostalCensorship regarding material obtained which relatesto I.R.A. activities. The instruetions are that(1) in cases where suspicious activity is disclosedand it is not clear whether the activity refers toI.R.A., the original letter and in the case oftelephone conversations a copy of the report on theconversation, should be sent to M.1.5. If thematter is of interest to the police M-I.5. will senda copy to S.B. (2) A11 letters of purely I.R.A.interest are to go in original to H.O who afterconsulting S.B. will retain or send on the letter inquestion. (3) Telephone conversations of a purelyI.R.A. interest are to be sent direct to Sir NormanKendal. Where they relate to serving members of theared forces a copy should also be sent to M.I.5.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/18643On 30th April a draft order in council wa.s approvedby His Majesty extending the scope of D.R.11 soas to include the export in bulk of newspapers ofundesirable character to be prohibited. The Ministerof Information has been asked to prohibit theexport under this order of the Daily Worker and of"Action" and to consider as a metter of urgencysimilar action in the case of other publications.On 2nd May the War Cabinet Leakage of InformationCommittee met under the chairmanship of LordHankey to discuss leakage of information fromEire. It was decided to have a test censorship10-20; of mails for one week.H.O. have ruled that 18b cases can only conunicatewith personal friends or relations or their connsel.They may not communicate with M.P.S as has been thecase in one or two instances.The War Cabinet J.I.C. reported on the 2nd Maythat an attack by air on limited bjectives suchas aerodromes, over stations etc. could not beruled out. They considered that provided morestringent precautions were taken by the civil andmilitary authorities in this country againstsabotage and by local defence against landingsby parachute and air-borne troops,and invasion bysea or air would be a hazardous undertaking SO longas our air force remained intact and wecontrolled the north sea even with light forces.May 9thAccording to the press and S. .S. the Dutch havearrested a nuuber of important German agents. Theseinclude de RANTZOW and a Coumander, probably the twoindividuals who have been in direct contact withSnow. Arrangements have been made with the DutchCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/186444by which we shall see any papers obtained. It willbe interesting to see what arrangements are now madefor communicating with Snow.Allchin of the Consular Dept. of the F.O. tells methat the repatriation of Geran women from thiscountry has been temporarily suspended as the Germansare threatening to arrest British subjects in Denmark.I had asked Allchin what our policy was at themoment regarding the repatriation of Gemnans. Eexplained that we had vetted several parties but thatit seemed to me that we ought to be getting somethingin exchange. Allchin entirely agreed, but seemedignorant about the general policy. He himself wasconcerned only with Consulate staffs but he thoughtthat the women might well be used as bargainingcounters.. I had previously spoken to Sir GeorgeWarner at the F.O. about this matter. He was ratherstuffy and took the view that it was no business ofours but a matter of high policy. Allchin who hadalso spoken to him got a similar reply, but he isgoing to make it his business to enquire into thematter more closely.Curry has raised the question of searching the head-quarters of the Fascio and possibly Consulates in theevent of war with Italy. We are getting out a listof Fascio headquarters which we shall cormunica eto the police. As regards the consulates ve shallhave to take this question up with the F.O. In thecase of Gernany they were reluctant to disturbconsulates here owing to possible reciprocal actionagainst our consulates. In the light of what wenow know about one of the Italian Consuls in CanadaT think we shall have to consider the search ofItalian consulates in a rather different light.Godfrey has returned from Norway and gives rather apitiful story of the expedition. He mentioned oneinstance where a large box was supposed to containCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186y4sthe necessary material for blowing up bridges. Whenopened it was found to contain some apparatus fortouching off the charge but no dymamite. I hope tohave a talk with him and get more details.D.S.S. is writing to the H.O. regarding the note we aare putting up to the J.I.C. about the interrmentof aliens etc. He is stating that in view of thealtered circumstances he has had to revise hisviews of the urgency of this matter. He previouslywithdrew his memo since in view of what Maxwelland Newsam had to say he thought it would bebetter to defer action until the new ribjnals haddone their work. Since however the Fighting Servicesnow took a very grave view of the situationhe did not think the action he had previouslysuggested should be any longer delayed.Godfrey came in this evening. He gave a pitifulaccount of the Norwegian Expedition. After beingkept in an internment camp for 24- days at Dumfermlinehe eventually embarked on the Empress of Britain.He remained at sea for roughly 7 days before adecision was finally reached about a suitable landing-place. It seems that he went as far as Narvik and thecame down to Namsos. On arrival at Narnsos he gotinto touch with the local Norwegian police authoritiesbut did not find them very effective. They spentmost of their time in explaining that they had notfought a war for 120 years. He moved forwardwith Carton de Wiert's brigade to Steinkjer, andfinally further south, to a place called Verdas.At Steinkjer he found that the local police hadtaken a certain amount of action and that a numberof Quislings had been locked up. Having dealt withthe situation there as best he could, he virtuallyceased his security activities and became attachedto Carton de Wiert's staff. He seems to have beenemployed on almost every kind of job including thatCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18646of attempting to blow up a bridge and driving atrain. The troops behaved extremely well in veryadverse circumstances. Casualties were few. Cartonde Wiert pressed forward on the assumption that theNavy were going to deliver a smashing blow atTrondheim. This had been originally planned, butits obandonment had never been communicated to theland forces. The stores and equipment were deficientin all sorts of essentials. After 10 days and afterthe destruction of Namsos some A.A. A.A.guns guns arrived butwithout projectors. No man had more than 120 rounas aand all companies were deficient by half the fullcomplement of Brenn guns. There were no ski-ers.Some guns were deficient in ammunition. The G.O.C.had no staff for 10 days. There were no armouredvehicles. No reconnaissance by the R.A.F. for land-ing grounds were carried out until 2 days beforeour troops left Norway. Wireless commu ication hadto be carried out from H.M. .ships, mainly on accountof the difficulty of transmitting in mountainouscountry.I saw Arthur Pollen in the evening. He told me thatIceland was to be occupied tomorrow. There had alsobeen strong indications that Holland was to havebeen invaded yesterday.Mallet has telegraphed from Sweden to say that theSwedes are not giving iron ore to Germany at any ratefor the time being. They are however prepared tofulfill our contracts.Musso has the bit in his teeth. Lorraine has hadquite a heated discussion with Ciano, who was non-committal about the date when Italy might alter herpolicy of neutrality. He virtually said "Today,tomorrow, sometime, never".It seems that the move by the Ame rican Fleet in thePacific which wa.s given out as a precaution againstan attack on the Netherlands East Indies was takenCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186wu1at our special request.May l0thAt 6 a.m. the Night Duty Officer rang me up tosay that the eastern frontier of Holland had beeninvaded. The news reached him from the H.0. who hadhad it from the F.O.jutgI spoke to Cowgill regarding the possibility of theBelgian and Dutch experts over here to help uswith the refugee problem. He said that he would tryand get things moving. He did not advise us topress for OORSCHOTT as he did not think that thelatter would be able to bring any docuents withhim, neither had S.1.S. a very high opinion of hisability. Cowgill said that S.I.S. had bought allthe documents relating to the sabotage activitieswhich had been found on Germans arrested and thatthey also had a copy of the Dutch Black List. Iasked him to let us have the latter as soon aspossible in order that we could circulate the namesto ports. I suggested that the Dutch should beurged to transfer MOERZ (believed to have beenresponsible for the Venlo incident) and certainother people arrested to this country. We couldthen interrogate them at our leisure and also usethem as bargaining counters. We cannot I amafraid get Schulzer Burnett as he is on theGerman Diplomatic Staff. I spoke to D.S.S.and urged the necessity of pressing Bor immediateaction on the basis of our memo to the J.I.C.D.S.S. thought at first that it should be matterfor the D.M.I. but I represented that as theSecurity Service we should certaimly press ourrecommendations. I thought also that we should askfor the internment of the organisers of the B.U.F.An anonymous letter believed to be from a Germanhas been received by the H.O. It speaks of a planCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186448for an invasion by air and sabotage on the S.E.Coaston Saturday night. The alleged German said that hehad landed here some 2 months ago and he had beendeputed to carry out certain acts at Lee-on-Solent.In view of this message we are recormending theinternment of all enemy aliens in the East Coast areaand the restriction of ordinary aliens who haveentered these areas since the war. We are stilltrying to get H.O. to make a decision about dualnationals who are mernbers of the Fascio. There aresome 340 of these people who should all be internedin the event of war with Italy. Newsam has promisedto speak to the Home Secretary and let me have ananswer.May 11thWe had a board meeting today at which D.D.S. gavean account of his meeting at the H.O. last night -He went over about 4 p.m. and started discussionswith Newsam. Subsequently Dowson was called inand then Peake and Maxwell. Discussions vere brokenoff for dinner and resumed afterwards. MeanwhileJohn Anderson was holding a conference with CabinetMinisters,Under Secretaries of State etc. presimablyabout the re-shuffle in the Cabinet. At half-pasteleven Maxwell took his party, accompanied by D.M.I.,a representative of D.M.0., and McLeod of A.G.3. intoAnderson's room, and in front of the whole assemblygave Anderson details of the proposed action. Atfirst Anderson seemed disinclined to act. He saidthat he did not think the present emergency warrantedanything quite so drastic. It seemed that he wasthrowing a fly over his colleagues, a number of whomreacted very much in our favour. Walter Elliottand Colville took the lead. The former wa.s verymuch in earnest and sitting on Anderson's tablesaid "Look here,John, you must intern these people".Anderson told him not to get excited. Sorne of theCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/186others chipped Anderson by suggesting to him that hewould get a very good press in the Daily Mail.In the end Anderson decided to intern all male enennyaliens between the ages of 16-65 who were residingin any counties bordering the coast from north ofScotland to Hants. inclusive. Ordinary alienswere to be subject ot restrictions similar to thoseimposed on enemy aliens under Cat.B. and were tobe instrueted to report to the police every 24 hours.If the conditions did not appeal to them they ouldgo and live elsewhere.There was a statement in the Daily Mirror today thatwe had bought all the ports and Govt. establishmentsfrom the Eire Govt. for 50 million pounds. Wecannot get any confirmation of this from officialsources.A new regulation has now been passed to deal withrepatriated British subjects. They can be directedto report at a suitable centre and have theirmovements restricted or can be detained for a periodof a week and on special authority Bor 3 weeks.D.S.S. has sent a letter to the Home Office on thesubject of interring the district organisers of theB.U.F. and other important members of the Party.Mosley is included. Other kindred organisations ofthe Right are to be dealt with in a similarmanner as far as their organising staffs areconcerned. It will be interesting to see if theHome Office are prepared to swallow this pill.Ruben GLUCKSMANN, Austrian, is to be interned andKate R NK his British secretary of Polish origin isto go in under 18b. Both these people are connectedwith the Eastern Trading Co. which was forerly runby EHRENLIEB, the Russian 4th Dept. agent.Von TRESCIKOW has been released by the AdvisoryCommittee.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/1864s0.D.D.S. has discovered that while a British tbject isliable to a fine of E00 and 7 years penal servitudefor visiting enemy territory, an alien can go toenemy territory with impunity and at most can beinterned on his return to this country.The death penalty bill has at last been put beforethe House of Commons.Snow is still in touch with his friends on the otherside. He bad told them he could obtain the servicesof a trawler for communication. He was asked whatthe range of this trawler was.May 12thC.C.s have been empowered to sign orders under 80a..S.1.8. have given us a copy of the Dutch Black Listwhich we are having photographed and circulated toports.D.S.S. has been to see the F.O. regarding searchingItalian Consulates in the event of war. Jebb hasasked us to consult S.I.S. about the ossible reper-cussions. We are getting telephone checks onItalian consulates in London,Glasgow and Liverpool.Orders went out last night at 8 p.I. for the arrestof all enemy aliens in coastal districts. Therehave already been a number of complaints. Anelephant keeper in Bertram Mills circus at Southamptonis a German. They do not know what to do with theelephants. He has been treated as a special case ashe is moving shortly to Gloucester. Van's literaryagent Eric GLAS has been put in. He is making a nimportant propaganda film. Prince Lotkevitoh's servanwho says he is a Czech, has been eprested as a German.The harem of some oriental potentate at BrightonCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186451has been roped in. One LOEWY, who has set up afactory at Bournemouth to cost about E10,000 forsome contracts branch has himself been bodily removed.D.S.S. tells me that Maxwell has refused to considerour representations about the internment of 500members of the B.U.F. Later T had a long conversationwith th Newsam. I told him that I was very concernedabout our suggestion having been turned dow.He pointed out that it was still open to us to put upcases where any association was shown. It wasquite obvious from the general make-up of the Party,from its publications eto. that it was activelyassisting the enemy. If therefore we had not therecessary powers to deal with it we should get them.Newsam seemed to doubt whether any members of theB.U.F. would assist the enemy if they were able toland in this country. I said that I had not theslightest doubt that they would, and that theremarks of the Commissioner on the subject werewithout foundation. T told Newsam that there wereafter all some quite intelligent people in thisoffice who had given careful study to the matter andthat that was their considered view.May 13thIn view of my depressing conversation with Nevsamyesterday I have got Sneath and Dickson to preparea case on the B.U.F. in order to show that thewhole organisation is a hostile association. Whenthe case is prepared D.S.S. will see the Commissionerwith Canning, Sneath and Knight. It is hoped thento re-submit the case to Maxwell.I mentioned the H O. attitude to D.M.I. He said thatif we wouid submit the case tohim he would put it be-fore the J. J.1.0. 0. and press for action. T mentioned tohim the case which had been reported to us by theCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/186y52,Eastern Command. Apparently some kind of janming ofour A.A. wireless in the vicinity of Chelmsford andBallericay has been going on For some time.G.O.C. asked that all doubtful British subjectsshould be removed from the area and I have beenobliged to explain to him that this was quiteimpossible. The matter was reported to M.1.8.C.who promised if necessary to send down a detectingvan.The French 5eme Bureau are sending someone here todiscuss vulnerable points. Rothschild is tryingto get our list in order. There are dozens of fac-tories on the list but no attempt has been made toindicate which are the really important ones.Roger and T went up to see Leggett. He told me thattwo days previously he had visited Maxwell at therequest of his Minister in order to see what could bedone about certain communists. Maxxwell had takenthe line that it wa.s up' to to employers to get rid ofthese people. Le gett pointed out that the einployerwas only concerned with the man's ability or inabilityas a worknan and that it was up to the Goverrmentto get rid of these people if they were impeding theprosecution of the war. Maxwell talked a great dealabout the liberty of the subject and Leggett had toleave without having made any progress. Leggetthimself was very concerned about the whole position.He told Maxwell that not only the Trade Union leadersbut the majority of the rank and file would beentirely behind the Govt. in any action they tookagainst the communists. He thought however thatit would be as well for the Ministry of Informationor some suitable department to prepare the ground.Leggett told me that Bevin was caning in as Ministerfor Labour and he thought he would take very strongaction as soon as he got into offige. Leggett alsotold me that habour had made some very stringentCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186y53conditions before joining the Govt. A sine qua nonhad been the removal of Sir Horace Wilson fror thepolitical sphere.-in-C.Portsmouth was sent a sigal about thedistribution of communist leaflets in the town. Heasks whether this darnable practice cannot be stoppedin spite of the Home Office.A report was received from the French which indicatesthat rapid plans for sabotage in the Suez CanalZone have been worked out by the Italians. Theyinclude not only the blowing up of various works butalso the assassination of leading personalities.Torr M.A. in Madrid reported on April 16th that theSpaniards were likely to remain neutral in the eventof Italy coming into the war. Gen. .Yague advocatedassistance to Italy by letting her occupy theBalearies,southern Spain and Ceuta, so that she couldcontrol the Straits, but his proposals were turneddown by Franco and others of his Ministers. Yagueis pro-German and the Gerans ight try and plotagainst Franco in his favour.An S.I.S. report mentions the establishment of aGemnan submarine base near Vladivostock.By agreement with the Japanese Govt. Germnansubmarines would protect shippin routes toNorthern Japan.Another report states that the U.S.S.R. would notagree to the occupation of Swedish territory byGermany.Hitler told Musso at the erd of April that he wasgoing to make an offensive from the Swiss frontierBasle) to Holland in about 3 weeks and that hewould defeat the French army in 2 weeks.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS454ACT 1958.Another report on Spain says that the Council ofCivil and Military Chiefs in Madrid agreed on the12th Aporil to support Italy if she entered the war.The Germans are contemplating occupation ofRouania via Hingary. The latter is to haveTransylvania as a reward. The Russians are said tobe making preparations on the Bessarabian frontier.The Dutch arrests of De Graaf van ARENDHORST ad Dr.Otto BUTTING and Rost van TONINGAN show thatwidespread sabotage was contemolated.A report on Russia indicates that she edesires tofan the flames of war by giving limited supportto both sides and at the same time keeping out ofhostilities.May 14thGoering's nephew van ROSEN, a Swede, has arrivedhere. He was apparently in Germany two days beforethe invasion of Holland. He wa.s a K.L.M. pilotand had fought against the Russians in Finland.On his return from there he had seen Goeringwho was interested in his technical experiences.Sheath is looking iinto the case.One J. CARVELL of the F.O. is negotiating foranumber of Belgian Surete officers to come overin order to assist us in sorting out the refugees.Special material for the 12th May shows that theFrench and Allied forces including Dutch and Belgianshad up to that date accounted for 300 planes.The Dutch were thought to be resisting well at thatmoment and the British have apparently landed troopsin Holland. I believe they were Guards and onlyCatalogue CatalegueReference:kVi4/18bch are crying out for helpparticular for aircraft; which they vant to assistthem in the recapture of Rotterdam.May 15thDiscussed with Curry the question of raiding ItalianConsulates. Decided that we should recommend thisand the house detention of consular staff.Left for Droitwich at midday. Lunched atOxford with Tom Hutclinson where we discussedthe billeting of the staff. He undertook o-getin touch with local authorities, and see what wa.spossible.Arrived at Droitwich about 5 and found Archer at hisclinic. We told him that although-it-was-ouoriginal intention to discuss particular cases, recentevents in Holland had very much brought hom to usthe dangers of somet ing g-similar happening in Eire.There was this probability which had a certain amountof supporting evidence. Archer said that as far ashe could see there was nothing to prevent the Germanslanding in Eire and he did not see how any resistancecould be maintained for more than a-week. We thenasked him what he thought it was possible to do tomeet the situation. He said that he thought hecould persuade his ministers to lock up the 5thcolumnin Eire. He did not anticipate that hewould have very much difficulty in doing this.As regards organising for defence, some 30,000 menwere called up in December last and half of themdisbanded. He thought these could be called upagain and possibly another 30,000 who had sometraining in the use of ars. The difficulty wasthat they had no equipment. Orders had been placedin this country as much as 13 months ago, but it hadnot been possible oving to pressure of work forthe firs to fulfill them. He mentioned to me siteCatalogue atalogieReferencek4/f86r in the Government4$6it was thought that these ams were being intention-ally withheld owing to doubts about the use to whichthey might be put. Archer himself had arguedstrongly against this, saying that as Eire wa.sneutral she could not expect us to give deliverywhen we had so many other urgent calls uoon us.I gather that the principle requirements are Brennguns, ammunition, trawlers, coastal patrols andaeroplane parts.Realising that theequipment of this force might take weeks if notmonths even if the stocks were available, we raisedthe question with Archer as to the ssibibity ofsome sort of staff talks in preparation for apossible Geran landing in the interim. We told himthat in bur view it was a thing which might happenany day. He said that thats was a soldier and thatthis was more a matter for the politicans, but hesaw no objeetion to our putting it forward. Archerseemed to think that if the Germans landed in Eirethere would be genefal resentment and a certainamount of resistance but he thought there might bequite a nuber of people who would say "Oh, well, theyare here in force, we cant do anything about it"and be prepared just to accept the situation. Hewas quite emphatic that Eire would be thinkingabout her independance and that many people would notmind t.Britain getting a licking. On the other handsomebody who had expressed this view to him concludedby saying: "But what would happen to us if they did?i.Archer was quite interesting about the ComnunistsHe said that they were getting $150 a month from EarlBROWNDER of the American C.P. It was evidently a newdevelopment that this subsidy should come from theU.S.A. Some members of the Party were associatedwith the I.R.A. Our whole interview vras most friendlyand cordial, and before parting we promised to findout what negotiations had been going on between theGovt. of Eire and the British Govt.Ya to advise himaccordingly as to whether he should return to Dublinat the earliest opportunity.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/186457May 16thCecil and I left Droitwich at 8.30 and called inon Tom Hutchinson at Sarnesden. He had found outa lot about billets and would be ready to seeMarcus Heyward at any timne. We got back to the officeabout 1 O'clock.I found that during my abeense arrangements had been rmade to intern all Cat.B enemy aliens in theMetropolitan area. A suggestion had been madethat we should sort through all the Cat. C alienswho had been rernoved from coastal areas. D.S.S.said that there was to be a meeting in Newsam's roomand would se send someone from B. I sent Stephensand told him to say exactly wha't he thought. Heappears to have spoken very frankly to Maxwelland to have made an excellent impression. H.O.are going to let Cat.C stay where they are for thetime being.It seems that the J.I.C. have inade some very strongreccommendations about the internment of all enemyaliens and also of the Fascists and CommuristsD.S.S. has had a conversation with the commissionerand the case a ainst the B.T.F. is being worked up.Mosley's safe has been rifled and a docunent hasbeen obtained showing the whole scheme for settingup wireless masts in Germany. We heard about thisscheme more than a year ago. H.O. have sanc-tioned the internment of Italian dual nationalsin theevent of war with Italy, If they aremembers of the Fascio and are not below the age of16 or above the age of 60. We have certain excep-tions to the age limit who are members of the FascioDirectorate and sarctions has been obtained for theinternment of these people.Cecil and I went to see Lord Hankey at +.45. I gavehim the information that we had obtained froin ArcherCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186THS IS.ORIGINAt DOCUMENTI RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION48(4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSHe thought the 1958 matter was very importantand sent us straight on to see Lord Caldicott, atthe D.O. Ve explained the situation to him. Hesaid that Maffey was coming over that night andithatthere was to be a meeting in the morning. Maffeyhad already discussed the situation with De V.and the Eire Govt. were extremely anxious to obtainars. This aspect of the Question was being con-sidered by the Service Depts. There ha.d I gatherbeen doubts about the advisability of giving armsto Eire which mnight fall into the hands of the H.R.ACertain people in the Eire Govt. were inclined tothink that this was the real cause of their contractnot t_being fulfilled.Caldicott did not strike me as being very imaginativabout the whole thing. There seems to be littleanxiety in Govt. deaartments about the presentsituatipn. Few -people appear to realise theprobability of an invasion of this country and ofEireSnow has received. a message to say that RANTZOW willmeet him somewhere in the North Sea on May 22nd.Snow is to go out in his trawler if he considers itsafe, otherwise he will let the captain deliver themessage.

They are already in London.We have earmarkedto look after them-andto totake charge of the whole refugee problem. I hada few moments with Stewart. He told me that thesituation had been very critical the day beforeyesterday. The French were shouting for troops andCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1usgaircraft and were generally in a frightful flap.Winston had gone over yesterday to calm them dow.They have put General Giraud in charge and he hasundertaken to clean up the situation in the nextfewdays. He is I gather a real tiger. The newsis already better and it seems that the advancedmechanised column directed on Rheims has been cutoff. The 5eme Bureau were SO worried about thesituation two days ago that they had already beguto destroy their papers. Every unit in the GemnanAir Force has been identified on the WesternFront. It seems therefore that the Germans are put-ting their last ounce into the battle at Sedan.Their casualities compared with ours have been about3-1.Stewarth had some information, I gather of a reliableand very confidential kind, that Roosevelt wasproposing to give us 100 destroyers, somewhat out ofdate but nevertheless useful. He also proposed togive us a portion of his first-line aircraft, providedwe would replace them in due course with Spitfires.There is little doubt that Roosevelt would bring thewhole country into the war now if he possibly could.Holderness rang up to say that he had been asked bythe S. of S. to prppare a memo on the B.U.F. And son'colleagues had been pressing for the internmentB.U.F. members. I told Holderness that we hadprepared a memo for the - HO. a week ago recommending the interrment of 500 selected individuals butthat our suggestion had been turned down. It wasarranged that certain representatives from thisoffice should go to and help Holderness in his task.Cecil and I went to the D.O. to attend a meeting atwhich Sir John Maffey was present We discussed thewhole Eire situation.

V.V. hotly contested this and told Miaffthat he thought that he was under-rating the positioWe thendiscussed the various points which had been raisedby us in our discussions with Archer: Maffey saidthat similar points had been raised by DeV. who wa.sthoroughly alarmed. Maffey had suggested to him thahe should set his - house in order, both by dealing withe urdesirables and by improving his amaments.De V. had poirted out that the various contracts he3placed had not been fulfilled. Maffey was-veryanxto get him the stuff he required. It seemed howeverthat the Service Dept. S vere very unhelpful. Theysaid that they had not got sufficient to equip ourown anti-parachutists and some of then took the linethat ars if sent might fall into the hands- theI.R.A. and be used against us. Cecil made animpassioned speech stressing the importance of Eirefrom a defence point of view. It was from thedefence angle perhaps second in importance to theequipment of the B.E.F. Maffey entirely agreed.He thought however that it would be difficult tosuggest to eEire Goverrment that they shouldengage in staff talks unless he could offer themsomething in The way of amnaments.I lunched with Crocker. He is going very thoroughlyinto the question of leakage of inforation throughirsurance. He has already ascertained that consider-able leakage through these channels did take placeduring the last war.

I saidthat I felt our line should be to ensure that Dutchand Belgian refugees were not dissosed of all overthe country before their cases had been fully examinedby somebody who had a knowledge of the country andpeople. and the course the Belgian Ve of had a members day the necessary or two. of the The Dutch Surete ports experts vere could expected available pass inthe people over the Black List and if any wereaffected they could be sent to special receptioncentres but this did not mean that every Belgianand Dutch subject should L.ot be interrogated carefullyat some stage, If it isnot possible to put all theserefugees in one large concentration camo until theircases are cleared, I thought that at least they shouldbe placed-o Cat.F restrictions and should not- beallowed on any account to move from one area toanother. A1l those who hud already dispersed shouldbe ordered to recort at their reception centre forinterrogation. In addition to Dutch and Belgiansthere are a nuber of Germans arriving who are So-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186462called refugees from Holland and Belgium. Theyare being interned automatically. 70 have arrived atLiverpool today.I saw Stewart again today. He told me that thesituation two days ago had been extremely critical.The trouble was that the French did not fight. Theywere overwhelmed by the intensity of the bombing and itthe tank attacks. It seems to have been more aquestion of the terrifying form of attack rather thanthe actual damage inflicted. The situation todayseemed calmer and more reassuring. Then last nightwe bombed Bremerhaven, where very large oil storagedepots are. We sent over 132 bombers and 132 returnedIt is said that you could almost read a newspaperat the German frontier. The purpose of these bombingsof the Ruhr etc. is to draw the Geran bombersoff the French and on to this country where they eanbe dealt with adequately by our fighters, particularlyif they come at night. So far our bombing of Germanindustrial areas has not had the desired effect.This may be an indication that they have not sufficienreserves to concentrate both on the French Ary andon this country and that they are throwing theirlast ounce into the bulge on the Meuse. Stewarttold me an amusing story which came up on the specialmaterial. The Americans ordered 25 camnp beds fromHarrods, but as these were described as "cots" inAmerican, 25 babies cots arrived at the Embassy.An irate official told Harrods that he was talkingfrom an Embassy and not from a ereche.A large nuber of British ubjects who vere moreDutch and Belgian than British have arrived, havingpassed through a centre and are being interrogatedunder special arrangements.

He has been questioned but appearsto have been mostly in tears and frequently askedfor water. Cookie is carrying out the interrogationas the man is an Austrian. There is no doubt thathe is an important Soviet agent. All his answersto questions are conoletely unconvincing.The following arran ements have been made regardingrefugees from Holland and Belgium: (a) maleGermans and Austrians are being put into Pentonville.They will not be interned until we have marked themoff as of no interest. (b) female Germans andAustrians are being kept in Holloway. They are tobe isolated until we have passed them as of nointerest. (c) In the case of other aliens, M..5. willvet them at ports before they are dispersed toreception areas. They will be subject to the samerestrictions as Cat.B enemy aliens. (d) the caseof British ubjects returning from te ritory nowoccupied by the eneiny, they are to be kept isolatedfor 7 days pending enquiry and for a further 3 weeksif necessary.May 19thMaxwell has written a very stuffy letter about ourrecommendations to the D.M.I. which would betransmitted to the J.I.C. Committee. The J.I.C.had drawn up a memo on certain steps that theythought desirable against 5th colunnists. D.M.I.had asked for our comments. We had recommended(a) internment of selected members of the B.U.F.(b) internment of Cat. women (c) interrment ofnon-refugees in Cat.C and (d) internment of allCzechs resident in Germany and Austria prior to 1933.These suggestions were a consideraole modificationof those put forward by the J.I.C. We had sent acopy of these recommendations to Maxwell. Hethought that it was grossly improper for us to putCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS164ACT 1958Cunaeoforward any suggestions to the U.I.C. on policywhich affected the Secretary of State for HomeAffairs. 3 and he concluded his letter by suggestingthat we should withdraw our paper. D.D.S. spoke toBeaumont-Nesbitt and asked him to withhold the docu-ments from the J.I.C. until Monday when D.S.S. wouldbe returning and would deal with the matter himself.I think it is a good thing that is-issue has atlast come to a head. The real point is that whenthe whole country is virtually a military base forthe defence of which the fighting services are res-ponsible, it is our duty to keep them infored ofthe situation and let them know what measures weconsider should be put in force to deal with it.Knight has seen Hershcel Johnson-about Tyler-KENT,the employe of the American Embassy who is associatewith Anna WOLKOFF and has evideritly been gettingsecret documents out of the Embassy.

This was for the purpose ofdiscussing our position vis a vis the H.O. Edensaid he did not want to have a half-hour lecture fromJohn Anderson on the liberties of the subject, andurged D.S.S. to come to some arrangement with him.D.S.S. saw Maxwell and Anderson and it wa.s agreedthat we should keep the he.D.M.1 informed. Later inthe evening D.S.S. accompanied by Stephens attendeda meeting called by Attlee and Greenwood. JohnAnerson and Maxwell were also present. The diseussiwas already in progress. Greenwood and Attlee werepressing for some action to be taken against theB.U.F. Anderson was arguing on judicial lines sayingthat he had no evidence which would lead him tosuppose that members of the B.U.F. would activelyassist the enemy if they landed in this country.Stephens was very outspoken both on the question ofthe B. .F. and on the question of all enemy aliens.Anderson and Maxwell were rather annoyed at his out-burst but Greenwood and Attlee were evidertly veryeagre to hear what he had to say.At 7 p.m. today T attended a meeting at the 0. whichlasted until 8.45. Anderson, D.S.S. Maxwell,Peake,Brooke,myself and M. were present. Anderson had ouroriginal memo which was turned down about 10 days agoand wanted to have detailed information in supportCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186461of the various statements made. M. was extremelygood and made all his points very quietly andforcibly. I did not interfere at all except onon or two occasions. Anderson began by sayingthat he found it difficult to believe that membersof the B.T.F. would assist the enemy. He had beenstudying the recent number of "Action" where Mosleyappealed to the patriotism of its members. M.explained that this was merely an example of howinsincere Mosley really was and how many of hissupporters simply regarded utterances of thatkind as a figure of speech. He then went onto describe something of the underground activitiesof the B.TT.F. and also of the recent case egainstTyler KENT involving Maule RAMSEY. Anderson agreedthat the case against RAMSEY was rather seriousbut he did not seem to think that it involved theB.T.F. M. explained to him that Maule RAMSEYand Mosley were in constant touch with one anotherand that many members of the Right Club were alsomembers of the B.I.F. Other subjects dealt withwere the somewhat sinister activities of JohnBECKEIT and other members of the B.U.F. whoappeared to be collecting ars.Anderson said that he needed to be reasonablyconvinced that the B.U.F. mi ight assist the enemyand that unless he could get such evidence hethought it would be a mistake to imprison Mosleyand his supporters who would be extremelybitter after the war when democracy would begoing through its severest trials. I longed tosay that if somebody did not get a move on therewould be no democracy, no England and no Empire,and that this was almost a natter of days. Tdid strongly stress the urgency of the matter andsaid that surely,rather than argue the fine pointsof these various cases wasn't it possible to makeup our minds whether the B.U.F. was assisting theenemy and if we came to the conclusion that it waswasn't it possible to find some means of dealingwith it as an orgarisation. Anderson rather skatedCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186468over this but he seerned to have a great aversionto locking up a British subject unless he had avery east-iron case against him. He was hovreverT thiik considerably shaken by the end of themeeting. He asked us for further evidence oncertain points which he required for the CabinetMeeting which was to take place tomorrow evening.Either he is an extremely cal.m and cool-headedperson or he has not the least idea of the presentsituation. The possibility of a serious invasionof this country would seem to be no more than avague suggestion.May 22ndDiscussed last night's meeting and also thequestion of whether the P.M. should be informedthrough Morton. D.S.S. thinks we should not dothis but is himself going to have a talk withVan.A representative of the B.B.C. came here thismorning to say that in his opinion the New BritishBroadcasting station which is of course a Germanone, was putting over information in code.He had made a careful study of broadcasting methodswhen the Germans took Poland and also when theytook Holland. They had destroyed the Polishbroadcasting stations and had taken their wave-lengths. In the case of Holland they had left thestations standing and had taken them over.There were strong indications that in the event ofan attack on this country the New British Broadcast-ing station would try and monopolise the air andissue instructions and misleading information tothe public. Frost of the B.B.C. thought thatall infomnation coming from this station should goto some central point and should ybe dealt withby the civil operations branch and the militaryoperations branch. We arranged for him to go andsee Waterfield about this on the civil side andwarned the D.M.I. of the situation.Catalogue Reference:KV14/186LaThe last three days have been about the worstI ever spent for some considerable time. Thenews has been so bad that it made me feel physicallysick.

He seems to have left a good dealof his kit behind, for which the Treasury will givehim no compensation.D.S.S. has seen the A.G. who is going to makearrangements for the truculent prisoners to beremoved to some distant spot where they will beout of hanns way. They will not have facilitiesin future for listening to the wireless. T saidI thought they ought to have the opportunity ofhearing tonights broadcast which may damp theirardour somewhat.We appear to have been to some degree successfuin our mission to the H.O. yesterday. A selectionof leading B.I.F. members are to be interned,including Mosley, also other representatives ofthe parties of the Right including Maule RAMSEY M.P.All Cat.B women are to be interned forthvith.A1l aliens are to be put on very close restrictionswith a curfew. The cases of Czechs who residedin Gemany ard Austria up to 1933 and the casesof enemy aliens Cat.C are to remain in abeyancefor the moment.Catalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/186470New powers are to be obtained for dealing withFascists and Cormunists which will really meanrestoring 18b to its original state.S.I.S. material: one report mentions the possibili-ty of an attack by the Germans on the Faroes andIceland. The matter is apparently under considera-tion. It is rumoured that there is an agreementbetween Jugo-slavia,Rouania and Turkey, that ifattacked by Italy or Germany, Jugo-slavia andRoumania will retire to Bulgaria. The Russiansappear to be clearing the Bukovina frontier.Another report mentions a contemplated landingby the Gernans in Eire. Two rather significantreports have reached us today. One concerns a Dutycompany in Norfolk which acquired in 1938 a greatdeal of land. C.C. tells us that the hedges of anuber of fields owned by this company have beenremoved and give the impression of preparationsfor a landing ground. All roof's of the farm bui.ld-ings have recently been painted red. Orders arebeing given to arrest all the members of thiscompany.The other report is from .C.Buckswho says that an Egyptian of Turkish origin who hasrecently arrived in his area has also had theroof's of his farm buildings painted red and is inpossession of 2 dozen suits and 22 pairs of shoeswhich are stored in his barn. This has beenverified. Orders are being given for this manto be pulled in as well.There was a Directors' Meeting this morning.D.D.S. td us that a number of other ports werenow to be declared protected places and thatwe should also have to envisage the ossibilibyof the whole country being put under martial law.In such an eventuality M.I.5 would have to havea representative with G.H.Q. We already haverepresentatives with the Commands. It is antici-pated that Commands will give orders to the civilCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186u1lauthorities in any case where operations areaffected. They will not however give any long termpolicy instructions which will still be mattersfor the Home Office. The status of M.I.5. willalso have to be for consideration. It may bethat we shall all be militarised.The New British Broadcasting company from Hanburgmade an announcement this morning theb, withreference to the two parachutists who made a trialdescent in the northof England in order tosee the reaction of the public and were apparentlyroughly handled; the Geman station posing asthe B.B.C. announced that in future these peopleshould not be molested unless there were realgrounds for suspicion when the local police shouldbe consulted.May 24thA meeting was held last night at the offices ofthe Privy Council, with Neville Chamberlain in thechair. Others present were Attlee,Greenyood,Hankey,D.M.I. and Anderson. Chamberlain openedthe discussion by saying that he understood thatthere had been a difference of opinion between theJ.I.C. and the H.O. on the question of internment.He asked the D.M.I. to explain his views. D.M.I.very briefly sketched the outline of 5th columactivities in foreign countries and on behalfof the J.I.C. made the point that the wholesaleinternment of enemy aliens and the strictestcontrol of all refugees was necessary from themilitary point of view.John Anderson was asked to reply. To anyone whohad not made a close study of the sub ject, hisanswer created an atmosphere ofy confidence in hispolicy. He took the view that he was entirelysatisfied with the work of the tribunals, whichhad given the benefit of the doubt to the stateCatalogue Reference:KV14/18672and not to the alien. In this work the tribunalshad acted in the closest co-operation with thepolice and M.1.5. He was opposed to the wholesaleinternment and took the view that the right coursewas to break up hostile e-organisations by partialinternment and strict control of the remainder.He thought that largescale interment created ahotbed of intrigue. He expressed grave doutsabout the control of internees and prisoners of warby the military authorities and quoted examples.He visualised internment camps as organised Naziparties controlled by the Gestapo, and continuedin this strain, obviously making an impression onthe Privy Council. He emphasised the striet con-trol over entry into this country in the past,and concluded by saying that he had certain pro-posals which he explained. Logically and onlylogically he ought to proceed with the interrmentof women in Cat. and he had made arrangementswith the Governor of the Isle of Man for theiraccomodation. He further proposed to exercisestrict control on all aliens in this country whe-ther neutral, allied or war refugees or Cat.(enemy aliens. When asked by the Foreign Secretarywhat steps are being taken to deal with Cat.he replied that C.C.s were empovrered to bring insuspicious cases before the tribunals for dis-posal. The impression left on the meeting, althougthere was some support for the military point ofview, appeared to be that wholesale internmentmight well be untesirable, until the militaryauthorities had ensured absolute control of intern:ment camps. Immediate steps were to be taken toenquire whether Canada could not take a quota ofinternees. The D.M.I. was then asked if he hadanything to say and he expounded his view withsome support from the Foreign Secretary. It waSfinally agreed that the Home Home Secretary shouldcontinue to act on his own proposals withoutprejudice to further consideration of the majorproblems in the light of future conditions.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186unsIt seems to me that the only really valid arguentin the Home Secretary's defence was the inadequacyof the guarding of interment camps. Hisconfidence in the work of the tribunals isentirely misplaced. We at any rate know that theirwork has to a large extent been farcical.Statements to the effect that these tribunalshave acted in the closest co-operation with thepolice and M.I.5. are grossly misleading.Lastly his statement that strict control overthe entry of enemy aliens into this country hastaken place in the past has no foundation infact. Control has been.extremely lax, with theresult that we are saddled with a large nuunberof undesirables and other's about whom very lit leis known.Haylor has put forward a scheme for sorting outthe Czechs in this country. We pro propose ose to makethem fill in form D.R.17. We can then find outthe names of those who resided in Germany andAustria prior to 1933 and also the names of theSudeten Germans. Both these categories should beinterned and also the Corarunist officials of theCzech Trust Fund.D.D.S. disc ssed yesterday vrith Sir AlexanderMaxwell and Sir Philip Game at the H,O. the ques-tion of interning Cat.c enemy refugees,males, andif possible, single or childless females.Maxweil raised no objection in principal butpromised to lay the matter before the HomeSecretary as an urgent proposal. D,D.S. alsosuggested opening negotiations with Canada toreceivesome of our internees for whom no accomo-dation is ready. D.D.S. used as argument therather serious despatch from our Minister in Spain.The head of a mission who was on intimate termswith the German Embassy in Magrid said that theGermans regarded the 5th column as their newweapon and that the basis of it was the Jewishrefugees from Germany and Austria. It seems thatCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186474they had been approached individually in Scandinavi.sand the Low Countries and told that if they wouldwork for Germany they would be allowed to returnafter the war and their relatives in Germany wouldbe released forthwith. Otherwise they would beput on the Black List.The Police have interviewed KURK, who has givena fairly plausible explanation about the purchaseof property. It seemed difficult however to explainreasonably the purchase of 32 suits to his ownmeasure. His red paint has been analysed but doesnot apparently contain any florescent material. C.(is keeping him under close observation.The Dutchmen in the East Anglia Real Estate Co.have been arrested and their wives, and theyare being interrogated.I have been trying to formulate some plan of workin the event of our becoming a ind of activefield force. It is difficult to visualiseexactly how it will work. It may be that itwould be advisable to have a certain proportionof our staff either with commands or regionalcommissioners.May 25thWe have received a telegrain from the High Commiss-ioner of Eire stating that the house of MichaelHELD has been raided as a result of informationreceived about a parachutist from a German aero-plane. A parachute was found in the house, aGerman suit of clothes, $20,000 and a wirelesstransmitting set. The papers today have the storybut state that it is Stephen Carrol HELD who hasMr. been Costar arrested. who resides We are ta in ing Northunberland steps to deal and withwas in close touch wi th S.C.HELD.Catalogue ReferEnCe:KVI4/186usasper,Charles and T discussed last night futureplans. We came to the conclusion that we three,Curry and Dick should be at headquarters, butthat it might be for consideration whether otherofficers should not be attached to regionalcommissioners or at any rate by more or lessmobile. We were all agreed that for thispurpose we should have to treble our transport.At 12 noon on the 23rd the Egyptian Minister forwas in touch with Bastiani, was certain thatowing to oressure from the Royal Family and the Vat-ican, Italy would not fight. This does notaltogether coincide with information receivedfrom S.I.S. which indicates that the whole questionis still in the air. The Soviet attitude towardsGemany is stiffening. She does not want anoutright German victory.D.S.S. told me this morning that he had had aninterview with Neville who had questioned him on5th columnists here. D.S.S. told him that he wa.sworried about Czechs and also about other aliens.He then went on to see the P.M. The latter wasnot available owing to a meeting but Desmond Mortonwas there. It seems that the P.M. takes a strongview about the internment of all 5th columnistsat this moment and that he has left the HomeSecretary in no doubt about his views. Whatseems to have moved him hore than anythingwas the Tyler KENT case.D.D.S. tells me that he learns from Newsam thatall Cat. women will go in on Monday and that plansAre being worked out for some forn of internentof other aliens.At about 6 o'clock Stephens had a telephone messageasking that he and I should go up to the PrivyCouncil to see Atlee and Greenwood. I could notCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1864understand how they had got hold of my name. Beforegoing I rang up D.S.S. to ask his permissi.on.Itold him that I proposed, if T were questioned aboutinterrment, to tell them exactly what I thought.He agreed. Attlee and Greenwood gave me theimpression that they thought there was some politicalintrigue or graft in the H.O. which wa.s holdingthings up. I told them quite frankly that I didnot think this was the case. I went over the wholeground, explained how enemy aliens had been let intothis country freely for a period of 5 years, how theWar Book co tained directions for their probableinternment in categories imnediately after the out-break of war and how Sir Samuel Hoare had reversedthis policy early in September and substituted thetribunal system. This had meant that the organisa-tion of M.I.5 had been swamped and for the last 6months had been engaged on work of relatively smallimportance which had largely been abhortive.I said that in my view the reluctance of the H.O.to act came from an old-fashioned liberalism whichseemed to prevail in all sections. The liberty ofthe subject, freedom of speech etc. were all verywell in peace time but were no use in fighting theNazis. There seemed to be a complete failure torealise the power of the totalitarian state and theenergy with which the Gemans were fighting a totalvar. Both Greerwood and Attlee were mere-er-eeein agreement with our views. They said that theyhad been charged by the Prime Minister to enquireinto this matter.May 26thDick tells me that one of his Czech friends hasactually seen MORZ in London. We have circularisedhis photograph to the police and we are trying toget into touch with a irl who is known to be hismistress.The man who sent in the anonyinous rerpot which ledCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186477to the internment of Cat.C enemy aliens from thenorth of Scotland to Hants. has been identified.He is a British ubject and who fomnerly employedin A.G.4. He is a crook, but possibly he shouldnot be dealt with too hardly as he has got the H.O.to do what we have been trying to get them to dofor the last 6 months.There was tremendous excitement a.bout the EastAnglia Real Estate Co. Both the Air inistryand the Prime Minister have been making enquirielI got on to the C.C.Norfolk and asked him to havea thorough search made of the remaining farms. Hetold me that he had already searched two for thefarms and that there was nothing at all there and thathe demeanor of the wives of the two Durtchmen wasthoroughly satisfactory. The red roof's were ofordinary corrugated iron pattern and were receivedfrom the manufacturers in their present state. Theyhad not been painted by the company. In the mean-time the Eastern Command are ploughing up the wholearea and putting obstacles in the fields.We have received the documents in the HELD case.There is an elaborate questionnaire in good Englishbut in Geran handwriting, which shows that prepara-tions are being made for a landing in the north and aalso at Dingle Bay and Vertry Bay. We are interro-gating a woman named Mrs.COSTAR in the northwho was a friend of HELD.We have had a report from Lincs C.C. that the localorganisation of the B.U.F. is discussiog plans forassisting parachute troops.D.S.S. is to see Neville Chamberlain tomorrow.I have put up a note stating what we think shouldbe done to clear the ground for action here. Firstof all it is of paramount importance to get as manyenemy aliens and internees and prisoners of war outof the country as possible. Canada is the suggestedCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/186478destination. Secondly, we want to put the Ceechs inwith the exception of some 500 specially vouched for.As soon as po sible, the whoihe of the remainder ofCat.0 should be interned. B.U.F. district organisersnumbering some 500 persons, should be interned,if there is any indication of conspiratorialactivities. The Dutch and Belgian refugees shouldbe sent if possible to America.Investigations have been going on by us in conjunc-tion with the Ad iralty at Backton. They thoughtthat an old cable to Germany and Holland may havebeen tapped into from a bungalow on the clife whichis owned by a lady of German origin. Actuallythis does not seem very likely but thoroughenquiries are being made.Stringer is very worried about the New BritishBroadcasting Co. It is obviously their intentionto bomb us off the air and they are now preparingthe ground with the public SO that in such aneventuality instructions and false news can begiven. They are posing as an illicit stationhere which will help the British people in time ofneed.May 27thI lunched with V.V. He had some very cheering newsabout our Air Force and the exhaustion of theGerans. He said that they had extremely reliableinformation that things behind the line were nonetoo good, that the German Air Force had their tailsright down ard that they would not go uD exceptin formation. The effect of our attacles on Gerancommunic: tions had been devastating and the moralein the zear lines is said to be very bad.D.S.S. saw Neville Chamberlain. There is to beaHome Defence Committee on which D.S.S. and anybodyCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/186479he likes to take with him will sit. Colville villbe in he chair. H.O. will be represented by Maxwell.We shall now be able to state our views quite franklywithout having them bottle-necked through the H.O.It is a pity somebody did not think of this before.Brigadier Hawes of the Eastern Command called latein the evening. G.O.C. is apparently extremelyworried about the 5th column activities in hisarea. He picked up a map which was given him by the 3Lines police which seemed to indicate someplan for parachutists in the area of the Wash.G.O.C. thinks it of paramount importance that the 5thColumn should be interned imediately. BrigadierHawes wanted to know what support or advice wecould give him. He himself is prepared to go to thePrime Minister if necessary. I said that I thoughtthe best thing would be to get into touch with theD.M.I. T rang him up, told him that Hawes was here aand would like to speak to him. At the end of theconversation it was decided that D.M.I. would speakto G.I.G.S. with a view to an ultimatum being givento the Govt.May 28thThe New British Broadcasting Co. is throvring outhints to scare the public about an attack by gliders.There have beenssome terrific battles in Calaisand Boulogne and the B.E.F. seem to be dribbli.ngout.The blow today is the order of the King of theBelgians to his army to surrender. I gatherthat this matter had been under consideration for3-4 days and that the King came to his decisionafter hearing that the British Away intended to getout as best they could.Catalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/186480May 29thThe Italian Consul in Malta is burning hisdocumentsand has orders to be readyto leave.In the meantime there are diplomatic discussionsgoing on between ourselves and the Italians inRome regarding the exchange of internees in theevent of war. The cart seems to have got slightlybefore the horse. I cannot think why we do notask the Italians whether they are supposed to bemaking war against us or whether we are supposedto be making war against them.

V.V. madea very courageous bid for some statesmanlike moveto bring the north and south together in thepresent crisis. Swinton who was in the chair saidthat he would bring the matter to the notice of theLord President of the Council and would try andarrange Bor V.V. to see him. Various measureswere considered for tightening up censorshipand travel. Censorship is I think to be imposed 100per cent as soon as the necessary personnel can beobtained. Something like 1500 people are required.The test of 10-20 has apparently proved of interestExit permits are to be cut dow to those travellingin the national interest and something in thenature of a visa has also been gested. Thesematters are for the consideration of the D.O.It is not felt that much could be done with th PortControl. It is suggested to the Eire Govt. thatCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/186Eire subjects naturalised by decree should not beaccepted as British subjects.

Thereseems little likelihood of the French making anyattack from the south at any rate for the timebeing. Weygand has given orders that the presentline is to be held at all costs, but he does notentirely rule out the possibility of the Gemnansattempting another spear-head drive, which ifsuccessful would mean 7516 of France's industrywould be in the enemy's hands. Reyaud seemsgenerally more confident about the whole position.A report from Rome, said to come from the ItalianF.O. and W.O. indicates that the Germans are contem-plating an attack on the French from thedireetion of Sedan.

He hassuceeeded in getting authority for C.0.s toarrest enemy aliens about ahom they have even theslightest suspicion.We had a Board Meeting this morning. D.D.S. toldus that the Travel Committee had given orders thatthere was to be no tr vel to Eire except in thenational interest. The matter will be in thehands of the Military Permit Office. There is tobe an alteration in the constitution to give usthe right to refuse entry to this country tocitizens of Eire, who would have to obtain a peritfrom Maffey's office showing that they were cominghere on bona fides business. This recommendationis to come up before the Cabinet. Peake who waschairan of the Travel Committee was very stuffyabout having had this question foreed on theTravel Conittee. He wanted to know what authoritySwrinton's Cormittee had to interfere in matterswhich concerned the Home Secretary. D.D.S. told himCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186163that Lord Swinton was the Home Security executiveacting in an advisory capacity to the Prime MinisterD.S.S. said he had spoken to Lord Swinton aboutthe Irish problem generally and measures fordealing with it. He called in Capt. Hordern toget his views. Hordern said that short of sendingall these people back to Eire,which was obviouslyimpossible owing to the labour situation, hedesired to have much wider powers of search. Hehad put this up to Sir John Anderson who had re-fused it on the grounds that he was not goingto start a Gestapo in this country. D.D.S. pointedout however that the new powers of search forwireless should give Hordern all he wanted.These powers have only just come into force,although we have been trying to get then for months.We have also at last succeeded in getting thedeath penalty. This was about a week ago.The Arna WOLKOFF-Maule RAMSEY case is going to beinteresting. Anna WOLKOFF has come perilouslynear to high treason. She has obtained informationof vital importance to country from theAmerican Embassy through Tyler KENT. She has haddocuments photographed by a man called SMIRIOV,and there is some evidence to show that she hadpassed this infomnation to the Duca del Monte inthe Italian Embassy. She has moreover endeavouredto plant agents both in the censorship and M.I.5. There is little doubt that Maule Ramsey hasbeen cognisant of her activities.A number of reports have been coming throughboth froin F.O. and S.I.S. indicating that thelarge number of wounded irifting back into Geranyis having a tremendous effect on the population.People seem to take little interest in the countriesonguered but are gravely concerned about thecasualties.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/186464June 1stAn S.I.S. report states that Italy is trying topersuade France to drop the British allianceand inake a separate peace.We have 6,000 Norvegian whalers here who arecausing a certain amount of trouble owing totheir slightly pro-Nazi tendencies and reluctanceto work.

In the statisticalinformation given tows are mentioned and incertain cases the name is spelt out, sometimestwo or three times. He has been plottingthese places en a map and says that they aregenerally given in groups of three. A projectionthrough the apex of the triangle thus made showsthe location of coastal raids which are to takeplace next day. He claims that he had priorknowledge of the places wh ch vere raided on the eastcoast 3 or 14 nights ago. T.A.R. is not atogetherconvinced that he has solved the code, but all arremore or less agreed that the messages do containsome form of code, since otherwise they have littlereal meansing.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186490There seem to be a lot of people working on thisparticular job in holes and corners. There isno doubt however that: Frost of the B.B.C. is thebest qualified to handle the situation. He needsassistance but of the right kind. Difficultieshave arisen owing to the fact that M.I.8 are sup-posed to be responsible for plain Language codesand wish to imposea lot of soldiers on Frost to dothe work. Frost says he wants his own people.T have asked him to state the whole case in fulland have suggested that D.S.S. should take him tosee Swinton. In this way I hope that the wholequestion wi.ll be given the consideration itdeserves, and that other questions of policy arisingout of it may also be dealt with.Our Capt. .Bardwell has been feeling the heat andin a moment of exasperation broke several of hiscell windows.

Considerable colourhas been given to them recently owing to investi-gations into the case of one ALEXANDER who is talcinga commission on certain services which he says heis rendering in connection with residence,naturali-sation etc. I have always found it rather hard tobelieve that MacAlpine was anything but an indiscredfool very much under the thunb of his wife, butI am considerably shaken by the fact that twoH.O.files contain letters on an aliens behalf fromAlexander with a pencil note on them saying "Offici-al.To me" signed with MacAlpine's initials.A Fascist named Saxon Steir has been arrestedfor sticking up New B.B.G. advertising slips intelephone kiosks.

He said he haddone this in order to keep them as souvenirs.The possibility of his prosecution under section1 of the Treachery Act 1940 is being considered.The result of the suggestion in the document pickedup on the railway lines near Manchester that cara-vans might be used either for wireless coinmunicatioror for arns is that we have moved the H.O. to ordera gereral search of caravans throughout thecountry.Catalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/186wasHad a long discussion today with FROST of the BBC,Stringer and T.A.R. about the N.B.B.O.

By this I mean the borbing ofour broadcasting stations. off the air, and thebroadcasting of false news and instructions.We have decided to place the matter before theSwinton Committee.Frost strikes me as an extremely able and knowledge-able person. For 5 years he has made a very closestudy of foreign broadcasts, and particularlythe Geran. He says it is quite a simple matter toforesee in gereral terins what the German purposesare. At the momer he thinks they are concentratingon fritening tis so tha't ve shall not send more troopto France. He thinks it quite possible that Italianaction may be operating in the same way.

There were 37 on the list who had beenCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186down for arrest as suspects. We reduced these to11. It was considered essential that consuls shouldbe given facilities to communicate with all thepeople on their list in order that they might begiven instructions about their departure from Glas-gow on Thursday evening. said that this was notof course satisfactory from a security point ofview, that it had been agreed to place the consulsunder house arrest and cut of their telephones, thereason being that the consulates were the organisingcentres of the Fascio and that documentaryinformation had been received that the Fascio inCanada and one of the local Consuls were planningacts of sabotage. It was now proposed to releasethese very individuals and allow them to wanderabout the country and make their way to Glasgow fora period of 48 hours. The genera] view of themeeting, with which T could not agree, was that theycould not do much harm. T said that if these werethe orders of higher authority presumably they hadto be accepted. Orders were given to resume tele-phone communication and to remove the restrictionsor house-arrest. This was considered essential ifthe party was to be organised to leave on Thursday.We had of course expected that our suspeets would bearrested, handed over to the military. ad then sorteout as bargaining counters. Parties of them coul.dthen have been sent to the ship under escort.June 12thAt the board meeting this morning we unanimouslyagreed that our policy with regard to enemy aliensshould be their wholesale interrment followed bytheir removal from the country as and when thismight become possible. Our object is to clear theground as far as possible in the event of an invasiorof this country. We do not necessarily believe thatthere is a high percentage of 5th columnists a ongthese people. There may be a few. Our main pointis that as a category these aliens will be anCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/186anembarrassment if hostilities commenced in thiiscountry.At 12.30 T attended a meeting of the J.1.C.who were protesting against the facilities beinggiven to consular staffs and also to the Embassystaff. They were I think quite right in principlebut in the light of the circustances perhaps theirpoint of view wa.s a little exaggerated. Theyregistered their protest which I gather reached theLord President of the Council in the afternoon.A compromise was reached by which consularstaffs were to be allowed to telephone out wereto be kept under observation both as regards their Cconversation and their movements.The prec-tical effect of this is of course il.Since the const-lates have a number of people On their staffs, thetelephone girl cannot po ossibly know whether theirconversation is indiscreet or rot and the localpolice cannot possibly keep them all under observa-tion.T lunched with Desmond Morton, Jasper and Charles.Desinond wa.s full of titbits of one kind or anotherand very ermphatic that we should keep our end upwith the H.0. and not fall into the trap of com-promise. This is contrary to the advice that wehave received from the late D.S.S. and D.D.S. whosay that we shoul.d watch our step very carefullyas both the H.O and the military were gunningfor us. Desinond told us that Swinton'sinstructions were that his committee eould summonanybody with or vithout the consent of theirchief, that they could frame reports on any subjeetaffecting security and that if they could not gettheir requirements met by the minister concemedwithin 6 hours they should report to the PrimeMinister. Desmond said that he had been astoundedby the ignorance of people in high places aboutsubjects which had been common knowledge in theIntelligence Services for months if not years.He ascribes this very much to the clogging formCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186,408of bureaucracy. My own view is that it comes frora system of sending always for the head of adepartment, who cannot po sibly be au fait withthe mass of detail or present the picture that thespecialist is able to. Desmond mentioned particu-larly the situation in Eire. Until V.V.s peoplesaw the Lord Presidert, he was obviously in almostcomplete ignorance. He now realised what theposition is and V.V.s courageous suggestion at theSwinton Committee is being adopted, namnely, Craigavorand De V. are to be asked to come over to consultjointly with ourselves on measures for the defenceof Ireland.At 1.30 T went to a meeting with Jasper and Swinton.We discussed the nev sub-conmittee which is todeal with 5th column activities. Swinton's idea isthat Joe Ball shall be more or less in charge andthat they should be what he describes as a "thinke-ing conmittee". It should throw up ideas whichmay lead to investigation and possible counter-measures, and to suggest avenues of enquiry,This is rather different from what was originallysuggested, namely the kidn of B.branch committeewhich covers all the manifestations of 5th column.I explained exactly what we had to compete ithin this direction and laid particular stress onthe New B.B.C. I told Swinton that we wantedthree things, first of all, that he should seeFrost personally and arrange that he should be incharge of a small committee which would trr andwork out the code and also that he should be availeable for consultation on a cornmittee which cantake action on the interpretation of the variousbroadcasts which are coming in Now. There wouldseem to be a further need, namely some kind ofauthority for taking up the wider issues involved,i.e. counter measures and protective measures, waysand means of cor nicating with the public etc.if we were bombed off the air. A good deal hasbeen done already but there is obviously more to itCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186u9a.Swinton was very sympathetic and when got backto the office I found that he had already rung upFrost who was going to see him, either tonight ortomorrow.We have I think converted Swinton to our viewabout the enemy alien situation. He apologised forthe last meeting but pleaded that he vras Jlyfighting a lone hand. We explained to him ourviews. We were not asking for internment becausewe thought that a large percentage of theenemy aliens were Geran spies but because vethought they were better out of the way forobvious reasons. Swrinton proposed to take thismatter up again. He is also writing a reply toJohn Anderson's letter about the Czechs and willlet us have the result.June 13thAt the board meeting this morning I explainedabout the Italian situation and suggested thatHarry should warn the soldiers that there wasa proposal to dump back in Italy as many Italiansas we possibly could. The F.O. idea is that thesepeople wi.ll form focal points of dis-satisfactionparticularly those who have been earning goodmoney in this country. Our view is that providedcertain specialists are held and in particularany members of the Fascio, there is no objectigto the proposal which may indeed be a sound one.Baxter is going out to western command andregonal commissioners area today on a recornoiteringexpedition.

A certainamount has been going on but it is in a way remark-able that there has not been far greater activity >particularly as regards ships. It is of coursepossible that an organisation is lying low awaitingthe moment of maximum embarrassment. PersonallyI think the I.R.A. are more likely to be concernedthan any other body.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/186509The Air Force produced two very sinister photo-graphs taken from the air. One hed the appearanceof an arrow, said to be pointing in the directionof an Ordnance Factory. It led from a church saidto belong to the Unden Order. Thee some 20 milesaway, was a bow in the middle of a plantation.Everybody on the Swinton Committee became wilalyexcited. Investigations have been carried outwith the following results: The Unden Order turnsout to be the Undenominational Church, and when itwas built the local borough council insistedthere must be a car park. This car park madethe head of the arrow, which broadened out rathernaturally at the tail, where the anive came u tothe front of the church. There was a wireless rece:ving set in the church but it could not ever pickup the national broadcasts. There was a piece ofpaper denoting that a Mr. Tucker, local represen-tative of the P.P.U., was also a member of the churbut this of course is exactly where ore wouldexpect to find him. The bow was in the mi iddle ofa pheasant covert on Lord I1 iffe's estate. Ithad been there since 1923 and showed up white onaccount of the chalky ground. Its purpose wasto provide food for the pheasants.

The framing of thisorder is causing some difficulty owing to the useof this apparatus extensively for medical purposes.It is a real danger from the Air Force point of viewas not only can the apparatus act as a beacon tohostile aircraft but also as transmitter.A scheme for internment of enemy aliens Cat.cis being put into force and will begin about the24th. This is evidently the result of an interviewbetween D.M.I. and Harry Allen wi ith the Home Secre-tary.

It isquite clear that the Gemnans are flying on a beamand that KLnkebein is some apparatus which isused by an agent and whi.ch tells them exactly whenthey are over their target.With regard to the N.B.B.S. there is anothersinister feature. When the broadcast comes overfaintly, it is repeated the following day, on theexcuse that the transission was bad on the previousday. This seemns to imply that there is rapidcommunication from this country to Germany.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/1865osThe question was raised of wireless sets in foreigntrawlers. It was pointed out that Belgian trawlersgo out with wireless sets and can quite easilycomunicate wi h the enemy. R.S.S. are keepinga watch on these but this was generally felt bythe meeting to be unsatisfactory.A.D.N.I. was not sure whether the wireless setshad been removed or whether they had only beensealed up. The matter is being gone into.The meeting was unanimously of opinionthat the sets should be confiscated.The question of alien seamen was discussed. Wepressed for the internment of aliens seamen who wereeither unemployable or unwilling to work. Thepresent policy of the H.O. seems to be to attemptto absorb these people in industry. The situationis not very satisfactoryand we are going to pursuethe matter with the H.O.100 bombers came over last night. 7 or 8 were shotdow.

TheCommand S.C.O. will in future pass all hisreports to Mande and Younger for investigationbut he would like to be kept informed of thegeneral trend of affairs in the area in order thathe can keep the soldiers quiet. He says thatour first bulletin has had a very sobering effectbut evidently there is mueh to be done in thisdirection.June 21stT attended the Swinton Committee, which is gettingrather cunbe some. There was a lengthy discussionon relay stations. It was agreed that receivingsets should be under proper control; but that transmitting stations were not much of a dangerbecause an ordinary portaole transmitter would bemuch more suitable. At present these relay stationare being made use of both by A.R.P.., C.C.S, and ina very small way by the military. There arealtogether 280 relay companies. It is suggestedthat the small ones who are not properly controlledshould be closed down. As regards personnel, thiswas considered to be a security matter. M.I.5vere to issue a circular to the police asking themto vet and pass on any doubtful cases. Diathermywas discussed again. It is suggested that anorder prohibiting the use of any set, and thatimmediately temporary exemption certificatesshould be issued to hospitals. There vere howeverstill a nuber of details to be worked out. Itwas ag eed that the follovring action should been,namely the issue of an onder to the e fectthat anyone having a set should report the factimmediately to the police. We raised the pointthat it was the people who actually used the agarCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186507ratus who vere the danger. They therefore ought to bevetted by the police in the first instance and subse-quently by ourselves if they appear suspicious. Itshould also be made clear in the order that when alicence is granted the set can only be operated bycertain specific persons.Desmond Morton informed the meeting that shiploads ofpeople might be arriving from France. These includedexperts, ex-cabinet ministers, armed soldiers etc.These would be picked up as and where possible andmight be dumped at any port. The meeting wasunanimously of opinion that since the Ministry ofHealth ha no accommodation available: the militaryshould undertake to keep these people in 8 guardedcamp until there had been an opportunity of lookingthoroughly into their cases. Foreign soldiers wouldgo to a military camp, stragglers being vetted at theport and again at the camp. Civilians would go to aseparate camp.Morton also told me that members of the renchPurchasing Commission over here who were in possessionof extremely valuable documents, had drawn the atten-tion of the authorities to the pos sibility of theirgoing back to trance and the danger of some of theirmembers being subject to pressure by the Gestapo.It has been decided for the momert to revent theirleaving the country. It may be necessary to internthem, as a preventative measure.A report on the N.B.B.S wa.s examined, the questionof lights was again discussed and we put forward asuggestion that there should be a curfew in countrydistricts. It would then be an easy matter to round upany offenders. The Air Ministry think they wouldlike to consider this.T dined with Frost and Herbert and we had a long con-versation about the N.B.B.S. and the pOsSibilities ofimproving Co-operation with ourselves.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/186FesJune 22ndWe had a board meeting this morning on the question ofthe B.TT.F.

He told me that fromall sides he wasgetting reports about the tremendousdamage done by our air raids in Germany. We discussedthe case of the wireless set wnich had been heardopert operating ting from the Hungarian Legation. The Hungarianminister had been seen by Cadogan and had admitted quitfrankly that he had had a wireless set since thebeginning of the war and that it was the mos't conven-ient way of cormunicating with his goverrment. He wasunder the impression that many other legations in3udapest were doing the same thing, including theBritish and he suggested that there should be areciprocal arrangement. It is in fact true that S.1.S.have a set operating from our legation and probably weshall have no alternative but to acquiesce in theHungarian Minister's suggestion. What shook mewasthat we only discovered the existence of this seta fortnight ago, whereas in fact it has been operatingsince the beginning of the war.June 2thWe have formed a new section under Bracman-White todeal with the Celtic movemen'ts. The Germans hadobviously done a good deal of work in the Breton 1ove-ment and it may be that to some degree they havedone the same here. We have a certain anoun't of information about these various mnovements a.nd the individualconnected with them but it may be wel.l to develop thisside.We have drastically cut down our vetting; which hadpractically paralysed the work of the office. Insteadof looking up all records, we now only cover theCommunist and Fascist indices.Maude has discovered that the military, particularlythe 55th Division in the Eastern Couyities havebadgered herlocal police into giving them a listof people with whose bona fides they are not altogethersatisfied. If and when the balloon goes mp theCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186military intend to take the law into their ownhands and arrest these people. We have got haldof these lists which do not seem to have much inthe way-of a comonsense basis. One man's on]ycrime appears to be that he is a dentist. Anotheris a member of the P.P.U. The P.N. had apparentlyheard of these lists and was wondering why thepeople had not been arrested already.June 25thAt Liverpool seeing the children off.MacPhai] was most helpful. hed a talk withhim about his work. He finds it extremely difficultto get on without some Tore officers. He wouldbe quite satisfied if some of his F.S.P. and S.C.0.scould be promoted. The di ficulty is that howeverintelligent they may be people will not pay anyattention to them unless they are officers.June 26thThe question of naturali sed.British sub jects ofenemy alien origin has been discussed. The sugges-tion is being put forward to the H.O. that all thosewho have been naturalised within the last 7 yearsshould register wi th the police. There is a furthersuggestion that all dual nationals should register.We have decided to ignore for the moment enemy alienwomen married to British subjects.We have official approval for our policy withregard to communists engaged in ca' canny infactories. Managers are to get in touch with theDistrict Organiser of the T.U. vrith a view to get-ting his support in the event of the man beingdismissed.The legal espect of interrogating people underarrest has been considered. It has been de cidedthat we must interrogate and run the risk of theinformation obtained being so incriminating as toCatalogue ReferEnCe:KVI4/1865,2prevent us proceeding vith a prosecution.Mosley is to come before Birkett's commit Mes andwe are considering whether there is any way ofgiving some publicity to his case. If it werregenerally know in the B.U.F. that he had arrangedwith the German Govt. to broadcast propaganda tothis country and incidentally to transmit fundsfrom Germany to the B.U.F., the rank and file mightthink very differently from what they do nov.This office is being absolutely inundated vrithridiculous en miries from every possible quarter.The worst come From the highest circles. We haveasked D.S.S. to try and get some broadcast urgingthe public to report more accurately and to takesteps to verify their facts as far as possible befodoing so. T have also suggested that somethingshould be done to ensure that stories are fullysifted here before being passed round to the P.N.,Cabinet Mini ters and other officias. We are nowharrassed by a number amateur detectives in highplaces. The bow and arrow story is still goingon and we have had to ansver a 5-page letter fromAntony Bevir, the P.M.'s secretary, who s.stillunconvinced. I really think it must be acceptedthat we probably have more experience of nare'snests than anybody else. I have asked D.S.S. totake the matter up with Lord Swinton.At a meeting of the Swinton Comittee today it vrasdecided:(1) to issue a circular to C.C.s urgingthem to use their powers of search more fully. Infuture it is to be sufficient to have a vague uneasfeeling about an individual. (2) that alien seamenshould be segregated in districts and be underclose control. Those who are considered pro-Nazi amto be interned. (3) Somne 8,000 French dockhands andarsenal workers have been landed here and are to rremain at a military camp at Aintree. Efforts areto be made to get rid of them as soon as possible.Some of them are rather bolshy.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/186512(4) the internment of enemy aliens is to proceedon the following lines: there are to be 3 waves, thefirst one non-refugee unemployed, second all malesin the provinces and thirdly all males in theMetropolitan and City Police areas. Subsequentlythese people are to be sent abroad. Canada willtake 7,000, Newfoundlan 1,000, Jamaica up to 10000and Australia almost unlimited numbers. (5)Germanwomen, of whom there are about 30,000, and Italianwomen, 8,000, will be sent to the Isle of Man, assoon as the males aare sent abroad. The matterof getting rid of our adult refugee opulationis considered to be more important than the arrangements for evacuating children. (6) Members of theB.U.F. to be taken over by the military.

(9) Infuture no refugees are to be Ilowed to land untilthe question of the value of the ship an itscontents have been considered.

On the other hand we may tell theship to go about and dumo its refugees elsewhere.(10) oFrenchman is to be allowed to travel. renehwomen can emigrate to Canada or America. Frenchcitizens generally are to be treated as ordinaryaliens,subject to curfew and other restrictions.June 27thI spoke to Bourne of the Post Office. He has takensteps to clean u cases of B.U.F. members employedin the P.O. either by bringing about their internmentor dismissal or alternatively heving them movedto some harmless occupation.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186SixE have spokert to B1O and suggested tha't they shou2dlook into the former comeotions of the GemnanMilitary and Air Attaches. Experience in Hollandshows that these people worked oub quite a netvrorkbefore the crisis. have allso suggested that weshould go over our lists of visits by German fricetto this country and check up on some of thepeople with whom they stayed.I dined with Anthony Pollen. He brought with himone MORGAN, who is the general manager of theLondon Insurance Co. and head of a committee whichworks under the Mnistry of Food and B.O.T. forthe purpose of ensuring all essential moitiesof the country. This committee has informationshowing the quantities and location of all theseconmoigities. ISS records are therefore of a veryvital kind. NORGAN told me that he aid not thinkthere could be very much that the Gerans did notknow since our main storage depots vrere more arrlessa matter of c mon knowledge. e.g if anyoody inhis line of business was told that we had a milliontons of wheat in the country and vas asked yiherethey were stored, he would say at once there couldonly be 2 places, Liverpool or Southanoton. He colme that the Germars have not had the opportunity ofgetting much inforation for some time throughinsurance but that we on the other hand had obtainedn complete records of the location etc. of aln thevi al industries in Germnany and that these hadbeen handed over lock stock and barrel to theAir Ministry,June 28thHordern has seen Sir Kenneth Leigh of the Ministryof Information about the Joint Broadcasting ConmitteLeigh seems to be thoroughly dissatisfied withthis organisation and would be quite glad to see itliquidated.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/186515We have established contact with the PolishCounter-Es ionage organisation who will help USto deal with the Polish refugee question.We are being strongly pressed to complete ourRegional scheme. Our great difficulty is Lackof experienced officers.June 29thI lunched today with Rothschild and Sir GeorgeGaytor, who is P.U.S. to the Ministry of Supply.He is an extremely nice person and obviously veryread to be helpful. He had not apparently got avery good idea of the work of M.I.5. He wasevidently worried by the fact that we had turneddown certain people for employment who werre ofcommunist tendencies. I explained to him that thiswork had of necessity to be done by rule of thunb,that we W ere not all Blims,tha't we would be veryglad to review any case with which he was not inagreement. He was extremely sympathetic and Ithink had entirely altered his view about ouroffice. He is evidently undergoing moredifficulties in his OwIL Ministry, but it is quiteclear that this is now beginning to tale shape.He said that it was not generally realised thatalthough it was decided to form the Ministry inApril 1939 it did not start work till the begining of the war. Even now it on3y coves W.0.contracts and a few of those which are common toall three Services. We discussed the questionof machine tools, and T explained exactly whatour fears were. A1l we wanted was that our viewshould be given due consideration. After that, itwas up to somnebody else to say whether the riskshould be taken in the interest of urgency ofproduction.June 30thCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186$6John Maude called in today. Things seem Ovbegoing quite well in the Eastern Counties regionand he is on the whole satisfied what there isnothing very serious going on at the moment from the5th Column point of view. The anxiety of themilitary is being gradually allayed.He is having some difficulty with Mawhood, theEasters Command Security officer who seems anxionsto cover the whole area with another network ofintelligence officers. Personally T can see no usefor the Command Security Officers except in so faras they may act as a kind of brake on the soldiers,through keeping them assured that things are beingdone and that of the many rumours which are circu-lating, the ma jority are ill-founded.John had a visit from one of Mawhood's IntelligenceOfficers the other day; who when asked what hisfunctions were said that he was concerned with civilintelligence in the area. He seemed somewhat vagueabout his duties, and in fact when challenged saidthat he had orders from Major Mlawnood not to letJohn know what he was doing. This all seems verybad and will have to be cleared up. It seems to methat the less these inexperienced people prow] aboutthe country the less likeldhood there is of stupidenquiries being made.John was very amusing about a certain iajor Fovlerof the L.D.V. who had got a corpl.ex about lightsgoing up during air-raias. He had witten a letterto Brigadier Hawes who was equally concerned. Johnsid he thought it would be vell to make MajorFowler' acmaintance, and probe the story as faras possible. He went out to his place with Dixone evening last week. They had not been talkingfor long when the yellow warning Came through.They sallied forth, the lajor heavily amned andcrept along the banks of the Ouse. The Major waseven afraid that the rustle of the grass mightCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186511disclose their whereabouts to an enemy agent.They spoke in whispers, ard after creeping about fora considerable time, returned home having seennothing. At one moment the Major crept on hishands and knees towards a curious noise that he hedheard. It turned out to be 2 swans and cygnetsfeeding on the banks of the river.A good deal of trouble and excitement was causedthrough a farmer who had a new form of bird-scaringapparatus. It consisted of a piece of stringwith souibs attached to it at intervals.It was hung from a tree ard thought to be mostsinister. As the string bured it ignited thecrackers which went off and scared the binds.July lstMind's a blank.July 2ndThe whole office has been turned upside down by aspy scare. A message camne through of a very circuestantial kind during the night to the effect thata German parachutist had been eanght with addresseson him which indicated a widespread organisation.Another parachitis was said to have escaped.Cookie,T.A.R.,S.I.S. and the Centre boys dashed ofin cars to the Oxford area where the Canadiansere injcontrol. The place wa.s also visitedby the C. in C. and a number of unfortunatecivilians are already under arrest. In particularthe occupants of a neighbouring farm who eployedalien labour. These people were only being lovedto milk the cows uer guard with fixed bayonets.Meanwhile their house had been turned inside outby the Canadians who had, dru k the whisky andfinished everything else which gaught their faney.The story looked promising at first, even thoughthe Gernan turned into a Welshman. Somebody in theCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186LeD.V. had reported that parachutists were deseending,the Canadians had turned out in force to look for thenand had discovereda man under a bush vrith a bicyeleeating.8 piece of bread. He was inediately pouncedupon and said that he had been brought in an aero-plane with another man from Le Bourget and that he wasa Welsh prisoner of war. An aeroplane had been heandthat night in the vicinity but it was no't apparentlyof a type that would nomally have been used forthis purpose. The alleged parachutist was interro-gated again and ended by te ling 3 difrierentstories. The truth eventually emerged. Hawesreally a deserter and when taken by the Casadianstothought that his first story would provide a wayout. His Sergeant-lajor identified him and he washanded over to his unit. As usual there yes greatexcitement in high quarters and everyoody was jumpingto, all sorts of conclusions, before the incident hadbeen properly investigated. Others were indigantbecause they had not been told.The Canadians do not appear to have been very impres-sed by the way the whole matter vas handled out theydo not seem to have behaved awfully well themselves.They are I think in a general state of impatienceinregard to arrangements over here. They do notseem to think tha we are any good, and tha we movethem about from place to place for no particularpurpose ete. There may well of course be a good dealin what they say, but my experience of em in thelast war wa.s that they were alvays very eager to shovreverybody else how efficient they were by comparisonwith ou selves.July3rdAt the Board Meeting today I said thet in the presentcircumstances it is a ite impossible for us tocontime ve ting at the present rate and also to dointelligence work. Although the regis ry was to bemechanised with a view to easing the situation, itCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/186519it was quite certain thet that would not really meetthe case. Our vetting Figures are 50,000 a monthand there seems no reason why we should vet theArsenal and Dockyards any more than ve should vetVickers and Rolls Royce or any other fir. Thewhole country is now in fact an arsenal. The matteris to be out to Lord Swinton who will request theService Depts. to release us from our obligations:The Intelligence Centre of the Swinton Committee israther getting on my nerves. From the orgganisationalpoint of view it is obviously a mistake to havean outside bodynaking demands for investigationshere whic are not considered in relation to theother work we are doing. It seems to me that eitheethe Intelligence Centre should come here and mun theoffice or that they sho 1d merely pass on anythingthat comes to their notice and leave it to us to de-cide whether it is worth investigating or not. Inits present form it is really rather pandering toth cold neurosis, which is perhaps one of thegreatest dangers with which we have to contend atthe moment.rother mare's next was investigated today. Afemale had communicated with a male at a certainLondon telephone number. The male voice said "Goto the road which is cal.led after the name of ariver proceed along it until you see a red flover-pot.

He was deliberately trying to stop the menfrom working overtime. 18b is not our normalprocedure but the case was such a flagrant one thatit was thought better to proceed in this mater.Jily Jily 5tT.A.R. has been down to see the Canadians again amhas told them the results of our investigations intothe case of the parachutist. They seem very bitterabout things in this country. There is evidentlystrong feeling that we are not getting dosn to it,and in ome ways think they are quite right. Theydo not seem to have much faith either ir our administration or in our higher command. T have suggestedto T.A.R. that he houl.d pass this information on tothe D. I.Three French sailors are reported to have beenattepting to dissuede their compatriots from joiningde Gaulle. The facts were reported to us by aSecurity Officer. I gave orders for these men to bearrested. The sequal was a visit to the camp bysomebody from the French Embassy who said that theyshould be released at once, followed by a visitfrom somebody on De Gaulle's staff who said theyshould be detai ed. To complete the picture theAir Force rang up about them, presuabbly because theywere sailors. There is no very clear procedure atthe moment for dealing with soldiers,aime or nava]ratings who make difficulties of this kind.July 6thIt ha.s been decied that the French officers are to beallowed to leave after they have been vetted by us.It is difficult to see how we are going to be in aCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186"yr\position to say anything about them.Gooch tells me that the Japanese Consul in Liverpool,BEPPU, has established himself in Dublin and Left hisVice-Consul to carry on in Liverpool. BEPPU Beseribeshimself as a consular courier. I is interesting thatthis arrangement bas been ma.de subsequent to thedeclaration of war by Italy. It seems faily clearthat BEPPU will now be acting as a courier betvreenthis country and Eire for the Axis Povers. Gooch hasgone up to Liverpool (a) to try and establishcontact with the consul or vice-consul - he has agood pretext for such a visit; (b) to acquaint thelocal police with the position an instruct them tokeep very close observation bo'th on the consul andthe vice-consul, and also on those who visit theLegation. He may find tha't the Japs are intermediariesbetween the I.R.A. in Liverpool and Dublin.July 7thAtiray for the.day.July 8thMind a blank.July 9thHad a long talk wi th Lord Swinton which hadpreviously been arranged. My object was to explainto him exactly what our difficulties and limitationswere at the present moment. and to impress upon himas tactfully as possible that the imposition ofvarious tasks on this departnent by the IntelligenceCentre might be a serious hindrance to the workalready in hand, if matters put forward by the Centrevere not dealt wi th in relation to other work whichwas already going on in this office. I mentioned inparticular the 700 M.E.W. cases with which we had beenthreatened. Swinton seemed to think that this wasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186522merely a matter of getting in extra people. T pointedout to him that such people would have to getaccustomed to our files and the relative importericeof papers in them. I explained to him that it wasquite possible for somebody next to make a precis fromone of our personal files which would be e tirelyisleading. The other limitation in comection withM.E.W. material was that 5 we pulled in these peopleo do work they would all be demanding files fron analready over-burdened registry. This would mean thatfiles night be taken away from other people who mightbe doing more impo tant work. I felt that therewas very definitely a limit to the deinands that couldbe made on one set of files and that no machine,however perfect, could be expected to deal simultan-eously with all the problems at were. put to us. Wetherefore had to consider relative importance of thingand deal with the more urgent matters first. T thinhe saw my point, although he seems to have the eathat it is possible to run an office of this sort likebig business concern. T explained to him that vrehad now. under arrest more than 500 members of the.U.F. and that quite rightly it was considered anurgent matter that their documents should be gonethrough and that they should be interrogeted. Thesolution however was not an easy one. Our FascistSeetion had been ticking over quite quietly untilthe arrests were made. At this moment extra staffare needed. Unless therefore you ha.ve people inmonths before hand and keep them knocking aboutyour procedure is slowed up since you have to makethe best of your stuall nucleus of experts and anyothers who can be pulled in for urgent work. It isobviously no good sending down untrained people to interrogate ascists, or to look through their documentsThey just have the necessary ckground, ard thiscannot be couired without a considera le smoun't oftraining. The methods that we have adop'ted are toselect the more important cases and ca ry out interrogations where we are likely to get irformattion.Catalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/1865nsThe altemative is to get in a lot of inexperiencedpeople on the assumption that it is better to havesuperficial interrogation of all the people underarrest than to have none at all. It is arguablehowever that a uperficial interrogation may begr ssly misleading. While on the subject of PascisisI drew Lord Swrinton's attention to the attitude of.Nornan Birkett. Birkett seemed to think that itwas his duty to go into the whole circumstances of eaeach case in order that he can establish the man'spreasent attitude of mind and whether some Formof control should not be exercised over his move-inents. This infact is laid down in the instmuetionsto the Advisory Committee. The danger in this vas tthat Birkett was inclined to release all members ofthe B.U.F. who pleaded that they had fought fortheir courtry in the last war and that although theydid not like the present systen of government andthought that much that Hitler had done in conneetionwith the Labour Front vas sound, they were them-selves entirely patriotic. Lon Swinton thoughtthis attitude was entirely wrong and that stepsshould be taken to see that the Advisory Cormitt eedid not operate in this way. I told Lord Swintonthat Sneath was going upnto see Birkett and that ifthe interview was unsatisfactory T would let hirknow.Our whole interview was most friendly and I thinkSwinton is really out to help us all he can.We have decided to set up our own arrangementfor interrogating prisoners. This is being backedby Swinton and Crocker and Stephens are on the job.Three people have landed at Tow Head near Cork ina small boat. Two of them seid they vere Afrikanderbut vere obviously Gemans, and the other wes anIndian from Antwerg called OBED wh& said he was abird fancier. This vas difficult to believe as hisluggage consisted of two suitcases filled vrith aCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186524variety of bambs. The party also had E800. OBEDDis obviously OBED HUSEIN, the Indian who has beenworking for the Germans Cor some time. The Irishhave got there inside and ask permission tointerrogate them.July l0thFarquhar of the F.O. came down to disouss Italians.Apparently his S. of S. is in considerable di ficul-ties about the Italians who vere drowed on the"Arandora Start. Everypody is reluctant to believethat there could be any had in their pet waiters andrestaurateurs. It is tme that all of these peoplewere dowm on our list as members of the Fascio, butit had previously beer arranged that only youngmembers of the Party who, Ovring to their Localknowledge might be used against us as parachutists,should be held, while the remainder shoulai be sentback to Italy to create focal points of discontent.The waiters and restaursteurs voulld have beenexcellent material for this latter purpose. Theyhave all been earning large sums of money here andand would have resented the fact thet their businesseshad been ruined. Why this policy was never carriedout I cannot think. It seeins that both in so Par asGermans and Italians were concerned they were mushedon board indiscriminately and that no selectiveprocess was adopted.July l1thC.CARROLL, late secretary of The Link, has beenarrested ard his premises searched. A good deal ofexcitement was caused through a report that Some ofhis documents had been concealed under the floorboards. Sneath has been down to look at this butthere was nothing very exciting. The do show hov-ever that a meeting of the Anglo-Geran Brotherhoodtook Place in the first months of 1940. There isalso a certain amoun's of correspondence relating toCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186Barry DOMVILLE. The 1atteris documents have alrenaybeen examined but are not very exciting;The present German air attaoks are rather diffioultto understand. It is difficult to see why', if asmany as 100 planes come over here, they do not droptheir bombsato some purpose. It has been said thatthey are training their pilots or reconnoitering, butthis does not provide a very satisfactory explanationsince if they take the risk of coming here at 821they might as well do as much damage as possible,The only solution that I can see is that theGerman pilots are not very efficient ahd/or ratherfrightened.Three Dutchmen landed here a few days ago. Theymanaged to get away in a small boat. They reportedthat the Gemnans were massing large mubers of sma.lcraft and that we were to be attacked on the l1th.July 12thThe Cormunist policy has been discussed by theSwinton Cormnittee which has agreed to acceot ourview that for the present action against the Partyas such would be a mistake. The epresent arrangementby which employers are to be encouraged to get intouch with district orgenisers and trade unions isto continue and only in flagrant cases shall ve use18b. As regards the press, it is recomende thatthe Daily Worker should be warned under theappropriate section of D.R. and subsequently dealtwith if the paper publishes any offensive articles.At the moment it is fairly well within the law.Pilcher has had a talk with Birkett and is quiteconvinced that he will be releasing a. large numberof Aascists. He is taking the ma atter up with Swinton,who will try to get the directionsyt the AdvisoryCorrmnittee latered in such a way as to make membershipof the Party a reason for continued internment.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/186$26Dick dined last night with a friend in the Air Force,The airmen evidently have their tails well up. Hisfriend went ou'b every other night vrith 25 others tobomb various targets on the continent. He evidentlythorou hly enjoyed his work. He said morreover that ththe fighters had to take periods o:f enforced rest,but were absolutely itehing to get into the airwhenever they saw a German nlane. They re confidentthat they could deal effectively with any mass atraclohere from the air. He. said the avality of out machinewas So good that though bombers were sometimesseverely damaged they could always reach home.Unlike the Germans, our bombers of course have tolook after theinselves and are ot accompanied. byfighters.The policy of exempting from interwent certaincategories of aliens whe are employed in portantindustries is likely to cause us a great deal oftrouble. Presunably it is due to pressure in theHouse and elsewhere. Ever thing hangs on thedefinition of the word "key man". Our view isthat at the outside there can only be a score of keyenemy aliens, but already lications for exemptionare coming in for blanket makers and the like.We have written a very strong letter to the H.0., acopy of which is being sent to Swinton. We haveurged that exemption should only be granted on theanthorityoof the Under Secretary of State and afterthorough investigation, if necessary by ME.I.5.Rothsehild has gone very thoroughly into all theaspeets of this problem and has proved quite con-clusively that most of the alleged key men are notkey men at all.July July13th 13thJohn Maude tells me that the local, police in hisarea have been investigating the case of a man whokeeps bees in boxes, which he is alleged to use ascouriers. The superintendent who has been in chargeCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186of the enquiries says that the practical difficultiesof attac ing and detaching the messages would in hisopinion render the scheme urworkable.I have just heard about an officer who has leakedabout an Adniralty plan know as "sacibut and Accos-dian". A medical officer had blow into CableWireless and asked about hospital accommodationin the Azores. It looks as we had sore schemeeith for operations in North Africa or in Portugal.I have just heard of a Parliamentary Group knovm asthe Peace Aims Group. I am trying to get the namesof the menber's, but T do not imagine that it needbe taken very seriously. Greenwood seems to beworried about it.SNOW has been in co munication with the other side.They first of all wanted him to give them thename and address of a suitable individual in thenorth of England or Scotland who would be preparedto receive explosives. They subsequently cancelledthis and asked him to find out whether his friendin the "elsh Nationalist Movement would be preparedto act in this capacity. This may possibly indica tea change of plan. Some time ago we heard that thepoints for invasion were Anglesea,Scotland and theS.E. and E. coasts. The latest message to SNOWmay mean that the Gerans will go for Ireland firstand subsequently for Wales. On the other handit seems to be an indication that an attack hereis not likely to be impending. In fact the indicaticfrom S.I.S. sources are confirmati n of this view.Nothing is expected for about 10.days at least, andsome think that Spain and Portugal are the firstobjectives, with Gibraltar as the final object ofattack.I cannot belp feeling that the authorities here,bothmilitary and civil, are suffering from 5th columnCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/186Susneurosis very seve rerely. While it is of coursenecessary for us as a department to proceed on theassumption that the Germans have made carefulpreparations for sabotage ete., T am very Inuchinclined to doubt whether they have the organisationhere that our friends of the Intelligence Centreare looking for. Unlike their activitiesin other European countries, those here wereconcentrated on misleading public opinion as toGermany's real intentions. This vas done throughthe Anglo-German Fellowship, The Link, Kameradschaft,B.U.1. etc. The purpose was to make people herebelieve that Germany should be given a free handin Europe and this view was taken up by the B.T.F.in their slogan "Mind Britain's Business".the whole German machine seems to have been con-centrated on defeating us through propaganda. Asregards espionage the Germans were in a position tohave everything they warrted for the asking. Ourrearmament industry was penetrated and under oursystem of Government there was nothing to preventthe Germans from getting almost any information theyrequired. As regards, sabotage it would obviouslybe wrong to take a complacent view. It may be thatthe Gerans are holding their hands until the dayof invasion, when we may see things going up, eitherthrough the agency of the I.R.A. or possibly ofcertain elements of the B.IT.F. Up to the presenthowever practically nothing has happened in the vayof sabotage, and we know that the Gerans aremaking approaches to Snow to obtain the necessarycontacts. We also have the incident of the twoAfrikanders,so-called, and the Indian OBED arrivingin the south of Ireland with two suitcases full ofbombs. Neither incident suggests anything verythorough in the way of organisation. Just at themoment the main line seens to be byoadcasts by theN.B.B.S. and other stations. While I feel it likelythat there are a few Gernan agents here, possiblytransmittin by wireless, I do not envisage anythingCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186$7529in the nature of large bodies of individuals goingout to stab us in the back a.s soon as the Germansirvade this country.July 15thI had a discussion with Adam today about the controlof foreigners. His view is that the various foreigngovernments here which now include Poles, Norwegiansand Dutch and in a slightly different categorythe French, Czechs and Belgians, should beresponsible for their own nationals and for seeinthat they are harnessed into our national effort.If these nationals refuse to conf'arm with the wishesof their govertnent they should either be deportedor detained. There is I think much to be said forhaving a clearcut decision regarding the variousalien coramunities. en. On the other han I foreseecertain difficulties, e.g. we shall have the Polesdiscriminating against Jews and wanting the BritishGovt. to deal with them. The Czechs have alreadyasked us to return 260 members of their militaryunit.. The grounds seem to be mainly political. Theease has been put to the Swinton Committee and is tocome up for discussion. T also discussed with damthe question of exit permits. It was agreed that vedo not wish to see permits for those proceeding tothe American continent, provided that they were on a.quota. It was realised of couse that some of thesepeople might be proceeding towards Lisbon in whigcase they would have an apportunity of communicatewith the eneiny or even of returning to their ovmcountry. This is however a risk that we must take.All exit permits via the Clipper are to be referred.We are also to see all permits to Eire.Things seems to be closing in on the Bruderhof. QueeMary is now working on them. Various suggestionshave en made, one that they sho ya be transported a:as a body to Canada. This had practically beenagreed to, but negotiations finally broke dow.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/186We have now suggested to the Air Ministry that inview of the restrictions placed upon the wholecomunity and the arrest of one or to of theirmembers, it should be sufficient if the Air inistryunder the existing regulations made trenches acrosssome of their fields SO that they could nos be usedas landing grounds. Personally T doubt very much ifthere is anything in this comunity. There are ofcourse bound to be objects of suspieion in timeslike these. From reports that we have received itwould seem that their beards give rise to a good dealof trouble. If they were cleanshaven T do not thinka great many people would bother with them.JulylothAt Herschel Johnson's request lunched today wi'thKlermer of the American Embassy, who has been instruc-ted by Joe Kernedy to produce a report on: the 5thColumn. T gave him as general a picture as T couldon the situation here. I had the impression tha't heor the Ambassador was apprehensive about the desireof this country to see things through. He wan'ted toknow whether T thought there was any danger of thiscountry packing up ifte were bombed incessantly for263 months. I said that on the contrary, the morewe were bombed the more wre would dig in our toes.T asked him for his own views. He seemed to havegained a rather superificial irmpression that we had ndreally got ou heart in this war and that there vasa possibility of the country thinking it was betterto come to ters. T could have given him some arrgu-ments in suppo b of his theory, but I did not thinkit would be good for him, as they might well havepresented a false picture. In fact I did my bestto get him to believe that there would be no corprO-mise here of any sort or kind. In the meantime Iheard that one Movrer, a representative of Knoz ofthe Ministry for War or Marine in the U.S., hadinstructions to get similar infomation for hischief. Lord Swinton had instructed Brig. g.Holt-WilsonCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186530to get in touch with him and find out what he wanted.He is to be given information purely on the organisa-tion and legal side. T am a little frightened aboutthis arrangement whi.ch may become a 5th wheel in thecoach.Had a discussion today with Frost about the newsection which is to be set UD here under the guidanceof the R.S.S. It is felt that infonation From theAir Force and Navy may have a bearing on this problem.At the moment we never receive any reports of nignight bonbing activities by our owm or by the Germanforces, neither do we get any reports from navalquarters. Frost is to run this section with T.A.R.as his deputy and representative of this office. Itis suggested that there should also be an Air Force,Admiralty and S.I.S. representative.We are being pestered bythe Intelligence Centre forinforation about a woman called ROSKETLY, T havehad to turn the whole office upside dovm includingmyself to deal with this matter, which is really ofno consequence whatever. The excitenent is due solelyto the rather silly reports of Arnold-Poster, who isa friend of Hugh Dalton. The C.C. is obviously doinghis job quite thoroughly buthas got to the stagethere he is almost ready to intern the woman in orderthat he may have a quiet life. I showed this case toCrocker and asked hin to take itup with LordSwinton.July 17thThe Irish do not wish us to interview their prisonersThis is unfortunate sincewe might have got quite alot of information. I imagine the grounds are purelypolitical. T hope ultimately we may get: some informa-tion from Archer.Swinton has agreed to the appoointment of Frostas head of the Radio Security Coumittee, and willCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186532make the necessary arrangements with the B.B.C.I saw Bertram Mills' son today. He has quite a.knovledge of continental af airs and of German andFrench, and is obviously a capable person. Ve aretaking him on in 1o. I thought that should sayto him that he would find himself thoroughly at hame hhere since he was really doing no more than transferhis activities from one circus to another. I verynearly asked him if he would like me to take him roundthe stables. T would have introduced Miss Hueginsas the lady who jumps through the hoop, but sherepudiated this very strongly, saying that she wa.sthe one who cracked the whip. I am not sure thatthere isnti something in this.July 18thI had a discussion with Dics Roger ard 11. aboutTom Wintringham, who is instructor at the HultonL.D.V. school at Osterley Park. This school seemsbo be the outsome of WINTRINGHAM'S article whichappeared in Picture Post about aring the workers indefence of the country. Generall Whitehead, thelocal L.D.V. conmander has refused to have anythingto do with the school but the W.O. seem ti have givenit some very half-hearted recognition. We are takingsteps to find out exactly what goes on at OsterleyPark. There is always the possibility that WIPINGHAM might like to build up something in the natureof a future Red Ary. It all depends on the kindof peor le who are going through che school andwhether there are any politics attached to the wholescheme. There is no evidence of this at the momnen'b.Daru and Beliard called to say goodbye today. Theyare both going to the U.S. where they think theymay mn something in the nature ofy an InforationService. They think tha't through trade cirreles theymay get to know quite a lot of what is going on inFrance.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186533France.A .PICCARDA, a French lawyer who had called on S.B.was sent down here to see me. He has been doingpropaganda work for us in France and for the Frenchin England and has been in close touch with all thevarious rench Missions. He was very worried abou'tthe mentality of some of these people and thoush'tthat they sho 1d not be alloved to go back. Therewere various under-currents of feeling. The mostsinister was that which had produced a jealousdesire to drag us down with the French nation.They do not like the idea that they had been defeatedand that we vere still ab bay ard vere rather inclinedto say that it would be much better that the presentstru le should come to and end and that a new overshould be created. Piccanda said he thought it wasa mistake to send back some members of the missionsand to retain others. He thought it would be farbetter to keep them all here and to get the PrimeMinister to write them a letter stating the reasons.He drafted such a letter and also left me a noteof his views. T discussed this subsequently vrithLord Swinton when he called in the evening. Heagreed with uS that it vas no good trying to beck-pedal the whole machine at this late stage. A]] theservice debts. had vetted the missions and writh afew exce tions had decided tha't it vras no goodtrying to bolt the stable door after the horsehad gone. All the inforation of importancehad already gone across to France.Snow has had an interesting message. It is proposedto drop somebody in Irelend or this country.Infomation is reouested asto doewenis ard formal-ities required for getting to this country fromIreland. I am suggesting that a man should bedropped in Ireland and should be given instructionsas to how to obtain a visa from Passport Control,These instructions should be of a kind wh ch vil.lmake his identity apparent. Ve can then pick himCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186$34up when he lands. It is very important that he shouldnot Ball into the hands of the military or the pazamshots ei4hey here or in Ireland until we have got hiswhole story and instructions.Swinton called this evening. T raised with him thequestion of the release of Gerans from internment.He is quite prepared to support us within the framevrorlof the H.O. list of exerptions. He entirely agreedthat it would be disastrous if the scheme for consid-ering the eases of really important people engaged innational york degenerated into anything like wholesalerelease of all those employed in any industry.E dined with V.V. and Jasper, when ve discussed thequestion of S.I.S. dealing direct on certain masterswith authorities in this country. They are nowrecruiting agents here of a1l nationalities and it istherefore important that they should have facilitiesfor carrying on their work. They are also engagedin operations here in the event of a German laring.V.V. has very cheering news about the effect of ourbombing in Germany. It sees also that the Germansare very scared about coming over here. Not only dothey dislike our fighters, but also our A.A. andcoastal batteries.Gooch has returned from Liverpool. He has arrangedwith the Liverpool police for a close watch to bekept on BEPPU; who is expected back from Treland inthe course of the next few days. Gooch managed toget into the consul's office and to make arrangementsfor finding out the combination of the safe. As soonas this has been done, Gooch will go up and have alook at the contents.July 19thOur old friend SIMON, who was arrested here beforethe war and given 6 months for ontravention of theCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186535Aliens Order, has turned up in Eire under the name ofANDERSON. He was obviously up to his old gamesand has been given a sentence of 3 years.The J.I.C. have published a memo on future policy.Active preparations are to be made to prepare theground for offensive operations on the continent assoon as there is any break in the morele of the enemyor any sig of disturbance in the countries underoccupation. In the event of the Germans moving southward, occupation of the Azores, Cabe Verde Islandrand the Canaries is contemolated. The Gemnansseem to be concentrating on our shipping, and heavyand somewtha't costly attacks are being made on convoys.It seems however that steps are being taken to meetthis situation. The destroyer situation in the HomeFleet is soewhat critical. There are only about 65destroyersat the moment and 10 on stocles which willbe completed within the next few months. At the endof the last war our total destroyer strength was 4433.July 20thThe P.P.U. seems to be gettin E rather active, andthe remarks of some of its members would constitutean infringement of D.R. The membership is somethingover 100,000. It is not thought desirable to talce anaction unless things get much worse.Cecil has got an interesting link-up on UTAID.Afirm here called Raw Furs which is reported tohave I.R.A. connestionsz is associated with anotherfir called Thora America with Gernan comnecti.ons.Thora in turn is onckltile] seier a firm Grondhal ofStockholm, who paid money to UNLLAD.The Eire authorities appear to be arresting a certainnumber of Germans.July 2lstSpent the day with Charles.John Maude came overCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186530He is very worried about the lists which are beingcompiled by the soldiers of people they intend toarrest in the event of ar invasion. He thinkes i:thopeless to try and withdraw these lists as he feelsquite sure that the soldiers yrill keep a copy andact on it. He suggests that we should,in conjunc-tion with the C.C. compile lists of people concerningwhose reliability there is some sort of doubt, andarrange for them to be arested by the civil power inthe event of an invasion. We could then shaw thesoldiers this list and their minds would-be at rest.At the moment one of the corps has a. scheme forsending out a code word "collar", and probably othercorps comnanders have similar schemes. Nobodyhowever seems to know when this scheme should beput into operation. For example, if the Germansland at Harwich, is "collar" to operate in Bedford-shire? If we make arrangements for lists to becompiled by ourselves and the police, it wi.ll benecessary to give the police hee powers additionalto those which they already possess.July 22ndAttended Swinton Comnittee when we discussed therelease of exempted ca egories of enemy aliens. Thereare 17 such categories and if things are not verycarefully watched there wi.ll be something in thenature of a wholesale release. He arew particularattention to the definition of "key man". LordSwinton and also Mr.Wall,wh T understand is a T.U.man who has been put on the Committee to balanceit up from the Labour angle, were both very emmphaticabout the smal? nunber of really key men thatexisted. Mr. Yall thought tha't in 9 cases out of10, the enery alien could very easily be replaced.Theo turner pointed out tha't it vas illogicel.to exempt all holders of the ATys. permit. Some500 hed been given this permit; but very few of thencould be regarded as key men. The H.0. were anxiousCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186to maintain this exempted category and Lord Swrintongave way. T mentioned to the conittee the caseof Soag Nac ine Tools, there representations had beemade by General Spears on behalf of the GemanSchoenthal. Soags have now been taken over by theMinistry of Supply who are of opinion that Schoensthal's services are by no means indispensible.Gen. Spears had said that the fectory would have toclose dowm without Schoenthal, I also mentionedthat the same arguments applied to the fir ofLoewy; about which Lord Beaverbrook was soconcerned. He had said that if ve interned theGerans in the factory he would move the wholefactory into the internment camp. It has nowbeen ascertained that at least 7 firs could do thework of Loewys.After this meeting T vent on to another at theCabinet fices, where Sir Edvard Bridges wastrying to collect infomnation about the ArandoraStar from the various..dep'ts concerned. Thereis no doubt that the military camps have madea first class muddle of the whole business, althoughE expect the general measure for interrment tookthem very much on the hop. They had their campsall ready at the beginning of thewar, but were notallowed to use them. Now they suddenly get anorder to intern between 30 and 40 thousand, anddeport as many as possible to the Dominions.Huyton Camp at Liverpool is I believe in ast te of real confusion. It was from this campthat the people embarked on the Arandora Star.Even now there is no authentic list showingexactly who were on board. We agreed that 8l1 Cat.AA. enemy aliens and prisoners of war should besent firs't of all. Beyond this we had no say inthe matter. No lists were submitted to us eitherbefore the boat sail or afterands.Jnly 23 23rdAn intercepted wireless coaunication in oipherCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186538between New York and Germany shows that Germanagent in New York has been instrueted to ascertainfrom British seamen the effect of ferman borbingin the U.K. This is certainly encouraging if it canbe taken as an indication that thisis the mostrapid means of communicating the facts from thiscountry to Germany.Yet another comithee has been set up. It iscalled Makins Committee and is for the purpose ofsorting out the Various foreign goverrments in thiscountry and the extent to which they are to havejurisdiction over their own nationals. It iscertainly high time that something was done, sinceall sorts of questions are arising for which thereis no reaay-nade solution.I lunched with Herschel Johnson. He had not agreat deal to say but T rather sensed a-backgroundof slight gloom. This seems to be rather prevalentamong members of the American Embassy and T believethroughout the junior ranks of the di Lomatic cors.July 24thHad a long discussion with Theo Turner about ourgeneral policy with regard to eneiny aliens. Thewhole situation is rather hopeless. The officewas imnobilised For the firs't 6 months of the warby considering and reconsidering these cases.After a tremendous effort we sueceeded in gettingsome general measure of interment. Now it isproposed to let a great many out and to ask u1S oncemore to review such cases on thei.r merits.Personally I feel it is all a waste of time. Asusual we try to be too kind. If we had internedeverybody at the beginning of the war and sortedthem out properly into the various categories whichcould be employed collectively under some sort ofcontrol, it would have been far kinder in the longrun. Now they are all rushed i to interent underCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186539conditions which carrot be too good. The worstfeature from our point of view s that it clogs thewheels of thisaffice and diverts the enercies ofthe staff into fruitless channels.July 25thLord Swinton came down and we had to hours conversation. The first point disciissed was ways and meansfor dealing with the cases of enemy aliens who werepu't up for release. Lord Swinton thoughtthe reputation of this office would stand or fallon the way our cases were put 1mp to the Master ofthe Rolls. He eriticised, I think rather unjustly,some of the cases that had been put up from thisoffice, ard he and Crocker recommended that weshould employ 6 solicitors to deal with the problemin future. E said that Mite frankly I could seeno useful purpose in the H.O. submitting cases ofCat.C aliens to this dept. unless we hed soine veryspecial interest. This vas doubt since had wehad suf ficient information to get the Ont.c alieninterned under Ro yal Prerogative ve should havedone so already. Mathewrs was got over from the H.O.and it was finally decided th we should only havereferred to us cases where the H.O. file showedthat the Security Service had an interest.The next item on the agenda was the proposal that weshould get a chief inspector from N.S.Y. and5 or 6 sergeants and inspectors who would act asexpert investigators. T said that D thoughta small nuber of trained detectiveeinspectorswould be useful to supplement the work of otherofficers. I did not think however that therewould be mnanycases which they conld nvestigatethroughout the country entirely on their own.William Charles mentioned the Manchester Letter asa type of case which could well have been handledby a police officer. I agreed that there werecertain aspects of the case that could have beenCatalogue RefERENCE:KVI4/18Ecleared up by a detective inspector, but that thereal clue to the document was in the head of one ofour experts on the Fascist movement. One of ourmain difficulties was not to offend the variouspolice fordes with whom we were in contact. Ifhowever this could be overcome we should welcomethe services of 2 or 3 inspectors or sergearts.We had tried to get some attached to us throughS.B. at the beginning of the war but the Commissionehad put his foot down.The final point for discussion was the preparationof cases to go through our interrogation centre.Crocker thought we should have half-a-dozen solici-tors to prepare these cases for the interrogators.T said that T could not envisage that there wouldbe work for more than two or three since there wouldhave to be a lot of discussion and coaching by ourexperts in the Fascist Moveent if we were going toget anything out of the interrogations. LordSwinton said that he thought it would be better tohave. and that if whey were not wanted they couldbe used for other work.July 26thI got Crocker to come down and see us in themorning as I felt very worried about the variousproposals of the previous day. I got in 11. ardDick and Curry, as I wanted Crocker to hear FromM. the probable effect on S.B. of the establishmenthere of a squad of C.I.D. officers. 2. exlainedthat the appointment of a C.I.D. officer to theS.I.C. had already created the most unfavourableatmosphere. This appointment had been deeplyresented by Canning who with Gill and Foster hadterdered his resignation. They took the view thatif they were given extra staff thyey could quitevell have sent a suitable officer, and that theyknew far more ab ut that particular kind of workthan the C.I.D. M. had on a previous occasionCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18654ldiscussed with Gamning the ousibilities of buildingup a small enquiry foree here and Caning had beenquite agreeable to the proposa although he did notfeel that he could lend us any of his officers. Hecould rot spare his best ones and did not vant tosend us his duds. H. thouu he that we migh't get coundthe question if he and Crocker had lunch withCaning and asked him for suggestions. He didapproach Camning later in the day, but vas unsuocessful in getting him to Lunch. Caming said thatKendal did not like Crocker, and that if itbecame known that he had been lunching with him tierwould probably be a good deal of trouble. He thoughthatwe were going to have great ifficulty gettinany assistance from S.Y. since the Counissioner hadmade it very clear that he would not part vi.th anyof his officers. We now seem to be about wherewe started. Personally I feel we might do worsethan try and ge't 2 or 3 suitable people Crom theBirningheam police.July 27thThe machine tool control have t ken over 9 machinetool finns under D.R.55(4) and appointed a boardof management. They are now considering ways andmeansof keeping these firms clean of enemy agentsand safeguarding their activities as far as possibleagainst any f'rm of leakage. This is I think areal triumph for Rothschild, who has done avery good job of work.A group 1 message has been intercepted betweenIreland and Germany and refers to a man calledDONAGHUE, presumably a German agent, who is comingover here in the course of the next few days.A new branch has been formed in the ffice calledthe O.Branch, which is to deal with organisation.It should have a lotAo do.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186542July 28thWe spent a hectic morning trying to sort out thecase of Lady GLADSTONE. She wanted a permit toenter a protected area in order to stay with theMinister for Air. The police said that she wasassociated with Cornunists,whicl was not strictlytrue, although she has drifted on to most Left Wingcommittees at one time or another. She is reallyan ardent member of the League of Nations U ion.This brought her on to the Conmitteel gainst War andFascism and also caused her to join various Peaceconmittees and to chammpion Haile Selassie.The Minister for Air is indigant because the casewas held up for several days owing to the policereport, which we had already over-ruled.The question of repatriation of Japs in the eventof war with Japan is being considered. There isan idea that it should be done on a generalexchange basis. Evidently the possibility of arupture is envisaged. We have today asked theJapanese Govt. to declare their attitude.The mechanisation of our registry is still causinga good deal of confusion and it is not expectedto be running smoothly for at least two months.We have imposed a travelling censorship which seemsto be quite e fective. They have produced one caseof suspected sabotage and one of sabotage in theHull area. I expect they will peter out on investgation. We may I think make use of this service forenquiries by our N.branch in certain suspectedareas.S.C.0. Ramsgate reports an air raid on 12th July.No damage was done except to a lacal pig who wasrendered temporarily insane. It later recovered.There is another story from Brighton.

It was at'tached to a landmine, which completely demolished the hole of thegreen.July 28thThere have been at least two cases of doctors whohave been taking bribes from internees in orderthat the latter may be provided with a medi.calcertificate either to prevent their interrmentor to obtain their release. One of them was chargingE5 and putting them into nursing homes.An S.I.S. report states that the Germans arecontemplating some action against Russia in theBaltic.The Germans have started a new wireless broadcast frowhat is known as the Workers Challenge Station.It is preaching COuununism. The question of janmingthis station and others has been considered. Themechanics of such an operation are not easy and onbalance the view is accpted tha't these broadeastscut very little ice and can be gnored. There isno reason to think that many people listen to them.It would in fact be difficult for the ordinary setto pick thein up.Abbott of the Post Office has got a scheme forcentralising all suspicious calls which are broughtto the notice of G.P.O. He thinks that if oneindividuals is found to be common to a nuber ofthese calls from different parts of the country itmay possibly indicate that he is acting in some mayas a collecting centre for infornation.On July 24th a man called STOFFEL telephoned to a.Miss ANDRE, New York, urging her to get into touchwith GRENEN of the American Federation of Labour andurge on him the necessity for making peace.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/186544This conversation may of course only have takenplace with the knowledge of the German Govt. andis perhaps in somne degree a pointer.July 29thThe Japs have arrested a number of our tradersin Japan, on grounds of espionage. I am told thatin fact there is no basis whatever for theaccusations made. It seeins that the Japanesepolice and military are being pressed by thevery strong German colony in Tokio to barrass usa.s far as possible in the Far East.There is an interesting case of one Hans LIE,Portuguese of German origin. This man seems tohave fored a company here and to be doing verylittle business. The company originallyreceived most of its finance from Germany. It isostensibly trading with Lisbon in cork.July 30thWe have been trying to get hold of Arthur SCHULTZfor the interrogation centre. John Phipps wastold that he wa.s at the Oratory, and shortlyafterwards another individual rang he up frcmP.W.2 to say that he was on board the "Ettericlc"en route for Canada. In actual fact there seemto be two people of the same name, but I think wehave the right one at the Oratory.We have prepared at the request of the F.O. a listof about a dozen names of suspected Japanese spieshere and also a list of prominent traders. TheF.O. are contemplating action.The question of Italian dual nationals has beenunder discussion. It looks as if these peopleCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186suswould have to come before the tribunal before longand it is important that very clear directivesshould be given to the Chaiman, otherwise theywill all be let out. We feel tha't it should beaccepted that members of the Fascio should remainin internment and that we shoul.d not be calledupon to produce proof to show whether they joinedvoluntarily or under coercion.The present policy of the censorship is underreview. The question arises whe'ther we wantO cover both Eire and America 100jo. The costwould be about half a million. We have said thatwe place Eire first, Spain and Portugal secondand America hird. We have also been aslred tostate the value we attach to the intercepts sentto us. This is always a rather difficult matter.It is possible to point to one or two specificinstances but in the main benefits may not beapparent until some future date.July 3stThere has been a meeting on seamen which va.sattended by Theo Turner. It was held to disousscertain grievances. In view of the impo tarceto the national effort of these people he hadbeen decided to relax restrictions.

It has however been deeided not toprosecute Maule RAMSEY at any rate for the presentOriginally a conspiracy charge had been contempla-ted.Peters and Philby called on mne today about atraining centre which they vish to establish herefor special agents who were being sent abroad.They were very kceen to keep the organisation assecret as possible and wanted to discuss ways andmeans of doing this. I had had a previous dis-cussion with them, and the plan which they haveworked out seems a good one with a few exceptions.One of these was a suggestion that all theira.gents should have their finger prints taken atScotland Yard. I to them that they could notDo sibly do this without stating the purpose andt is might lead to endless complications.There is a omplaint that we are not submittingsufficient reports to the Centre. The fact isthat the Centre is a completely illogical bodysuperimposed on existing organisations which arealready co-operating very closely. It isobviously in M.I.5 where information received bythe Centre should be co-ordinated. At present itis a case of the mountain going to Mahomet.August lstSpecial material on July 29th shows that MaiskiCatalogue Reference:KVI4/186suyas telling the Egyptians that negotations fora secret alliance between Russia.,Turkey,Bulgariaand Yugo-Slavia were going on despite the visitsof the Bulgarians to Germany and their consulta-tions with Italy. Maiski seemed confident thatthese negotiations would be successful. It isdoubtful however whether much importance can beatta.ched to Maiski's views as I always had theimpression that he wa.s rather in the dark.On July 26th one MITTELHAUS of Berlin asked ANDERof New York for infomation from English paperand English news to be wired back to Gerany.This seems to be yet another indication of thedifficulty that the Germans are having in obtaining information from this country.I spent the morning at home in order to get somework done.A special Registry has been establi.shed at South-port of those registered since 29.9.39 Itincludes landing and insigration cards and allother particulars known to the Registrar General.This special Registry will also includeparticulars of any persons registered. prior to29.9.39 who are considered by the RegistrarGeneral, the police or oursellves to be of veryparticular interrest.

OBED had in hispossession a letter addressed to one S.B. KATIN, anIndian in Liverpool. This man was arrested by theLiverpool police and is being sent dovmn to theInterrogation Centre. e hope to have some otherIndians to keep him company.On the 26th July Transocean,Berlin, asked Santiago,Chile, to obtain from their correspondents in Englandnews about the prevailing mood in this country.Presunably Chile would have to receive this by letteror by secret code since they could not say very muchby cable. They would not be receiving it by somewireless or else communication would be direet fromhere to Berlin. This is a further pointer to thefact that the Germans are having considerable diffi-culty in getting inforation from this country. Itmay also indicate that wireless bransmission from heris not being extensively employed.-Sir Richard ACTAND has started a moveinen't for theextension of the L.D.V. to a Citizens Away. He iscirculating pamphlets asking people to infoon himwhether they have offered their services to theIL.D.V. and had them turned dovmn. ACLAND is a Liberalcrank, but his movement may become rather brouble-some. We are pointing the fact out to the D.hI.so that the W.O may make up their minds whether theythink it advisable to bring ACLAND into the fold oralternatively try to curtail his activities.T.A.R. has picked up another German code message Fromthe Air Arm, Hamburg.

Onoy 20 came forvrard.The remaining 40 were taken at random, and all 60were released. This haraly seels credible but theH.0. are making enuuiries.H.O. have been sending over? a lot of their filesfor our observations, regerding the release ofGermans in whom we have had no prior interest.Thisis quite contrary to the arrangement. I havetaken the matter up with Drinlwater.Roger has put up a memo advocarting that cormunisesshould not be allowed to remain in key positionseither in Go t. deparsinents or in industry. Heis going to submit the proposal to Leggett beforewe put it forward to the H.0. T thinle the momen't hascome when they will have to put their cards on thetable. It is quite obvious when a man is removedthat he is removed on account of his political viewsand I think we may as well say so in suitable foranamely that as he owes allegiance to a foreigGoverrment, he is not a suitable person to be ina position of trust Where confidential informationis available.August 3rdJasper told me today that he had had a stormyinterview with Swinton, who had complained tha'twe were not carrying out his nstructions (a) regardappointment of solicitors (b) regarding Policeinvestigation and (c) that in general Our whol.einvestigation branch was extremely inadequate. Hetherefore proposed that William Charles should comein and put things right, with the rane of. DeputyDireetor. Crocker has been down and picked on oneor two things which might obviously have beerbetter done had we had a. thoroughly efficient staff.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186550The point that we have expanded Crom 16-100 ina very short time and we have had to tackcle 211 thearrests within the last few weeks, i.e. B. ..,Italians and Germans, that vre have had to actendinto the regions where ve have appointed most of ourbest officers. Here we now ory have about half.adozen old hands trying co contro] between 90 and 100others. On top of all this the registry has beenmechanised and more or less paclced up. My on viewis that apart from certain adjustments there is noreal solution to the problem until we get anothercadre of officers trained. Only time can help us.It may be that solicitors are better qualifiedin some ways, but my experience is that wether youtake solicitors, lawyers, barristers or bishopsyou have to get the experience of this office andits political bac ground before your man is goingto be much use. This place is not a mixture ofHarrods, Scotland Yard and Philips Opperheim, whichis the rather helf-baked view which Crocker andSwinton have got. Unfortunately Crocker jumped.to all sorts of conclusions and punped all thisinto Swinton before really getting the hangof the work. It is perhaps a good thing in somewaye that he is coming in as he may relaise some't ingof our difficulties. I only hope that he wi.ll goa bit slow otherwise he may break up the machinecompletely. It is quite easy to get higher authoritto impose this or that on some department, butyou can only work these decisions by kindness andit is generally better to approach the problem inthat way and only invoke higher authority in reallybad and serious cases of obstruction. There isanother point, namely that of taking on still moreofficers. It is a solution, butit can only be avery radual one since we cannot supervise cheactivities of those we have got already, neither canthe registry satisfy their requirements. Theprevalent view outside this office is that it ispursuing spies in the saie way as the O.I.D. pursueCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186561criminals. In fact only about one-ifth of thework of the office is in this direction. It may bethat we should do more but it is equally importantto have a clear view of all the various organisationin this country which may be of a defeatist kind.Philip Allan, the Private Secretary to JohnAnderson, rang up today about three Durtch cases,one of a man called FRANCOIS, another van BURENand the third SCHIPPE. The Dutch have beencomplaining about these cases concerning whichwe had been in consu tation with various represen-tatives of the Dutch Police. It has now beendecided that van Tsant of the queen's Policeshould be responsible in all these cases and thatPhilip Allan wanted to know his views. I got Woodto telephone to him. He ascertai ed tha't Van Isanthad been following FRANCOIS himself for about 3vreeks and waS thoroughly dissatisfied with hisbehaviour. He was also highly suspicious of VanBUREN, but in this he was up against 3 of his owministers. He has arranged to see both ERANCOISand Van BUREN at 10.30 on Monday; whe he will letus have his final views. He did not Inov anyt ingabout the case of SCHIPPE, but suggested that Ruys,the former Dutch Consul at Antverp, might be able tohelp. This information was passed on to JohnAnderson who seemed satisfied.We have arrested iwo more Indians eomeoted yrith AHKAHN. They are also being brought to the Enterroga-tion Centre.August ithD:M.I. rang UO to ask whether woul.d see SomersetMaugham, who is being sent to America by che Ministrof Information to enlighten the Aoricans on the 5thColwm. This led to a discussion between myselfand D.MI.I. on 5th colun activities here. HeCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1865$2entirely concurs in our view that the Nazi Partywas the basis of these activities and that itsliquidation to some extent at any rate had reducedthe danger from individuals. He believed that atleast 90 of 5th column activity here was thecreation of neurosis. He thought there might bejust a handful of soies but probably not moreif as many. He also thought that there might be afew people, such as members of the B.U.F. I.R.A.ete. who would cut a few wires in times of emergencySpent the afternoon with Cha'rles.Aupust 5thThe SCHUTZ case has been thoroughly gone into a't cheInterrogation Centre by Crocker. He has come quitedefinitely to the conclusion tha't the man isinnocent. He has complied with our request to decodecertain portions of his letters, and this has beendone to our satisfaotion. TThe code is merely onebetween himself and a married women, and is quiteimocuous.On the 2nd Anigust one BERITARD at Lisbon was asked byDr. MEISNER of the Propaganda Dept. in Berlin to getEnglish papers. particularly provincial ones, whichwould be compared with those obtained from London.The plan was evidently to make use of inforationnot published in London for propaganda purposes.It was particularly desired to get nevrs of theinternal situation and feeling in England. Infona-tion was also requested from Dublin. The reply wasthat this was impossible, except via Hew Yoric.

I asked him how it was thathe had come on to the Centre. He said that vresthrough Herbert and possibly through Joe Ball.Ball had at any rate given him to understand ththat it was through his influence that he vrasthere. He had been told that it vas an organisa-tion with executive power which vras going toco-ordinate intelligence. I said that many peoplehad burnt their fingers trying to co-ordinateintelligence, and that the whole business vas a massof intrigue, political and othervise, wi'th everybodygunning for eryoody else. I tried to explain tohim that this office was rather different to othersand that a oisiderable amount of time andexperience was necessary to get the hang of it.Itwould never have ths lick ef ficiency of HarrodsStores or Seotland Yard, but there were certainaspects of it vihere considerable use could be made.of two or three trained police fficers. Ithought the first thing to do was to get theRegistry into thorough working order.August 7thLond Swintor has decided that we should agree tothe admission of Italian duals, members of theFascio, to the Pioneer Corps,provided they wereprepared to renounce their oath of allegiance toMussolini. As Curry points out, there are manyaspects of this question which have not beenstudied and may render it workable. The wholeposition is extremely complex. 'There are some 700duals interned. Those who refuse to join thePioneer Corps could ld presrmably exercise theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/186554right of appeal to the Advisory Conmittee, whichmight let them out. They might then be called URin their age group and be re-intered for refusingto serve. There are already over 100 duals who arenot members of the Hascio who have refused to -serve. Their disposal has no been decidedon.Another coumlication is that we are bound toaavise the military authorities that if membersof the Pascio are enlisted, they will have to bein a separate unit, and uder much stricter controlThey cannot mix with Itelians 17ho are not maemnhersof the Fascio and they canou be allowed to wanderabout in rotected areas.

He wa.s ratherdistressed about what he described as an atmosphereof hostilities and non-co-operation. He has theimyression that nobody wants to play. I told himthat the main trouble was that nobody knew what hisposition was in this office. There had only beena verbal conuunication and no specification ofduties beyond the vague Dhrase "investigation".In the meantime it wa.s only natural that people s1should not be very responsive, particularly sincethey felt that the office had been unjustlycriticised. Everybody knew tha't there weredeficiencies but these were very largely dueeither to unforeseen circustances or to lackof government policy. It seemed hard thereforethat people who had been doing a lot of good worthere should be made the scapegoats. I explainedto him again that while T thought there wa.S worlhere of the detective kind I did not think it vas Ququite on the scale which he imnagined. T saidthat this office was not like Scotland Yard, withfast cars dashing about. Croeler then showed hethe nate from Swinton appointing him a deputyDirector and stating that he is to be in chargeof investigation. He is to retain his seat onthe S.I.C. I said that as far as I knew Harkerhad never received anything in writing. Croekerwas worried because he did not think Frost intendedto give him any sort of control of his organisa-tion. I said that I thought Frost would want toDut out enquiries to him in the same way thatvarious officers of B.Branch would do.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/186
