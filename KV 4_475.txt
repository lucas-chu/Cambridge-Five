The magnificent fan-vault roof, built betiveen 1508 and 1515, owes its supreme beauty equally to thegenius of its designer, the master mason John Wastell, and to the traditional skill and craftsmanship passedon from earlier generations, In like manner the scholars of the University, jealously guarding the learning ofthe past, have by experiment and research continually advanced to new knowledge.Founded over fifty years ago by one of the leading instrument makers of the Cavendish Laboratory, PyeLimited are proud that their home is in Cambridge: Traditionally high standards of engineering and crafts-manship, allied to the most enterprising scientific research - these qualities, in laboratory and workshop,have built the world-wide renown of products bearing the name of Pye.RADIO AND TVManufacturers of Scientific InstrumentsRadio and Television ReceiversBlind Landing EquipmentElectronic and Vacuumn ApparatusTelevision Transmission EquipmentSpectrophotometersPye Limited Cambridge, EnglandPrumted And Puhllshn by THE TIua PUILEATENO CuNANY.

January 1. 19521953.1st January.While there seems to have been a rise in prices of about 6%,certain things have been easier to obtain and in some cases have beencheaper. I cannot speak about my suit this year, as I have not had one,but there should be some reduction in the price in view of the reduetiolof Purchase Tax. I have no doubt, however, that the tailors have founda way of keeping the price up:It is still difficult to see how as a country we are going to getout of our financial embarrassments without a serious reduction in ourliving Standards. Already the rearmament programme has had to beslloved down. Winston, in a broadcast on his discussions with Eisenhower,has used the slogan: "Not aid, but Trade", implying that we can only payin goods, and then only if the American tariff walls are pulled down.While this would be of considerablle assistance, it is doubtful whetherit would be a complete solution to the problem. The present Governmentseem to be determined to cash in on our lead in aircraft desigh, and itlooks as if at least some of our resources will be switched from cars toaircraft. Already regulations permit the purchase of more new motorcars on the home markeb - second-hand cars are at a discount.Communis here does not seem to have made much progress Themembership now stands at about 35,500, but while the Press allways seemsto be in difficullties, it invariably sueceeds in just keeping its headabove water, doubtless due to donations by some wellwisher. The TradeUnions are taking an increasingly strong line,an in one or two caseshave banned Communists as office bearers. We callculate that there areroughly 504 Party members holding some sort of official position withinthe Unions. The Front organisations go on, and while it is difficultto estimate exactly what effect they have on the popullation as a whole,we are inclined to think that the majority are a bit bored with suchorganisations as the Peace Council.In espionage ve have had a few minor successes, notably theMARSHALL case, involving KUZNETSOV, an employee of the Soviet Embassy.It is the first, I think, since the war where having established thatKUZNETSOV was a man ready to receive information, we sueceeded in tracinghis contact, MARSHALL, through a successful Watching operation. KUZNETSOVwas not too clever and there is every indication that the technique in thefuture will be made more watertight. Forst of all the agent makes achalkmarkatsomepre-arrangedpoint,indicatingthathewantstomakecontact. This is answered by a car with a certain number being parkedat a particullar point at a certain time, and followed by a pre-arrangedrendezyous. Such meetings are as rare as they can possibly be made,and in the interim messages and money are passed by being left at apre-arranged spot in the open and picked up subsequently by the agentwithout any meeting actually taking place. There has beenatendencyduring the last year for Soviet officials to meet and dine with Servicepersonnel and, in some instances, to join Clubs. This has been noticednot only here but in Canada, and possibly elsevhere. It may signifythat Soviet officials abroad have been reprimanded for not producing moreinformation,or that there ds a dearth of information in general. Sovietofficialls may well have said that they cannot hope to get informationunless they are given greater freedom in making contact with Dationallsof the country in which they reside. It does not follow, however, that2.this is the only means by which information 1is collected, and it maywe1l be that espionage on the old lines, through the establlishmentof some Company dealing in East/lest tradeal forms a basis forthe collection of information. We know, for example, that theCommunist Party in Italy if financed by this means, through a surplusbalance, and we think it possible that similar operations may be goingon through a Company known as WEX in this country, but such proof aswe have is onlly negative.In Europe the Commnist situation is perhaps less acute. InFrance the expulsion of MARTY and TILLON has caused a considerableunheaval. While there is no evidence yet of a very marked split, theFrench Government still seems to have difficulty in putting hts financialhouse in order and getting ita citizens to pay their taxes. Whenevera really cruciall issue arises on this point the Government seems to fall.The Gaullists, too, see to be divided in their views and at last itlooks as if they were going to enter the Government arena in a coalition.Ont oe the major difficulties in France, hovever, during thepast year has been the situation in Indo-China. While the Frenchare holding their own rather precariously, there seeins littleprospect of their being able to clear up the situation and make agracelul retirement unless they are going to fall down on theircommitments in Western Europe. The question is largely one offinance, and instead of reducing their standards of living and forcingtheir own nationals to pay, their tendency iB to try and squeeze somemore money out of the Americans. If they could hand over to theVietnamese without any serious loss of face, I think they would doso.Meanwhile, the Americans are giving them considerable logistic supportin Indo-China. Neither they nor we, however, are anxious tp put inany personnel in case this might lead to direct Chinese intervention,as in the case of Korea.The other danger spot in Europe is perhaps Italy, although Tthink it may be said that the position is slightly more stable thanit was.In the Middle East we have gone through a period of seriousdisturbances in the Canal Zone. It waa hoped that the abdicationof the King and the advent to power of Neguib might lead to anequitable settlement, but latterly the position has deterioratedand negotiations in the Sudan have reached rather a criticall stage,when the Egyptians seem to maintain their attitude that before seriousdiscussions can take place about the Middle East defence organisation,British troops must be evacuated from the Canal Zone. While it mighthave been poBBible to do a deall with Neguib, he is clearly surroundedby tolent Egyptian nationalists who force him front time to time to makeprovocative statements.We should, think, be prepared to move if we could getsatisfactory guarantees about the maintenance of a base in Egyptin the event of hostilities, Which would invave leaving behind anumber of troops on a care and maintenance basis. Meanwhile, itwould not suprise anybody if the Ilchwan wer to precipitate mattersby a renewed outbreak in the Oanal Zone. They have already shownsigns of eliminating any personnel known to be giving assistance tothe British in the collection of inforation.In Persia the situation has reached an impasse, There seems tobenoprospectofhavinganyGovernmentthereexceptanultra-nationalistor Communist one. Meanwhile, the Americans are getting worried lest theprecarious state of Persian finances may lead to the advent of the3.Tudeh Party and the incorporation of Persia as another Soviet satellite.This leads them to put forward suggestions, and even to operate behindour backs, with the result that Mossadea still thinks that he can playone Party off against the other.The Americans do not seemto appreciate the fact that the dollarloans will not be used by the present regime to improve the lot of thepopulation; the money will merely stick to the fingers of the rulingclasses. A large amount of the money that the Anglo-Iranian havepaid to the Persian Government in the past has suffered a similar fate.Another thing Which the Americans seem to fail to appreciate is thatweakness in Persia merely sets up a general reaction in other statesinthe Middle East who have control of oil supplies this has alreadyhappened to some exxtent in Irag, and it may well happen to the Americansthemselves in Arabia.In Malaya there seems to be a distinct improvement in thesituation, largely due to the energy, and the strength of characterof Gerald Templer. There is no doubt that he has put heart intothe officials and the population, as a result of which the number ofoutrages has considerably decreased and evidence is forthcoming thatthe M.C.P. has been forced to change its taotics. The countryis,however, far from being out of the wood, and there is still a greatdeal to be done. Jack Morton, as co-ordinator of Intelligence, seemstobeworkingwellandtherehavebeencomplimentaryremarksaboutIan Carrel, who is seconded to the Police. Leighton, too, our S.L.0.,has done a very good job.In Korea the stalemate still prevails, probably until Eisenhowermakes his position clear. It seems likely that the Chinese steppedup the fighting about the time of the Primaries in the United States,in the hope that Korea woulld be made a definite issue in the Americanelections, and that one side or other would commit itself. The Koreanvar was already unpppular and there is evidence to show that the Chineseoffensive operations were merely designed to cause casualties. Fromthis it may be assumed that the Russians and the Chinese, or certainlythe Russians, think that a continuation of hostilities for the timebeing was more to their advantage than an Armistice, even though thelatter would get them the right to build aerodromes in North Korea.The Chinese have a force of over 500 MIGs and the North Koreans, 75.In addition a certain number of twin-engined Jet light bombers ofRussian design have made their appearance. This build up in trainingis steadily going on; if, therefore, there is an Armistice, and the Northernforces have: the right to construot acrodromes, they willl be able tore-open hostilities with a good deal of tactical air support. Thiswholle position is now being reviewed. Meanwhile, Eisenhower has madeno pronouncerent, but presumably he will have discussed the matter withWinston, who is at present in the United States.The Indian proposals,whic were on the Whole reasonable, wereturned down by the Russians in the United Nations in such a way as tomake it fairly cllear that, for the time being at any rate, the Russiansfelt that a continuation of hostilities was in their best interests.InSo doing they have clearly lost a certain amount of face with their ownsupporters, but this has been largely counter-balanced by the stupidapproach of the correspondent of the New York Times to Joe Stalin, askinghim the same old questions. Joe has, of course, expressed his anxietyfor peace, and his readiness to discuss matters with the Americans andourselves.If he gets no response he will be able to say that he has made4.a gesture which has been rejected.There is still no solution of the Kashmir problem and bothsides complain that we do not give them support. Pakistan is infac't considering a withdrawal from the Commonwealth.I have read Hill's legal opinion in the case of Alan ErnestOSBORNE, who vas interviewed by Simkins a few days ago and undercaution made something in the nature of a confession of espionagein 1941. The case arose on account of a review of the case ofOliver GREEN, who, while in prison for forging petrol coupons,hconfessed that he was a Soviet agent. A search was institutedat the time, and as a result a document was found giving particularsin OSBORNE'E handwriting of somebody called "J.K.N.", subsequentlyidentified as John Kennard NESBIT. The implication was that NESBITwas a suitablle person to be approached. Both OBBORNE and NESBITwere serving in the same Regiment.Hi1l does not think that OSBORNE'S confession could possiblyeven constitute a prima facie case against him, particularly after alapse of nearly 11 years. Certainly no case could be mounted withoutinvolving GREEN, to whoin an undertaking was given that his case Shouldreceive no publicity and that no prosecution would result from anythinghe had said. Be have decided, therefore, not to put the case up tothe D. of P.P.THIS is A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958Fel 2ot0Stourton came to see me. He is taking over as No. 2 in thePolice Division of the Colonial Office from Abbiss. I told him thatthe only weakness in his organisation seemed to me to be a lack ofaccessdirect to higher authority. He said that it had been well rubbed intohim when he was offered the job that his job would only be advisory.I said it seemed to me that that made it all the more necessary thehis advice should go in at the top and not at the bottom. He entirelyagreed, but it is of course for Muller to put this over.I asked him about Nigeria, and in particular about Kirby-Green.He said that it was of course difficult for Kirby-Green to follow on topof "Tin-Eye" (Stephens), who had on the whole been a success. This5.surprised me a little, since I have had such dowing accounts ofKirby-GreenfromD.0.S.HetoldmethatKirby--Greerhadblottedhis copybook rather badly shortly after his arrival, by advocatinganL.I.C.andintimatingtotheGovernorthatthisCommitteewouldhave the authority to make recommendations which the Governor wouldsee carried out. The Governor, quite naturally, did not appreciatethe views of a nevcomer who was telling him that he was going to berun by a committee. He apparently reaoted very strongly. Stourtonsaid that he saw him the same day and that he was bsolutely furious.Kirby-Green subsequently told Stourton all about it.The thing eventually blew over and Ithink relations are now fairly good.Highett, on the other hand, seems to be a great success with thePolice. Stourton did not know how he got on with the Governor, butehad heard no complaints. His wife, too, is very thuch liked andseems to fit in well with the wives of Police officers, who are notalways easy!2nd January.A tellecheck shovs that a man called MCGRATH, acting on behalf ofthe Argentine Ambassador, is tryiing to claim the services of NUNN MAYfor the Argentine atomic project. MoGRATH. is by way of persuadingNUNN MAY to go with him to Ireland to-morrow, and has booked passagesby Aer Lingus for himself and NUNN MAY, and for one other whose namewill not be disclosed until the last minute.le notified the Home Office and Dick and I went over to a meetingcalled by the Home Secretary. The situation was alll the more serious,since the P.M. is just about to arrive in the United States. If he weregreeted by Press reports that NUNN MAY had left the country for Ireland,he would clearly start Off on a bad wicket. Various proposals wereput foward about enlisting the assistance of Higgs, a Conservative M.P.who is a solicitor acting for NUNN MAY, and also making statements to thePress. The Foreig Office, although seriouslly concerned, had nosuggestions to offer. Finally it was agreed that the best plan wouldbe for us to go down and see NUNN HAY immediately in order to ascertainhis state of mind and his reaction.to MeGRATH'S proposals, if in fact thehad been made.I confessed to a certain amount of schaden-freude when Ruck,of the Immigration Service, admitted to the unfortunate position broughtabout by the withdrawal of any control of Irish traffic. The factis,of course, that such limited effectiveness as there might be in with-drawing a man's passport has nov been completely removed, since he couldalways go out to Eire without papers. In spite of this, however, weare trying to pass legislation: to control the exit of British suspects,and in addition proposals are being made to reopen the system of weekendexcursions to the Continent.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOOUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT JNDER SE( ER SECTION3(4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958Few20106.3rd January.Dick and I saw the Home Secretary again to report progressabout NUNN MAY, who had been seen by both Dick an Skardon lastnight.After some difficulty they had succeeded in getting into thehouse. The opposition vas due to the general persecution by thePress, who had camped themselves in Chalfont St. Giles. In the endDick and Skardon had a meal with HUNN MAY, his brother and sister-in-lawa rather tough Yorkshire woman. It transpired that only a quarter ofan hour earlier NUNN MAY had received a letter from MCGRATH suggestingthat he should go away with him on the following day for a holiday inIreland. There was mention of the Argentine project. NUNN MAY saidthat he had no intention of going, and they left with a completeunderstanding that he would make no move without informing and takingadvice from ourselves. He intended to see the Ministry of Labourthe following week about getting employment. Dick was completelysatisfied as to NUNN MAY's bona fides in this matter.Later on, however, the NUNN MAY's had received a calll fromMCGRATH, who had stayed for some two hours. He was pleasant andpersuasive but made no heaaway. We learned later fromn Binghamthat, having failed about the Argentine, he had decide3 to turn theinterview to good account by publishing a story to the effect tha'tNUNN MAY had booked passages to Eire but had finally got cold feetbecause, it was alleged, he believed that certain people were outto do him in. This Btory had been offered to the Sunday Empire NewsThe Home Secretary was pleased with the results of our effortsand sO also, he told us, was the Foreign Secretary, to whom he spokeon the telephone.We thought that it might be a good thing for the P.R.O. at theHome Office to speak to the Sunday Empire News and explain to themthat MCGRATH was a fraud, in spite of the fact that we knew that injournallistic circles he was regarded as unreliable. Largely onNewsam's advice, the Home Secretary decided to leave things as theywere. In the event the Empire News did not publish; had they done so,however, the story would inevitably have broken in the United Statesmuch to Winston's annoyance.5th January.Burt came to see me at my request. I showed him a letter whichhad been drafted to the Commissioner:a) about using the Scotland Yard wireless carsfor tracing the whereabouts of Soviet diplomats, andb) about notifiying us immediately if any Soviet orSatellite diplomats got into the hands of thePolice.There had been a case of one of the Russian cipher clerks having beenfound arunk, minus his wallet and a certain amount of his clothing,of which he had been relieved by a woman. Had ie been able to see himwe might have been able to guide the episode into more profitablechannels.7.Burt entirely agreed with our proposals and undertook to givethem his backing. He thought, however, that dt would be a good thingif I saw the Commissioner personally and explained our reasons in greate)detail.Drew came over to tell me about Operation MINCEMEAT. TheForeign Office had had a telegram from Madrid stating that Ian COLVIN,a free-lance journalist,had been probing the MINCEMEAT story, which is mentionedinRommel's Diaries shortly to be published. He had seen a formerAbwehr officer called LENZ or LEISSNER, who had confirmed the incident,and he had already got on to the part played by Sir Bernard Spilsbury.Drew and Reilly had considered this telegram and replied toMadrid that they should be told that he had been scooped by the DailyExpress and that a much more authentic version of the story was shortlybeing published.Meanwhile, Montagu, who had received a further approach fromthe Evening Standard in November, was urged to accept the offer onthe grounds that it would be better that he should publish a controlledversion, which woulld avoid such awkwardnesses as the handing over ofthe body to us by Bentley-Purchase, the Coroner.I said that while I agreed we were presented with a fait accompli,the impression created by Montagu pubiishing the story under his ownname would be extremely bad among the many officers in our Service whohad loyally abided by their undertaking to keep their mouths shut.Would it not, therefore, be possible for Montagu and Cholmondeley tocollaborate and for the story to come out under Cholmondeley'e name,or under some pseudonym? Drew said that he would consider this.Montagu is hoping to make 82,500 on the deal, but mightgraciously slip 2500 to Charles Cholmondeley. Drew wanted to knowwhat we thought about Cholmondeley. Hill and I thought it was entirelya matter for him to decide. Technically both he and Montagu were stillin Government service. I made it clear, however, that if I were facedwith a similar situation, nothing would induce me to accept a penny.At the Appointments Board to-day D.E./A reported that a letterhad been received fro S.L.0. Salisbury asling for nominations for thepost of Defence Secretary to the Governor of Nyasaland. D.O.S.agreedthat he would see the Governor and get more particulars of the latestdate by which the appointment should be made.I mentioned that there had been an allocation of CoronationMedals to the Service and that selection had to be made of therecipients. It was agreed that D.E/A would circulate a note aslngfor suggestion and would also epitomise the principles of giving theMedal in SO far as they would assist selection.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINED(4) DEPARTMENT OF THE PUBLIC ER SECTION RECORDSACT 19588.Overseas Postings.This COPYThe following were agreed:RETAINED SECTIONACT 1958.

It was further agreedto recommend that Colonel STEPHENS be appointed in chargeof the Port & Travel Control Group vice Brigadier HINCHLEY-COOKE on retirement of the latter, and that he should beasked to extend his S.I.M.E. tour until the autumn in orderto be able to take over in sufficient time.3)Major STONE to be posted to Washington vice Mr. PATTERSONat the end of the year.4)D.0.S. would invite Mr. U'REN to open the projected stationat Aden, and to go to Aden either for one tour of two yearsor for a special period of one year.

I gave him certain additional details and emphasisedthe importance of the problem from our point of view.He said that he would give the matter his most carefulconsideration, and that if it were possible for wireless cars to helpin any way he would make the necessary arrangements. He was,however, worried about the leakage of information angle. He pointedout that the list of cars in possession of wireless patrols referredalmost entirely to cans that were missing, and the normal action,therefore, was to report them in order that they might be returned to9.their owners and enquiries instituted. In our case, of course,the action would be different, and it would no't be long, therefore,before wireless patrols knew precisely what they were doing.I said that we had considered the implications of this and,while it woul be most regrettable if anything of the kind happened,it was a risk E thought we should have to accept. We should,however, like to give further consideration to the point after hehad examined the problem and before any measures were actually putinto force.As regards the second question, Scott did not think that thiswould present any serious difficulty, provided the man was not heldunduly after he had proved his identity.I went to mee't the D.G. on his return. He told me that hehad a private audience with the Pope, for over an hour, and that heand his family had been decorated. I gave him the gist of theNUNN MAY case.6th January.Hill told me that he was having trouble over INTERAVIA, whokeep on publishing confidential information about our aircraftconstruction. INTERAVIA is run from Switzerland by a Jew calledHEINEMANN, and the suggestion had been put forward that he shouldbe given copies of our D. Notices. Hill thought it was wrong togive these to a foreigner, and I agreed. Meanwhile, there isa suggestion that either HEINEMANN, or his representat here,should be seen by Admiral Thomson and persuaded from furtherpublication, which has already brought us into bad odour with theAmericans. The mericansrepresentative of INTERAVIA has apparentlyagteed to submit any data that he may obtain.Hi1l tells me that he has attended a meeting with ForeignOffice and other legal advisers on a suggestion that Kenneth de COURCYshould be presecuted for trying to solicit infommation from Hadow,our Consull in Los Angeles. De COURCY had suggested that thisinformation should be given off the record, or if Hadow liked, onthe record. Hadow had replied, rather stupidly, Baying that while hewould be only too glad to help, he had no knowledge of the baclgroundsurrounding the departure of BURGESS and MAOLEAN.The meeting had agreed that in all the circumstances there wasno chance of. a succeesfull prosecution. Hadow Woulld be told to writea letter to De COURCY, correcting his previous one,and Consuls Wouldbe circulated asking them to notify the Foreign Office before replyingshould any approaches be made by De COURCY.THIS is A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958 Few 201o10.The impression on the Americans of this kind of thing is,Of course, lamentable.7th January.We had an Appointments Board to-day, when we saw fourcandidates.8th January.At the J.I.C. to-day Drew ma'de a statement about the MINCEMEATcase, but made no reference to omY suggestion that Montagu should notpublishunder his own name. I raised this point and said how much wedeprecated the whole incident, which was a shocking example of someonein the Intelligence know who was making money out of a publication ofa good story which. he had acquired in the course of his officialbusiness. This would be bound to arouse considerable irritationamong many of those- who had abided by their undertaking when theyleft the Service. The Committee was thoroughly sympathetic and askedDrew and me to explore the point.At the Appointments Board to-day D.E/A reported that an interimreply had been received fran East Africa aboutthesuggested Kikuyu transllator, and that the D.G. had given authority toproceed with her recruitment. It was agreed that she should notbe admitted to the 6th Floor.D.E./A reported that the D.G. had approvedathe postings recommendeby the Board Meeting of the 5th January.THISE A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958Feb 201011.After considering the question of MINCEMEAT again, I agreedwith Hill and Hollis that if Montagu was going to publish the storyin detail and a copy of his version, according to Drew, was alreadywith the Daily Express, it would be obvious to everyone who theauthor was under whatever name the publication was made. I thereforetelephoned to Reilly and to Drew, saying that, ,lamentable as the wholeincident was, I did not think that there vias anything more we coulddo. T mentioned, however, various points in the story which struckme as being in singularly bad taste, particularly certain remarksattributed to Winston, which I am quite sure he would not like.H1L tells me that Jowett has approached the D. of P.P. forall papers connected with spy trials. He is writing his memoirsand wah'ts to include details. The D. of P.P. has refused to givethe papers, but does not think he has heard the last of it.Hollis tells me that the interpreter, one PILLEY, whose realname ishas a brother who is a close friend ofBob STEWART. Unfortunately this did not emerge at the time thatPILLEY'E name was passed over the records. As PILLEY was recommendedby the Foreign Office, for whom he has done a considerable amountof interpreting, he may be all right, but his brother certainly is not.Enquiries are being made.Dick is not too pleased, as PILLEY sat in on his lecture on thework of B. Division given to the Tripartite delegates.9th January.James Robertson,a David Stewart came to see me about thecaseof an Amerdcan citizen known aswho is a free-lancejournalist working to "Time' and'Life". He has arrived here froSwitzerland and was in fact in Switzerland at the time when the moneycame through to MACLEAN'E wife. The Americane have positiveinformation from BRIDE thatwas a spy in 1944 or 1945.Wepropose to use all technical facilities and to sep him underobservationI saw Newaam about thecase. He talked to me a gooddeal about the publicity that M.I.5 was getting. He thought itextremely undesirable and expressed his intention of doing anythinghe could to damp it down. He had no concrete proposals to offerhowever.OOPYORIGINAL DOOUMENTOF IC RECORDSACT 1958Ee?o1012.loth January.Holllis tells me that there is a move on foot to open no-passportexcursions in the sumer. It seems to me very remarkable that theForeign Office shoulld be talking to the Americans about refusing apassport to Alan NUNN MAY, who, incidentally, has not got one, while hecan perfectly well go out through Eire without any papers and, if theseexcursions are going to be run, his exit to the Continent would not bedetected either. Meanwhile, they are talling about a Bill to preventthe exit of suspects, although how they propose to detect them if theyare carrying no papers has not SO far been explained.12th January.Cumming and Kearn came to talk to me about Chinese defectors. TheWar Office are worried about deserters from the Chinese Army being turnedback in Canton and wish to get this put right, pending proposals by theDizon Committe to encourage any overt propaganda to cause Chinese defectionThere is already a certain amount af covert propaganda. If the ForeignOffice proposals are to be adopted, we shall probably get a large numberof dubious Chinamen who will be hoping to get a wad of money and a peanutstore in Singapore. Nobody has considered yet who is going to pay for thisJohn Marriott and Miss Bagot came to see me about a number of documentsrelating to Communist activities in Egypt, obtained on a cover addressused byhas recently visited Egypt. He posted the documents fromParis as he did not wish to have ther taken off him on arrival at the port.I agreed to alllow photostats of these documents to be sent tD the MiddleEast.13th January.The D.G. is seeing the Home Secretary, as Eden wishes to raise thecase of NUNN MAY again in the Cabinet.

James Robertson is going to see Ross and get full particulars.We have allso heard of a Roummanian defector in Switzerland calledwho has been attending some health conference there. He hasdefected to the Swiss; the Roumanians have asked for him to be handed over,but the Swiss aresending him over here.James Robertson tells me that the Watchers have made a mess of theThey were challenged by the Security Officer atClaridges and told thatknew that he vas the subject of attention.1s nov saying that his room has been searched, which is not true.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION(4) OF THE PUBLIC BECORDSACT 1958Fe2otoHill is sending his comments on Montagu's draft story to Drew, andwill make it clear that we will accept no responsibihhity for the course ofaction that is being taken.I attended the L.S.I.B (Senior) meeting this afternoon.14th January.At the J.I.C. this morning the papers regarding Chinese defeetorsanddeserters were discussed. IT was decided to deal only with thequestion of preventing the authorities in Hong Kong from turning backdeserters. The War Office had asked for this action pending soerecommendations, not specifieid, by the Overseas Committee to Ministerson a more progressive policy for the encouragement Of Chinese defectors anddeserters in generall.The other questions are to be put back to the Working Party on Defectorswhich I have urged should be summoned as early as possible.Meanwhile, a telegram is being ent to Hong Kong aslcing the Governorto consider allowing Army deserters to enter the Colony if they can satisfythe authorities as to their bona fides. The basisoftheWarOfficecomplain14.that such deserters have been turned back in the past, is not known andI have asked specifically that figures should be supplied. We may wellfind that there have been only two deserters inthe last six months.I have made it clear that if by any chance the Governor agrees tothe admission of deserters but refuses to allow them to settle themselvesin the Colony, we have no authority at present to disburse funds forresettlement. J.I.C./52/28 of 16.4.52 - Instructions for the futurehandling of Soviet and Satellite Defectors - specifically excludes Chinese;1t would, therefore, be necessary firs't to define a Chinese defector andtodecide whether a deserter, high or lov level, is to come within thatdefinition. Secondly, where defectors are to be resettled (in thisconnection Geralld Templer has defined the limited category which hewould be prepared to accept in Malaya) and thirdly, the fund fra whichthe resettlement expenses are to be paid.On this last point we have no authority to use the grant that we havealready been given for the settlement of Soviet and Satellite defectorshere. We could, of course, use this fund for Chinese defectors as well,disbursing such amounts as are required by H/SIFE, but we should have toenter a caveat to the Treasury that additional sus might be required.As to the general proposals foreshadowed by the Overseas Committee,we should I think agree with J.I.C. (F.E.) (52) 29 (Final) of 10.10.52,subject to our amendments being accepted.If the wider proposals of the Overseas Committee come up, we mightwell draw attention to the dangers of general encouragement to Chineseby overt propaganda. If the Chinese are led to believe that by comingover they will get a few hundred pounds and facilities for opening apeanut store, the whole business is likely to become a raeket. We mightmention, too, that as the primary object of the operation is to getinformation, it would perhaps be better tp push on with the proposals fora Bhinese Interrogation Centre in Hong Kong, which at presen't seem to behanging fire.I discussed with Hollis and with Dick the question of the futureHead of SIME. It seemed to me there were only four candidates - FurnivalJones, John Marriott, James Robertson and Graham Mitchell.F.J would do the job well, but it seemed desirable that he shouldfirst have B. Division exp perience, and that B. Division would profitfrom his Knowledge of C. Division. He would be well suited for the headof B.1. I doubted whether either Graham Mitchell or James Robertson wereideall for the job of H/SIME, bu't it seemed to me that John Marriot Woulddo it admirably. It would be good for him and good for SIME. I amafraid, however, that for family reasons it will be a bit of a wrench, butI doubt if we can help this.I have written to Drew setting out my views on MINCEMEAT. I toldhim that we had always been opposed to the publication of stories of thiskind for the following reasons:-a) It is never a help to any Intelligence organisatiion to let apotential enemy know its methods, or allow him to think that these15.methods have been applied successfully.The more he is left in thedark the better.bIf one person is allowed to publish such a story with impunity, andindeed to make money out of it, it becomes increasingly difficult to preventothers from doing the same thing with or without permission.c)If "sources" are involved they may be jeopardised and will feel thatthe authorities are either not to be trusted or incapable of giving themprotection.I have explained that as our sources are not involved we cannotcomment officially on Montagu's story, the more So since he was an officerof N.I.D. at the time.and shoulld, therefore, according to the Lord President'ruling given on lst August, 1946, get clearance by his own Department or theBoard of Admiralty. I undergtood that this had already been done.Such comments as we could give, therefore, on Montagu's draft were offthe record; ve were merely trying to make the best of a bad job.Meanwhile a note from Drew has come in giving the extract from Rommel'diary, showing the action taken on receipt of the MINCEMEAT information.In editing this diary, Cyril Falls has said that MINCEMEAT was a plant bythe British designed to cover the invasion of Italy and mentions the connectibetween the story and Duff Cooper's bool 'bperation Hearltbreak"15th January.Barton rang up to read me the telegram he was sending to Hong Kongabout deserters. He is asking for facts and figures and is suggesting thatmeanwhile they shoulld be given entry.Hinl told me that Admiral Thomson had had a successful interview withHEIMANN, a German refugee Jew, who controls INTERAVIA. HEIMANN has agreedto the appointments of a representative of INTERAVIA here who is satisfactoryto us, and to the submission of any information that he collects forcensorship by the Air Ministr before it goes to Switzerland.In returnHEIMANN wants the S.B.A.0. to withdraw their ban on adyertisements ofBritish aircraft in INTERAVIA'S publications.

Some similar suggestion had come from the inistryof Works.We are refusing to have anything to do with this, since the properchannell is S.B., who have the full responsibility.16.We are circulating to the J.I.C. quite an interesting memorandumon the behaviour of Russian diplomats in making contacts, both withof ficials and outside parties.I mentioned to Dick and James Robertson that we might usefullytry and ascertain whether any of the new Dominions have had approacheseither here or in their own countries.At the Appointments Board to-day D.E./A reported that the number offiles from the Registry in action with sections on 7th January, 1953, was7,850. It appeared that a number of files could be released if sectionswould not await repllies before returning the files. It was agreed thata circular should be issued and that Directors should be given the figuresof files in their Divisions.D.E./A. reported that he had received a suggestion from theMinistry of Works to the effect that Eastcote should be earmarked forour use in event of emergency. It was agreed that the Ministry of Worksshould be informed that we did not consider this a suitable place eitherfrc the point of view of the nature of the building or its proximity toLondon. This was done and the Ministry reply was that they were notsurprised. T stated that I would raise the question of our wartimelocation at the J.I.C. and asked that P.A./D.G. should advise me of thepresent position from the J.I.C. papers.D.E./A reported that the D.G. had not yet arrived at a decisionas to whether or not Mr. SERPEIL should be posted to the Far East andasked that the Directors should consider alternatives. There was somediscussion on this but no conclusion vas reached.The Board agreed that Mr. R.A. HENLEY should be posted to S.I.F.E.and that the projected posting of Mr. ELLIOTT should be abandoned - (seeminutes of 8th January). The date on which Mr. HENLEY is to proceed willbe fixed later as it is affected by other moves.The Board agreed thatshould be posted toB.1.A. on joining the office on 2nd March.D.O.S. reported that MR. U'REN had asked not to be posted to Aden,andthis was agreed. The Aden vacaney would be further considered.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINED16th January.IDEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIO RECORDSA telegram has cane in fra S.I.M.E. about clerkwho has given away plans for Operations RODEO and FLAIL to an officialof the Egyptian Police in Ismailia. He was apparently detected by theDOR.A.F Police. He is now being interrogated by the D.S.O. Meanwhile,all have been warned that these two plans, which are concerned with theprotection of British lives and property in Alexandria and Cairo, havebeen compromised.The clerk's name is R.O. ASTON, of whom we appear to have no trace.If he was in possession of these Top Secret reports in the ordinary courseof his duties, he should have been vetted. If not, there has clearly beena serious lack of security at Air Force H.Q.17.Haldane Porter came to tell me that the Home Office had receivedan enquiry from the Department of Justice in Eire y asking particularsabout one TOLSTOY, who has a farm in Southern Ireland and a boardingouee in Dublin.TOLSTOY has a rather bad record of colllaboration with the Russiansat the time of the occupation of Hungary. In 1950 or 1951 he moved toBrussels and subsequently to Eire.Much speculation is going on about: the recent arrests of doctorsin Moscow, who are accused of being responsible for the deaths ofZHDANOV and other Soviet leaders including several Generals. Itissignificantly mentioned in the Moscow communique that five of thesedootors are Jews and their names are linked with the Jewish ReliefOrganisation, known as "Jointn (?).It seems fairly clear that the triall of SLANSKY and other Jewsin Czecho-Slovaldia, who ware said to be working for the Zionists andthe Imperialist Powers, was a curtain raiser for the trialls that arenow being staged in Moscow. It is, however, difficult to see at themoment the exact reason for the prosecution of the doctors. Somesuggest that it may be an attempt to curry favour with the Arab world,others that it foreshadows some link up with Nazi groups in Germany.In this conne ection, the British authorities, with the connivance ofthe German Government, have just arrested five leading Nazis allegedto have been plotting against the Bonn Government. There is a furtherpossibility that the Moscow trials may develop into accusations againstBERIA, and that some of the doctors may plead that they were acting oninstructions from the M.G.B.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION17th January.3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958 Feb 2.010To-day we learned of the arrest of DOTTINGER, the German Ministerfor Foreign Affairs in Eastern Germany. This move had been expected forsome time and seems to be the end of any form of coallition. It correspondsto the NAGY period in Hungary and the MASARYK period in Czecho-Slovakia.The Government in Eastern Germany will probably throw off any pretenceof representing the more moderate elements and become wholly Oommunistin structure and policy. It probably means, too, that Russia has givenup any idea of stopping the rearmament of Western Germany or theunification of East and West on her own terms.The other sensation in to-day's paper is Neguib's coup d'etat.He has abolished all political parites and confiscated funds. He hasalso arrested a nuber of Army officers. There is to be a transitiondictatorship for three years. If reports are right, that Neguib isreally anxious to effeet a satisfaotory settlement with the West, this may18.be a good move. depends to a large degree on how firmly he isprepared with his Junta and in particullar with the Ikhwan.19th January,I had lunch with "George" Jenkin. He told me a certain amount abouthis experiences in Malaya, and there is little doubt I think that had hesurvived he would have been able to do a very usefull job under GeraldTempler w in fact Gerald has adopted most of his ideas. His maindifficulties were with Gray and with Gurney. He liked Gray personally,but did not think he had the right experience for running a Police Force.He thought that Gerald Templer would ultimately make a success of the jobif he could solve the problem of getting co-operation fra the bulk ofthe Chinese. This meant, above all, getting the Chinese to join thePolice and to work loyally for them. It might be that the success whichGerald was having in the bandit field would encourage Chinese ce-operationgenerally, but this would undoubtedly take a considerable time.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOOUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958 Feo 2010At the D.G's meeting we considered the question of Serpell'appointment to S.0.0. I.F.E. Various alternatives were consideeedand further enquiries are to be made of the Australians as to whetherthey really have anything to offer Arthur Martin. The fact is thatto some extent we are reaching a point of stagnation in regard toappointments overseas. There are many people who have served already,are no't physically fit, or cannot go for family reasons.20th January.I gave my usual. talk to the Police course at present going on.Dick asked me whether T minded if an approach were made toMontagu in the matter of Jewish reactions to the arrests in Moscow.I said that if he hoped to get anything out of Montagu, who is I thinkSecretary to the Anglo-Jewish Association, he shoulld certainly gO ahead.My grievance against Montagu, for the publication of the MINCEMEAT story,should not stand in his way.I had a long talk withwho is now in S.I.S. 9 about themechanisation of Post Report records. I explained to him exactly what wewere doing on the security side and made it clear that the codbfication ofsome 200,000 reports would be a colossal task and one on which we coulld not19.justify expenditure, seeing that our security needs were allreadymet.It transpired thatfirst task was to select some 1,500from the Post Report category in order to build his Pioneer Corps. Isaid that I wondered whether he could justify mechanisation on that alone;it would, for example, be open to him to apply to a Chief Constable fora list of people in his area between certain ages, and he could then, ifnecessary, interrogate them, a task which he would have to perform in anycase before making a final selection. He is going to think this over.Meanwhile, I have promised to let him know whether the Aliens Branch haveany nationality cuts, and how the Police file their reports.21st January.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958 Felo 00I saw Reilly after the meeting and asked him to let me have a replyto my letter about our using Police wireless cars for reporting on certainRussian cars which we new to be employed by Embassy intelligence personnel.Isaid that if any difficulties were raised, he might say that if a leakagedid occur it coulld fairly easily be expllained as part of the regulationsfor ensuring that Soviet personnel did not go outside the 25-mile limit without permission.I tallked to Cumming and Kearn about Chinese defectors.There is tobe a meeting of the Working Party next week. The first necessity is todefine a Chinese defector and to decide Whether deserters are to beincluded. We shall then have to consider the question of finance.Meanwhile, there appear to be several new defectors in the offing whomay ultimately eat up a considerable portion of our fund. None of themseems to be particularl exciting, but they might prove useful. Theymaybe the first fruits of the anti-Zionist moves which have been taking placein Czecho-Slovakia and Russia.20.22nd January.Whittick rang up to say that Colville of the P.M'S officehad approached him in regard to the search which was being conductedin the Cabinet Office for microphones. In fact, Hollis and Claytonhad been over to see them. The search is due to apprehension on thepart of the P.M. that a similar technique as has been applied against theBritish and American Embassies in Moscow might be applied to certainoffices here. Evidently Colville wanted to be quite sure that Hollisand Clayton were all right.At the Appointment Board to-day the following matters werediscussed:This IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION8 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958.Feb 20lo2.Deputy Head of S.I.F.E.It was agreed that Mr. Morton Evans should be approached witha view to accepting the position of Deputy Head of S. S.I.F.E., and failinghim, Mr. Martin should be offered the appointment.3.It was agreed that D.E./A. should proceed with negotiations forsending Mrs. Towndrov for temporary duty of six months to S.I.F.E.L.The end of April was fixed as the date for posting Mr. Henleyto S.I.F.E., subject to Mrs. Towndrow accepting a posting to Singapore.If she did not accept, the matter woulld be reviewed.5.D stated that on further consideration I did no't feel that we shouldask for representation an the Imperial Defence College course beginningin January next. This was agreed.6.The Board agreed that at their next meeting a decision should bereached on the officer to be posted to Aden, and the appointment of anofficer to succeed H/S.I.M.E. H/s.21.23rd January.Mann came to see me. He said that he had been asked questionsby various Chief Constables about the significance of the arrests inPrague and Moscow. Was there anything that he could do?I told him that the position was at present somewhat obscure.On the other hand, it seeea clear that a number of Jews had been arrestedand accused of being associated with Zionist activities which were supportedby the Americans. It seemed to me a little doubtful whether the arrestsdenoted/anti-semitic policy. They were more likely to be due to ageneral tightening up of security in the present state of world tension.Zionism, like Roman Catholicism, to some extent constituted a State withina State and had, therefore, in Russian eyes to be eliminated. The effect,however, on Jewish members of Communist Parties might be considerable, sincethey would always have the feeling that they were under suspicion. Therehad already been reactions of this kind within the Communist Party here, butit was early yet to say what the final effect would be.I said tha't this interested me, because there had been someiscussion here about dividing our Service up into Home and Overseas.Personally I had always been against this because people who are leftoverseas too long develop separatist tendencies and become highly criticalof Head Office, whose work they cease to understand. The raison d'etrefor having abroad is, to a large extent. to carry the principles andexperiences of Head Office to a Colony, and to adapt our methods to localconitions. It was also our purpose to keep a Colony aware of the widerimplications of subversive movements which might at any time have animpact on local movements,an obtain fro the Colony all availableinformation which would assist in building up the wider picture ofinternational subversive movements.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958 Feb Doo26th January.I have had two talks withof M.I.6, who was anxious to knowwhat progress had been made regarding the proposal for mechanising Pos'tReport.I toldthat as far as the security side of the question wasconcerned, we vere satisfied that the present procedure was giving us allwe wanted. In the general interest, however, we had explored the whole22.position, since it seemed a pity that the inforation of interest toother Departments contained in these reports should not be in a form whichwould make it readily available. For a variety of reasons, which Iexplained to him, it did not seem to us that we should satisfy thevarious needs which had been put forward by other Departments without anenormous amount of work and probably, in many cases, without going backto the alien for further particulars. If, however, M.I.6 for their ownpurposes felt that there was some advantage in codifying the existingreports, and ey had the manpower to do it, there was a complete set ofreports in the Home Office to which they could have access.said that he would like to consider this before the projectwas finally abandoned. I have given him access to all the data in bursfile.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SEOTION27th January.(4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958Feb 2010Burt came to see me to-day. He told me that he had recently madean approach to Morgan Phillips, from whom he hoped to get certain detailswhich would assist him in hi.s arrangements for the protection of Tito.Morgan Phillips has apparently met Tito on several occasions.Morgan Phillips had subsequently sent Burt a note which he hadreceived from Arthur Bax, Secretary of the Labour Party Press andPublicity Department. Bur't is lunching with Morgan Phillips again nextweelc. He thought the liaison, Which had the approval of Ronnie Howe,might be a useful one.I to 1d Burt that some little time ago the T.U.C. had expressed adesire to have some contact with ourselves in an unoffieial way. We hadmade it cllear that while ve were always ready to receive information, itwould be quite impossible for us to enter into any kind of exchange Whichmight facillitate the task of the T.U.C. in getting rid of their Communists.In this we had received the full backing of Sir Robert Gould, who agreedthat it would be most unwise to enter into any exchange of the kind, sinceT.U. leaders could not be trusted where their own interests were concernedand they would be almost certain to .misuse any information that was givento them, with possibly disastrous results.Burt said that he had no intention of giving Morgan Phillips anyinformation and that his attitude in this respect was in line with our own.He would, however, continue the liaison and let us have any information ofinterest if it came his way.Hinl talked to me about various cases of leakage which he is handling.One had arisen through a Foreign Office telegram to the Argentine onmeat transactions, which had been used to wrap up some article handed into the Gas, Light and Coke Company for repaire. Norman Brook had takenthis matter up in a big way and had written to all recipients of thetelegram asking them to account for its present whereabouts.It seemed to me and to Hill that the answer must lie in thearrangements which the Foreign Office make for the destruction of theirconfidential waste.23,28th January.Dick and Malcollm came to see me about the line I was to take at-morrow's J.I.0. on D.S.I's proposal for the Higher Scientific Committeewhich would deal with the application of science to the procurement ofintelligence.Lennox called to-day. He knows Norman Edwards, Managing Directorof "Answers" which comes under the Amalgamted Press (Camrose). Eawardswife was formerly Nina Batchelor, employed in an outside capacity duringthe war in the control of double agents under TAR.Edwards consullted Lennox in regard to the possibility of gettingAlan NUNN MAY to write a series of articles for "Answers" under an assumedname. These articles would be in simple language and deal with thepossibilities of applying atomic energy to industry. Edwards' approach toNUNN MAY woulld be through the latter's brother, whom he has met as a fellowmember of the Savile Club. He has in fact discussed the matter with thebrother, who has in turn discussed it with Alan NUNN MAY. Alan NUNN MAYseems agreeable and is meeting Edwards this week.Lennox has tentatively told Edwards that he can see no obviousobjection, provided some competent person in the Ministry of Supply approvesthe articles, but. he undertook to try and obtain advice. Meanwhile, hehas asked Edwards to let him know from time to time about Alan NUNN MAY&Sgeneral state of mind.Incidentally, Lennox disclosed that he had been asked by Drew to letknow about any individual who might contemplate going to Soviet Russia atany time in the future. presumably so that Drew could use the man for thepurposes of deception. Lennox had evidently thought NUNN MAY was apossible starter.I think I have made it fairly clear to Lennox that as far as NUNN MAYis concerned he would be wasting his time, and that any attempts to misleadthe latter on the progress of atomic energy would be useless andalmostcertainly harmful.I attended D.F.P's cocktail party, where champagne only was drunk!I met Mc Grath, D.F.P. representative in the Middle East, who seemed tobe a sensiblle person. I also had a talk with Charles Cholmondeley. Hetold me that I should be receiving a letter shortly from his solicitor.malcing it clear that he had refused to benefit in any way from the publicatiof Operation MINCEMEAT. T said that I was very glad to hear this and thatI was absolutely sure that he was right. I had frankly-bee ratherdisgusted by the whole business. I asked him how far he thought thatD.F.P. could operate with any value in peacetime. He said that while ofcourse the problem was extremely difficull't,-the more so since it was neverpossible, as it was during the war, to know the effect of operations - heaid think that in the present state of tension in Russia no Soviettelligence organisation could afford to ignore any piece of information,however improbable, it might appear. Russian subordinates would be far tocafraid not to put information forward to higher authority; it wouldther fore get into the files and might to some extent confuse the issue.2L.Drew told me that he had succeedes in extracting 306 of Montagu':earnings from the Daily Express as Crown copyright, and that this summight amount to as much as 51,000. From this I assume that Montagumust be getting nearly E3,000 for his story.At the J.I.C. to-day a paper by D.S.I. and '6: on the formation ofa higher committee for the development of scientific aids to the collectionof Intelligence was debated with a certain amount of heat for an hour anda half. The Chairman strongly upported our cllaim for membership of thecommittee, but for some time D.S.I. stubbornly maintained that his planhad not been intended to include counter-intelligence, on the purpose andoperation of which he seemed to be completely at sea. He finally hadto accept the Chairman's ruling, that the Security Service conductedconsiderablle operations here of an offensive kind by technical means, andthat our interest in the present proposals was at least as great, if notgreater, than that of other members of the Committee.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMEN'T RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SEOTION(4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSAOT 1958.IT willl be seen from the Minutes that we are now included as one ofthe principal users, our sphere being described as "counter-intelligence"and the acquisition of intelligence in the U.K.", and that we aredefinitely included in the list of members of the higher committee.After the meeting was over I had a private talk with D.S.I. I saidthat I thought his attitude was due to a misapprehension of wha.t ourfunctions were. We welccmed his proposals for the setting up of thehigher commnittee, for the reasons that I had stated at the meeting, sincewe were vitallly interested in the procurement of information by scientificmeans in this country to assist in our investigation into Soviet andSatellite activities and the activities of subversive movemants. Apartfrom this, we had a ctefensive interest in any methods for the procurementof intelligence in order that we could guard against such methods beingused by the enemy. Lastly, there woulld inevitably arise the questionof the use ot such methods after satisfactory tests had been carried out.It would, for exmple, be a pity to bun the risk of compromising them throughoperations abroad i.f they could be more profitably used at home. This,however, would be a matter for discussion later on.25.I had the impression that what I said was rather an eye-opener toJones.Strong telephoned to me to say that he had been horrified by theJ.I.C. meeting, that he entirely agreed with my point Df view, and thathe thought it essential that Service and J.I.B. user interests shouldalso be represented on the committee.I gave him s cmething of the history of our operations in thescientific field and said that it seemed of little use for high-gradescientists to meet together if they did not now-precisely the problem to vhwe wished them to apply their minds.I had a talk with Geoffrey Patterson, who is just over fromWashington for a short time. He told me that the F.B.I. had anumber of spies on their books which they had traced as a resultof BRIDE. They could not, however, take any action at the momentas they had not been ble to get supporting evidence to give thenecessary cover.Burt telephoned to say that he had had lunch with Morgah Phillips,bu't that at the moment he had nothing further to communicate.I sympathised with him over the BENTLEY case. He said that thebehaviour of the PreSs and M. Ps had really been shocking; people seemedto think that it was the Home Secretary who was condemning BENTIHY.BENTLEY had been condemned by a Jury and sentenced by a Judge, and theHome Secretary's sole duty. vas to consider whether there were any groundswhich would justify his intervening. He had to take everyting intoconsideration, including the protection of the public against the presentcrime wave.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION30th January.3(4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958 Feb 2010I saw Hill about the Angllo-Austrian Trading Company. Thaveaddressed a minute to Dick, saying tha I think our next move is topproach the Inland Revenue and, although this may not tell us howTERN disposes of his profits, we should at least pursue the caseas far as we can. This had led me to think that we ought to do alllwe can to ascertain the cost of the Communist Party and of C.P.publications in this country, with a view to getting some estimate ofthe net loss of the consequent subsidy that must be coming in from abroad.But, more important st1ll, is to ascertain the channels through which itcomes. I feel that there is a rather serious gap in our information about26.Communist finance, and that ve ought to do all we can to fill it.At the Appointments Board to-day the following decisions werereached:-i) To accept Mr. SAVAGE'S offer to return to duty in mid-February and to post him to B. Division.ii)iii) Mr. HENLEY' departure for .I.F.E. to be deferred untilAugust, in order to give time for the changes in ii) aboveto take place.iv)Mr. D. STEPHENS' posting to Aden was confirmed but it wasagreed that no action should be talren on this decisionuntil Mr. Kellar's return in mid-February.v) t.Colonel FURNIVAL JONES was nominated aa H/S.I.M.E. viceBrigadier Stephens. D.C. will discuss the matter withFURNIVAL JONES before the recommendation is submitte tothe D.G.2.It was agreed that I would circulate the papers of a candidate,3.I said that H/S.I.F.E. had suggested that Mr. CRACE should bedetailed for service with the Special Branch in Singapore. It wasagreed to circullate the papers and dicuss the proposal further.L.D.B. was able to state that Mr. WADE'S service had been entirelysatisfactory and the Board agreed to proceed with his transfer fromthe Police to the Security Service at once.5. It was agreed that at Monday'e meeting with the D.G. BrigadierMAJOR'S application to remain in the Service after reaching the age of60 should be raised; also the guestion of Brigadier HINCHLEY COOKE'Eretirement.6.In view of the fact that Mr. MILLS and Mr. HERBERT are both dueto leave the Caribbean Area within one month of each other, it wasagreed that D.0.S. would write to Mr. MIILS and ask him to extendhis service for a few months in order to spread the carry-over.7. The draft onganisation Chart was agreed with slight amendments,and the draft notes were circulated for observattions.2nd February.THIS THISISACOPY COPyORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTIONTHE HE PUBLIO RECORDSACT 1958Felo 201027.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDINDEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3(4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSAOT 19582010I had a word wii th Reilly and told him that after the meetinglast Thursday I had had a talk with D.S.I. I thought that he wasnow more aware of the part that we played in offensive Intelligenceand of our consequent interest in the scientific comittee which hewas proposing should be set up.There have been further arrests in Moscow, which seem to indio catea security drive. Various people are being accused of careless tallkand careless handling of papers.This rather tends to confirm the view that the trials in Pragueand Moscow denouncing Zionists are preliminary security measuresdesigned to eliminate any organisation which constitutes a Statewithin the State.3rd February.Hill talked to me about a leakage of information through Reuters,disclosing certain discussions between ourselves and the Americans withregard to the evacuation of the Canal Zone. It seemed that Reutershad had access to a Foreign Office telegram which had been givenistribution to other Departments. Brook had ordered all Departmentsto account for their handling of the telegram. Reuter's correspondenthad approached the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office on theprevious day: both had said that they could make no statement, whichmight have been tantamount to an admission that discussions had takenplace. Both denied that they had given any details. It had beenascertained, however, that RHODES of the Foreign Office had attendeda party given at the Saudi Arabian Legation, at which Reuter'scorrespondent was present, and that both these individuals were onfriendly terms. It was immediately after this party that thecontents of the telegram were disclosed.RHODES has dended giving any information, but he has not beenquestioned about his access to the telegram.H11l had a conference yesterday with the Air Ministry aboutD. Notices. Tentative proposals put forward by HEIMANN of INTERAVIAin his discussion with Aamiral Thomson have been turned down and thePress have been asked to conform strictly to D. Notices. Meanwhile,we are to investigate the free-lance aeronauticall journalists hereand their conneotions with INTERAVIA.C. Division, in discussing certain vetting problems with theHome Office, have reached the concllusion that Home Office physicalsecurity is in a fairly weak state, and they feel that a fullinvestigation is necessary. It is suggested that I shoulld approach28.Newsam. As Critchley of the Establishments Branch in under Wood, Ithink it would be more appropriate to discuss it with Wood first.Newsam might be a little sensitiv if he thought we were pryingtoo deeply into Home Office affairs. I think it will be necessaryto prepare the ground before I tackle him.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER RSECTION(4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSAOT 1958. March 2010Lith February.At the J.I.C. we discussed a progress report by A.I.9 on escapeand evasion. It seemed that ve could use our good offices with DollisHill to provide certain number of pocket wireless sets. We are alsogoing to work out a scheme for code advertisements through the DailyWorker.Graham Mitchell has lectured at Porton on security. They seemedto be concentrating on the nerve gases, which appear to have a prettydevastating effect. He was told that during the war our gas maskswere not proof against arsine, a gas with a considerable arseniccontent. At one period we heard that the Germans were buyingconsiderable quantities of arsenic from Sveden.This led to a panicand a withdrawal of all our gas masks for special treatment. TheGermans heard about this and concluded that we were going to use arsineagainst them; they therefore proceeded to withdraw their gas masks. Inpoint of fact, the arsenic which they bought fron Sweden was for somecompletely different purpose and had no significance at all! I believethe cost of treating all our gas masks ran into millions.I talked to Hill about a new paper which had come in from theRegistrar for Scotland, on the subject of registration in war time.He studied the report by the Maxwell Committee; he had come to theconclusion that if certain particulars were added to food rationingdocuments it would provide a be'tter basis for ational Registrationthan any other. Priima facie, I think we would agree, provided thedocuments are carried and that there is some central point at whichverification can be effected.5th Februany.At the J.I.C. (Directors) meeting to-day there was. a longdiscussion about campaign studies. The Chiefs of Staff in theirpaper on global stra'tegy envisage a devastating blitzkrieg duringthe first month of any future war, but they and other Departmentsappear to require forward planning after the first month. Suchplanning would depend upon the pos sition of the enemy'e forces and our29.own, and on a knowlledge of our resources. For the purposes ofplanning, therefore, it is necessary either to have a purelyarbibrary estimate or to know what the effect of bombing by theAmerican Strategical Air Force is likely to have. As we do notknow the s'trength of their bombs, their capacity to deliver them,or the targets on which they intend to drop them, it is quiteimpossible to make anything in the na'ture of a calculated estimateof the position at the end of the firat month.We also had a discuasion on the latest American declarationabout Formosa. Some attempt is to be made to calculate the effect,particularly on Hong Kong, of various possible American moves. Itemerged during the discussion the t the American Director of NavalPlans had told his opposite number here that the Americans werecontemplating an amphibious operatio in North Korea with a view tocutting off large Chinese forces. It was estimated that this mightcose the United Nations about 40,000 in casualties, and it was hopedthat it would lead to favourable armistice negotiations.There were other suggestions about using Chinese nationalistforces in Korea, and for operations against Chinese mainland. Itis difficult to see hov such operations in the long run are going toget us much further or reduce the United Nations commitment in SouthKorea, even if an armistice is achieved.I gather that Dullles in his conversations herehas expressed alively interest in the defence of Hong Kong.At the Appointments Board to-day the following staff appointmentswere decided:MARTIN. D.B. said he would equest a replacement for thisofficer, but the post would be vacant in early March as MARTIN wouldrequire to make a tour of the Sections in the office, and also woulldwant embarkation leave. A.1 was asked to consider the question of anA.0.W. or a Grade 1.HAMBLEN. Agreed that the post of S.L.o. Australlia should beleft vacant whilst HAMBLEN was on leave.MILLS.He has rejected the reauest to extent his tour of duty bythree months, therefore his successor will have to arrive in June 1953.It was decided that D.C. should sound Felix JOHNSTONE on the subject,HERBERT.A relief will have to be found for the post ofS.L.o Trinidad. D.B. said he Would excamine the situation as to whocoulld be found From his Division.It was decided that HS.I.F.E. should be supported in his proposalto lend an officer for duties with Singapore Special Branch. D.0.S.will write to S.I.F.E. on this subject.Lectures. D asked that a review of the Lectures given by theDepartment to outside groups or other Departments should be made.Divisional Directors should supply A. Division with a list of thelectures given during the course of a year, giving officers and subjects.P.L.S. will submit their direct.30.Hollis heard from Dean, in Gambier Parry'a organisation, thatfairly recently no Less than 72 microphones have been unearthed inthe various residencess of our diplomatic mission in Bucharest.It is a strange thing that we do not seem to hear about thesethings from Carey Foster. The microphones were of American manufacture,dated about 1946. Some of them were placed at the end of radiatorg.Perhaps they are ones which the F.B.I. have installed in the RoumanianLegation in Washington! If this is the case we had better send themback to Micky Ladd with thanks.6th February.I attended the Defence (Transition) Committee meeting, at which thequestion of national registration in time of war was discussed. It wasfinally decided to accept Maxwell's recommendations. These imply thata national register would be required in time of war, and that a documentof identity would have to be carried by everyone. The only point ofdispute was whether this national register should be based on the recordsof the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Food or the Nationall Insurancerecords.The Registrar for Scotland, Hogan, had put in a six-page reportrecommending that they should be based on Ministry of Food records. Fora variety of reasons, which have been carefullly gone into by Maxvell'scommittee, the principle being that food rationing might have beenabollished before the end of a war, whereas national insurance wouldalmost certainly continue, it was decided to accept Maxwell's recommendationthat the national register should be an extension of the nationalinsurance records, complicated as this might be.It emerged during the discussion that some 750,000 ration books werereported lost every year. One of the main reasons was the uncontrolledtraffic to Ireland, and the fact that a number of peophe succeeded in gettingholdof two ration books.9th February.At the D.Gs meeting I told him about the results of the meetingof the Defence (Transition) Committee held last week. We had beensatisfied so long as there was some central point to which we couldrefer for names, date of birth and address, and that each person wasunder an obligation to carny his document of identity in time of war.It was a matter of comparative indifference to us whether the basisof these records was Health, National Insurance o Food.Horrocks mentioned that the whole problem would be considerablysimplified if everybody had a number which could be used for NationalRegistration Food, Insurance, etc. This is, T think, the aim of theauthorities, but it will doubtleBs take years to achieve. They willhave to retain the National Insurance numbers as at present and useothers for the remaining 25,000,000 of the population who do not comeunder that scheme..31.THIS IS A COPYI saw Nevsam about the KERR case.OBIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDDEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958lOth February.March 2010I went to an Investitube this morning to receive my 0.B.12th February.At the J.I.C. to-day Reilly mentioned a suggestion which had beencirculated (under C.0.S. 53/32 of 30.1.53.) that there should be anintegrated effort between ourselves and the Americans in research onavesdropping devices, such as those proposed by Brundrett a short timeago.I tool the opportunity of making it clear that in the previouspaper put up by Brundrett to the Chief's of Staff and approved by them,it had been stated that the liaison channel was Via the F.B.I to ourselves.This liaison referred solely to the microphones discovered in Moscow andhad no bearing on the vIider field of research. We had notified theSecretariat, but the report had already been sent to the Chiefs of Staff.It appears that by 2 a.m. to-morrow we may be at war with theArgentine! For Some time they have been infiltrating their nationallsinto islands on the outer perimeter of the Falllands, which we regardour dependencies. It seems that they have now gone too far and thatction is to be taken, Some of them have camped on the football fieldof one of the larger islands and are to be removed. H.M.S. Snipe, a sloop,is proceeding to the area in order to give the Local authorities thenecessary support. The Americans have been told anditalte the mattercalmly, but may of course react more violently later.Reilly mentioned that Dulles is urging that the French should exertaln their energies to building up the Vietnam Army, although it is adrnittedthat they may want some logistic support in holding the ring until thishas been achieved. This seems to be more or less in line with Eisenhowert Spolicy of making the Asians fight the AsiansTrafford Smith mentioned to me that there was some concern in theColonial Office abou't the suggestion that Johnson, the former InspeciorGenerall of Police, had put in a long report about improvements in Kenya,none of which had been implemented, and that if they had the Governmentwould have been in a much stronger position to deal with the presentemergency. Trafford Smith said that in fact allll Johnsont S recommendationshad been accepted and put into force.In discussing the Perimeter Review, it was mentioned that theGerman reactions to our censorship revealed that the evidence againstNAUMANN and Co. had been negligible. This vas satisfactory as it wouldprobably help our case in continuing censorship until the German Governentwere in a position to take it over themselves. Dulles, during his recentisit to Germany, had a discussion with the leaders of the S.P.D.. He wassomewhat surprised tha't they stll maintained their opposition to the EuropealDefence Committee.32.In Korea it was mentioned that, according to Tokyo, the build upof some 80 twin-engined jet bombers, IL 28s, by the Russians constituteda threat to our forward airtields and other installations. The AirMinistry do not agree; they think that the Russians would not risk theloss of one of these mew types, Which would allmost inevitably resul't.Some members of the Comnittee thought that thesuprly of armamements toChiina mus't constitute a serious drain on Russian resources. Kenneth Strongdid not agree; he thought it was merely an exxample of the power andresilience of Russian econamy, Meanwhile, of course, the Russiansare milking their Western satellites.In Egypt a settlement appears to have been reached on the questionoftheSudan, much to everyone's surprise. Even the Governor of theSudan, who has been very belilicose and criticall of Stethenson Caino.thinks that the deal. is a reasrnably good one.ORIGINALThis IS A COPYDEPARTMENT DOCUMENT UNDER RETAINED SECTION(4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSAt the Appointments Boand this afternoon T drew attentionfrom Kellan, from which it appears that he has had a prettyfrom the Governor and the Colonial Secretary in Aden. He was aslcedprecisely the same question that I have been asking ever since the Adenproject was mooted, namely, "What precisely are the problems which necessityyour presence here?ir D.0.S said that a letter had just come in fromKelllar which might contain. the answer. T said that we had been proceedingalll. along on the assumption that the Governor wanted an S.L.O. in Aden;we now learned that he did not. It seemed to me that the whole questionought to be reviewed in the light of this nes information, and that theD.G. should give us his decision on Monday.D.E./A, reported that, while a certain number of the securitymeasures recommended for Hanover Square could and voula be put intoforce, the Ministry of Works were in difficulties when it involvedanything in the nature of structural alterations because of the lease.For this reason grilles Or bars to the windows were out of the question.We had already asked the Ministry for 44,000 Sa. ft. more space, andin these circumstances it was agreed that we should bring more pressureto bear on the Ministry to give us one building to contain the whole ofthe overflow stafe which woulld be more secure than Hanover Square, bu'tshould not be further away from Leconfield House.The Board agreed not re reopen the case of Mr. MOCHETT.The Board agreed that D.E/A. should see car.

Mavch Q0L013th February.I prepared a note for the D.G. about the impasse reached a't theAppointments Board this week on the question of Aden. After discussionwith Hollis, we decided merely to seek the D.GIs reconsideration of thecase on the basis of:(i)The Governor' luke-warm support;(ii)the unimpressive nature of the Intelligence needsin Kellar' S inemorandum;(iii)the indifferent accomodation. Which could only be fora single officer. and(iv) the shortage of trained staff due to the loss of peoplelike MacDonald, Broaabent, Carrel and Morton.16th February.At the D.G's meeting to-day IY note on Aden VIaS discussed.The D.G went through the various points about Intelligence needsin Kellar' S memorandum, Which he thought substantiated the case foropening a post at Aden. He did not think tha't we should pay anyattention to the Governorte misgivings,I gave the reasons why we thought Kellar's statement about theIntelligence needs was unimpressive. For example, in Aden it is dificultto see what an S.L.0. could do without a proper S.B. and so far as thehinterland was concerned it was merely a matter for M.D.6 nather thanfor ourselves. It had occurred to us that the job could be done quitesimly by a visiting officer from S. I.M.E.Dick White reinfarced this argument, although ve all agreed tha'tif you sent a good security officer to any part of the Erpire he coulldallways find something to d.o. We had, however, to balance up this needwith more pressing ones at the present time.The D.C finally mulled that the post should be opened as and whenasuitable ofieer could be spared, and thet he must be a Single officer.ick White agreed to sound out De WESSELOW when he returned from lleave.It was possible that he might e anxious to go abroad, but if he weme nothe could justifiably plead that he had only returned from service abroadabout to years ago.34.17th Februany.I leatured to the Police course of Railway Police, W.D.C. andAdmiralty Pollice, who seemed generally alert and interested in the workthat we were doing.We have an interesting case running connected with a C.P membernamed Eaward SMITH, Who is training two Cypriots in Wireless procedure.who it is believed are to open an illicit station in Cyorus. They arebeing instructed in high-speed morse.I have sent a note to D.B. on Comunist finances. a subject abou'tWhich we seen to be singullarly ignorant. I feel fairly confident thatthe Party and its Press mus't incur a considerable deficit which isunlikely to be made up entirely by welll-wishers such as Eva RECKITT andNAHUM. My feeling is that even if only a trickle of information iscoming in, we should do all we can to ascertain the channel throgh Whichit passes. If at some later date the flow of funds increases and actionis required, we shal.l look mather silly if we are i-informed on thissomewhat important subject.18th Februar.Boddington came to see me to-day. He had two questions.One, he had seen Pe'ter Reid, Chief of Staff Por'tsmou'th, in connectionwith the Fleet Review in June. He himself would be responsiblle forattempts by any unauthorised persons to obtain access to dockyards, buthe wondered whether we should wish him to stimllate the Bolice tocheck up on alien registration in the area, since it seemed that therewould be a number of foreigers who vrould be interested in gaininginformation, Both Domiion and Allied ships are to take pant in theReview in addition to Russian. I said that I would think about thisand let him low.The second point related to sabotage enquinies that he had beencarrying out on certain of H.M. Ships. He sent a copy of his reportto the C-in-C and one to N.I.D.. and he wondered Whether a copy shouldbe sent to us as well. I told him to consult Hollis.I attended an interminabble meeting of the J.I.C. Deputies to-day,Which ended in the old wrangle between the War Office and J.I.B. on theone hand and the Air Ministry onsthe other, on the subject of thelikely uses to which the Chinese, Soviet and North Korean Air Forcesmight be put.The Air Ministry argued tha't althoughthese Air Forces coulld quiteeasily attack our forvtard air bases, causing them considerable damage,they would not vish to risk retaliattion on their bases i.n Manchuria.They think, moreover, that the Russians Would not wish to haire oneThey do not seem to take mmuch account of a new situation which mightof their 1.L.28 twin-engined jet bombers worked down over U.N. territory. arise35.if our policy in Korea became a more aggressive one.

OurYforwardaerodromesinKoreaareeasilydeetectablebynight,sincetheydo not. apparrntly exercise any Air Raid Precautions they are in ablaze of light.Our other paper related to the situation in lIndo-China. Anattempt was made to estimate what vaB necessary from a purely militarypoint of view to clean up the Whole situation. It vaS felt that theVietnamese forces with a limited French Staff could not be built upto contain the Viet Minh forces until 1.957 and that at east three moreFrench Divisions would be needed to clean Up the situation before it couldbe handed over to the Vietriam Government.The Foreign office - I think rightly - felt that to say that theFrench could maintain the status quo With their existing forces wasunrealistic, since a whole mumnber of other political factors werelikely to operate.The war in Indo-China is just as much a running sore in Pranceas the war in Korea is to the United States. The fact is that theFrench Government v/ould like to clear out of Indo-China, provided theycould do 6O without losing too much face. They do not see much funin building up the Vietnamese Forces and sending extra troops at theexpense of their European commitments if a't the end of it all they are tohand over to Viet Nam without compensation,19th February.I had a talle with R.V. Jones after the J.I.0. Directors meeting.He seemed to be considerably annoyed about Jack Easton's letter, makingit appear that M.I.6 had always counted on the Security Service beingan interested participant in the proposed work of the new ScientificIntelligence Committee and, a propos of this, showed me a copy of theS.I.S. draft of the paper Which is n.ow before the J.I.C. He drew myattention to para. 5. from which the Security Service were oumitted asmembers of the main committee,E said that we to had been surprised. since Jack Easton hadwide knowledge of Our office and its interests.I had a wond with Brigadier Lewis of the Jersey Police. He has1o Comrunist problem of any importance in his area. He did, however, dramy attention to the fact that it was quite easy for anyone to get out ofthis country Via Jersey to the Continent without being deteeted. Thereis T thinle only a distance of fifteen milcs to the French coast andthere ane many fishing boats which operate from the Island.

He said that Cholmondeley hoped perhaps that one dayhe might stand a chance of coming into ou office, and I rather gatheredthat he had it in mind that if he accepted something from Montagu thismight prejudice his chances.I told Butler that these must be two entirely separate issues.There could be no question of Cholmondeley coming to u's and suggestingthat we were under some obligation to him because he had turned dowm82,000 from Montagu. He, Butler, however, vas in some difeiculty in givingCholmondeley aavice seeing that Drew had approached the Air Ministry whohad given a Clearance for Cholmendeley to recedve the money if he wished todo So. II said T thought he should confine himself to giving purelly legal37.advice, which woulld be to the effect that if Cholmondeley accepted themoney, he vould not in any way place himself in jeopardy. For the rest,T thought he should say that it was simply a matter for Cholmnndeley'wn conscience. I coulld only say that if I were in the same circurnstancesL should feel extremely uncomfortable about receiving any share OfMontagu's proceeds however great they might be. Butler said he entirelyagreed. He then told me that Montagu was to get 22,750 down fom theDaily Express. plus E40O for the syndication rights, plus an aaditionalsum for publication in the Readers Digest. He vas getting 21,500 dowfor his book, plus Royalties. and he had the film rights, eoncerning whichno deal had yet been made. In other words, he stood to make at least85,000, E1,500 of which he was prepared to give to Cholmondeley.At the D.GIs meeting I raised the question of our representationon the Overseas Committee, from which D.O0.S. intervened to say that he hadalready written to Mason suggesting that we chould be ex-officio members.The D.G seemed to approve.At the Appointments Board tn-day it was agreed thatshould be posted to Aden for the normal period of four years.I gave a short review of the Courses and Lectures which theService was called upon to give.

NormanBrook had circulated all Departments to ascertain what had happenedto their copy of this telegram. Brook had now written to us to saythat a secretary in the Cabinet Office was responsible. She hadtaken her work home and had thrown the carbon in her wastepaper basket.This had been used by the nurse to wrap up a spare part of the stove.It is satisfactory that the case has been solved. but we have writtenback to Brook suggesting that it would be salutary if. without mention-ing the name of the Department, other Departments could be informedabout what had happened and their attention drawn to those paragraphsof the regulations which prohibit the taking of documents out of theoffice. We also asked that we might be authorised to use thisincident in our security talks to Departments, again without mentioningnames.I saw Robertson. Reid and de Wesselow about the case of LAIRD.It was a question of the interpretation of BRIDE about which therehad been considerable argument. on scrutiny of the text it seemedto me that New York must have informed Moscow of what they had arrangedwith LAIRD in order that Moscow could pass on the arrangement to theircontact in Los Angeles; from which it follows that LAIRD must havebeen aware of the Clandestine nature of his mission. Personally Ido not think there is any room for doubt.I also discussed with Robertson the position reached in theSHAG case as the result of a minute put up to me by Dick concerninga proposal to hand over a number of Air Ministry files. I intendto read these files in onder to get the feeling of the whole case.Meanwhile I thought it would be useful if we could get out a clearstatement of the .E. advantages incorporating:a) the information already obtained:bthe information we hope to obtain in the future; andc)the advantages in var, keeping in mind that it might benecessary to keep the case running for 5, 10 or 15 years.Robertson seemed to think that we could quite easily keep thecase going by supplying lower grade information. Drev, on the otherhand, felt that we had to keep the information on a high level if hewas to be in a position to pass over the high grade deception requiredby the Chiefs of Staff. In any case, it seems to me that we must be/absolutelyLil.absolutely clear about our responsibilities. If we are askedto vet these files from the security angle and do so. we areto some extent accepting the responsibility. Ontheotherhand,I have an uncomfortable feeling that unless this traffic islooked at objectively by someone who is in the whole intelligencepicture we may be losing more than we gain.I had a long talk with Alec Kellar about his visit toAfrica and the Middle East. He still seems to conceive arole for the S.LO. which to me seems to be outside the S.L.0.'sprovince. Whatever trouble has arisen in the Colonies, ithas almost invariably been due either to there being no SpecialBranch or an inadequate Special Branch. T am inclined to thinka strengthening of the position of the Inspector General of thePolice in the Colonial Office is likely to produce the best answer.The Inspector General should be a man of considerable standingwith direct access to the Under Secretary of state and theColonial Secretary, and should have under him three or fourfirst-class officers of the type of MacDonalld. These officersshould be sent out to ensure that everything possible was done tobuild up Special Branch work, and they could work in close touchwith our S.L.0. The difficulty of course is that SpecialBranches were alllowed to lapse at the end of the war and thatin many Colonies where there is a Legislative Council with blacksin office it is a matter of considerable difficulty to intro-duce white Special Branch officers. This is, of course, notthe case in places like Kenya, where such appointments can easilybe made. In the Gold Coast and Nigeria, on the other hand,there are very great difficulties. Personally I do not seehow an S.L.O." office can in any sence be considered a microcosmof Head Office. In London we are the focal point for allinformation relating to espionage and subversive movements andwe have our own sources which are better than those of the Police.The Police are in fact subsidiary. In a Colony, however, thePolice are the main, if not the entire, producers of informationand no S.L.O. without detailed local knowledge of the people andtheir language should try to compete with them. He cannot as arule have any centralised sources, technical on otherwise, of hisown, and the only way in which he can really help is by adviceand by supplying information about international subversive move-ments which might impinge upon indigenous movements within theColony28.2.53.Robertson and Stewart came to see me about thecase.It had been arranged that Walsh, an official at the Embassy, whenquestioned byabout the record against him in America,should stall and try and give the impression that there werefacts in the United States in support of what the British toldhim. Unfortunately, T.C. shows that Walsh did not play his/part12.part very well and thet there is some doubt whetherwillnow seek an interview with a higher official in the Embassy.It had been arranged that if he did this Johnnie Cimpermanwould be brought into the question. John would then have theopportunity of going over his whole career in considerabledetail. and James will see Cimperman and endeavour to get thecase back on the rails.Carter, of the A.S.1.0., has been doing a course here and cameto say goodbye.2.3.53.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958 March 20loI lunched with Dan de Bardeleben. ie discussed thesituation in Korea. He is clearly in favour of action. whichwould go as far as the bombing of Manchurian bases and take therisk of Russian intervention. This matter will doubtless bethe subject of discussion between Eden and Dulles in Washington.I had a Directors' Meeting today and Hollis raised thequestion of the security of the project to explode anotheratomic bomb. Air Vice-Marshal EImhirst has been appointedby Lord Cherwell to take charge of the security of the operation.Duncan Sandys was apparently anxious that we should send out anofficer, but we had pointed out that A.S.I.0. .S. handled their ownsecurity very satisfactorily at Montebello, and that we had anofficer in Melbourne who would cooperate in this new project ashe had done in the previous oneSubsequently, however, vediscovered that Derek Hamblen was corning on leave. He willhowever be back in Melbourne by August lst and Hollis vill seeElmhirst and ascertain with him whether this arrangement issatisfactory. It would obviously be very difficult for usto send out another officer without giving offence to theAustralians.Hollis also mentioned that there woulld be a Cabinet Meetingon Thursday to consider the paper by Duncan Sandys on theextension of the purge system to industry. We considered thismatter to be fraught with considerable danger. Under clause 59of our contractual agreement, the Ministry of Supply have/the rightL3the right to objeot to certain individuals being employed on theirwork. It is thus for the employer either to refuse a contract orto move the individual to some other job in his factory, or if hecannot find him other employment to dismiss him. If we bring thesepeople under the purge procedure, it means that someone, presumablythe employer. has to tell him that he is accused of being a Communistor associated in such a way with Communists as to cause reasonabledoubt's about his reliability, and if he so desires he can go beforethe Three Advisers. This woulld seem to lay the Government open tolibel action and if such a case were brought we should be callled uponto produce the evidence. This would land us in an impossible positionsince the evidence would be of such a nature as to preclude thepossibility of its being used in court.It is suggested that we should brief Sir Harold Parker and thatpossibly I should see the Home Secretary, who is Chairman of theCommittee, and leave with him a memorandum and explain the contents.A report has been received from the Middle East from a well placedsource in the Ikhwan which indicates that Cuckney and some others areon a list for assassination. It is possible that this report has beendeliberately planted on us in order to dislocate our organisation; moreprobably, hovever, it is true, but the action may vell not be contem-plated unless the negotiations for our withdrawal from the Canal Zonebreak down. In any case it is difficult to see what we can do exceptto ensure that Cuckney takes ald reasonable precautions, which no doubthe is doing.Hill came to talk to me about the check on HRRING. I explainedtohim what had happened and he agreed that for the time being the actionvas right in confining ourselves solely to communications coming fromabroad His] has very strong views about extending the purge toindustry and is surprised that the Treasury Solicitor has not beenbrought into the discussions.Lilh.3.3.53.I had a word with D.O.S., firstly about Cuckney. I thoughtwe ought to get some assessment from Stephens about the reliabilityof the report in which it was mentioned that Cuckney was on a listfor assassination by the IKHWAN, and that we might say that wepresumed that Cuckney would be taking such precautions as werepracticable. It did not seem to me that we could do more thanthis, Personally I doubted whether the IKHVIAN would attempt tocarry out their threat unless the negotiations with the Englishover the Canal Zone finally broke down.As regards the passing of the information to the Americansabout penetration of their Embassy in Cairo, it seemed to meimportant that this should be handled by S.I.M.E. who shouldendeavour through Foulkes to control any security measures whichmight result, otherwise the source was likely to be in danger.I then discussed the successor to Leightous.L.( Malaya.Wehad suggested Tolson or Fletcher. Courtenay was inclined tothink that Fletcher was a little too inexperienced and had approachedTolson, who said that he was not anxious to leave Singapore. D.0.S.and I agreed that the finall decision should rest with Courtenay,but that possibly the S.L.O.'s job would have reverted to itsoriginal status and would not therefore be beyond the capabilitiesof Fletcher, who woulld have Carrel within the Force to give himguidance and information.The wireless this morning announced that Stalin has had astroke.

Wilson Smith's secretary had the minutes in a filingcabine't and over a period of 24 hours they were found to be missingand. have not since been recovered. There is no security whateverin the building and anybody could have walked into her room andtaken the file away. It is doubtful therefore whether the case canbe solved. The lesson is that no such committee ought to be setup without proper security precautions being worked out in advance.Hollis has prepared a revised draft for the Home Secretary onthe proposals by the Minister of Bupply to extend the purge appealsystem to industry.Stewart has had a 5 hours interview withbut got no45.further.

I explained to him the implications ofpara. 2 (a) from the point of view of our sources of information, andsaid that it seemed to us that once the Minister went further thanclause 59 of the contrast he was on a slippery slope and so in factwere we. The Home Secretary said that that particular section of thelaw which would apply was an extremely intricate one and in his experienceit would be wise not to become involved in it. I explained theimplications in full of para. 2 (b) and (c). It would be virtuallyimpossible for us to disclose our sources to such a tribunal, and withouta full kowledge of the facts they could perform no useful function.The Home Secretary fully accepted the vievs expressed in para. 2 (e)and agreed that if the new procedure were instituted security wouldundoubtedly suffer. I told him that neither the Joint AdvisoryCouncil nor, I believe, the Ministry of Defence or the Treasury werein favour of the proposals. I feel c onfident that he will opposethem himself.I told the Home Secretary about the leakage case affectingbacteriological warfare.At the I.C. D.S.I. asked me whether I could let him see thefiles on POWEIL, the Cosmic ray expert, with whom he was in fairlyfrequent touch. I said that I thought we would probably have amemorandum about him, which II would let him see.We discussed first the case of Korea. The Directors of Planswere anxious to know whether, if an amphibious operation were success-fully carried out and resulted in capture of a large portion of theChinese forces and their supplies and the line subsequently establishedacross the neck of Korea, it would be likely to lead to an armistice,and if so whether such an armistice would be in the nature of an uneasytruce. Considerable doubt was expressed by the D.M.I. and otherswhether such an operation would be successful unless we intended toincrease our commitment and were prepared to accept considerablelos losses.This seemed also to be the view of the Directors of Plans, but assumingthat the operation were suceessfully carried out the Committee tookthe view that it would not necessarily lead to an armistice, and certainlyto no more than an uneasy truce. They felt further, that to hold aline across the neck of Korea would in many respects place us at adisadvantage since the Chinese could built up considerable forces inManchuria, particularly tactical air support which coulld carry out anoffensive at short notice. It seemed almost certain that if an/amphibious416.amphibious operation were carried out the Chinese would use theirManchurian based aircraft and that therefore an attack on aerodromesin Manchuria would follow.Stalin's illness was discussed and also its possible effects.Our Ambassador in Moscow seemed to think that Molotov was morelikely to succeed than Malenkov, but like everyone else he hasnothing to go on. It seemed to me a little curious that in theirPress announcement the Soviet authorities had signed the bulletinas a Committee and that they had in fact mentioned that Stalinhad lost his power of speech. This might possibly be thxk anindication that the question of his successor is still fluid.Reilly said that Kirkpatrick had had an interesting convers-ation with Adenauer after his return from Rome. Adenauer hadbeen particularly depressed by the attitude of Bidault who, havingagreed to the terms of the communique, had, on his return to Paris.been talking in a different since. He thought that Bidault wasinsincere and indecisive. He felt therefore that the four powersshould ratify as soon as possible and that something should be doneto win over theFrench socialists. It has occurred to me that thismight be the clue to what appears to be the interest of the Russiansin an individual previously mentioned as 'Joliot'D.A.O.S.I. mentioned that a Polish pilot had made a forcedlanding in a M.I.G. 15 on the island of Bornholm. A technicalteam from the Air Ministry is leaving for Bornholm today toexamine the plane. This is the first opportunity we have hadof looking at a M.I.G. 15 since the one was fished out of the seaoff the Korean coast more than a year ago.6.3.53.Stalin died early this morning, but there is no announcementabout his successorI discussed with Roger the question of courses for immigrationofficers. They have 300 candidates and want a course once a monthfor 25. Hollis wi.ll discuss the syllabus and see whether it isnot possible to reduce the numbers.We have had a letter from Fressanges in which he states thathe woulld like us to second a security officer to the Air Ministry toLook into the whole state of their security over a period of 6 months.In this, he says, he has the concurrence of Barnes, the P.U.S.I am afraid we shall have to take on this job, but I do not thinkit is quite what Fressanges imagines it to be since a good deal ofthe work under our guidance will have to be done by his own staff.We cannot possibly be expected to estimate the need to know in thepassing of papers.47.There is a case going on down at Margate, known as theWidow Twankey case. wheregave information aboutthe mysterious doings of her husband, who is of Czech origin.A search warrant was obtained and interrogation vas carriedout.

We would on the whole havepreferred Molotov as being an older man and one who has had someexperience of the outside world. Malenkov, who is 52, has neverleft Russia.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDDEPARTMENT IDER SECTION9.3.53.3 (4 OF THE RECORDSACT 1958.

The HomeSecretary had our case well in mind and was supported by HaroldParker, by the Treasury and by the Minister of Labour. It wasquite clear to all that Duncan Sandys' proposals would get everyoneinto trouble.Boddington came to see me. He mentioned that Mr. F.N.

He had justconducted a tour of 15 women from the American Section of theWorld Federation of Women.They visited the Middle East, India,Malaya, and Japan, and they all returned with a half-baked view ofworld affairs! In Cairo they drank coffee with Neguib and thenasked him if they could keep their cups, to which he assented)The Widow Twankey case is stilll unsolved.49.113.53.Goodvyn rang me up about a proposed Foreign Office telegramto Eden suggeating that he should tel Dulles about the leakage inthe American Embassy in Cairo. This had been reported to D.S.0.Canal by an IKHWAN agent I told Goodwyn to endeavour to ensurethat if the Americans were to be told we should give them theinformation in Cairo and try to control any enguiries that theymight make within the Embassy, otherwise it semed likely that ourinformant would be blown.At the J. J.I.0. today. D.S.I.'s report on 'Scientific Developmentand Research in Russia' was discussed. On the somewhat meagreevidence availablle he had concluded that, with a few notableexceptions, there was not much original thought in research. Itseems that the Russians, adided by Germans, had been copying British.German and Amnerican equipment, which in some cases they had improvedupon. The M.I.G. 15 was a case in point. The Committee felt howeverthat there were no grounds for complacency since Russian securitywas so good that it might well be that they had new weapons of whichwe had no knowledge. They did in fact have a new tank, but over aperiod of years it has been quite impossible to obtain any detailsabout its performance It was mentioned that the Foles were venyinsistent in their demands for the return of the M.I.G. which had beenlanded by a Polish pilot on the island of Bornholm. The Danes weregetting a bit windy and insist that our investigations should becompleted by Monday next. They do not want us to fly the aeroplaneas they think they would be in serious difficulties if the pilothad to make a crash landing. Effort are being made to persuadethem to give us an extra week, and the opportunity to test the planein the air. The pillot, after interrogation, will probably be senton here.

We have to consider whether we cansupply anybody or alternatively whether there is anybody in B.I.0.G.or S. I.S. who could be trained up to carry out this task. On thebasis of our activities in support of our Armed Forces in the MiddleEast, it would be logical for us to have someone in Germany as longas the occupation forces remain.13.3.53.I have obtained further information from my informant aboutthe two Germans who met MOSLEY at the Russell Hotel in DubllinonFebruary 9th or lOth.

March ROLOThere has been a frightful flap over a telegram despatchedfrom the J.I.C. Germany to J.I.C. London based on informationreceived from the Americans that 14 Yugoslavs are coming overvia Rome and France to land illegall.y in motor boats to assassinateTito. Unfortunately, this telegram was sent to the P.M. who wasnot unnaturally rather concerned. Had we been consulted we shoulldhave been able to say that the information came from a Februaryedition of a Yugosllav monanchist paper published in Rome, theeditor of which is not highly regarded even by his own supporters.I think it is a case of the wish being father to the thought. We/had this51.had this report more than a week ago and passed it to the Yard.Fortunately I was able to tell Montague Browne of Downing Streetin order that he could reassure the P.M, that the matter, for whatis was worth, was in hand. T also took the opportunity of makingit cllear that Scotland Yard were the focall point for all intelligencein regard to Tito since they were responsible for his protection. Wehave informed the J.I.C., who are circulating a note to all recipientsof the telegram.T had a discussion with Dick, James and Anthony about the SHAG case.Having reviewed the matter very carefully I felt that some directivefrom the Chief Staff Officer to the Minister of Defence or from theChiefs of Staff should be issued making it clear that we had noresponsibility for the information passed exeept in so far as itmight endanger the security of our agent. I felt, however, thatthe cumulative effect of the information it was proposed to passnow might be to disclose a good deal about the whole workings of theintelligence machine. It seemed to me that this matter could beconsidered by the Chairman of the J.I.0. From what Reilly told meyesterday, it was clearly his impression that we examined the inform-ation to be passed from the point of view of the security of Intelligenceasawhole. It was agreed that I shoulld speak to Drew first and thenhave a talk with him and Reilly. My memorandum on this subject isin file 603, 341. vol. 5.14.3.53.Burt rang me up to say that the Commissioner of Police had beensummoned to Downing Street at 3 p.m. this afternoon. I said thatIthought his visit would probably have something to do with the telegramfrom B.I.0.G. T told Burt that we had already sent him this informationmore than a week ago, and that we had not rated it very nighly. TheP.M. is, however, very sensitive about the dangers of Tito beingassassinated and quite rightly intends to see that every possibleprecaution is taken.16.3.53.There was a Staff Board meeting today:.According to a telegram from the Governor of Nyasaland BrigadierMajor has turned down the offer of the appointment of' Defence Secretaryafter a visit to the area. The Governor has asked us to loan anofficer or to suggest another candidate. The Boand felt that itwas out of the question for us to loan an officer. Mr. White will makeenguiries about a Staff Officer recommended for employment here byColonel Cumming, and if this fails some approach could be made tothe Wir Office, who must have many suitable retired Brigadiers ontheir list.D.D.G mentioned a telegram from Brigadier STEPHENS suggestinga personal visit home to disouss his future appointment. A reply hasbeen sent asking him to put his observations in writing./D.D.G52.D.D.G. asked aboutJD.O.S. stated thet he had beencleared by the doctor and that he would be leaving some time afterthe 20th April.D.B. raised the question of the advisability of our appointingan officer to Germany to assist the Germans in building up theirsecurity organisation. It was agreed that however desirable thismight be we were not in a position at the moment to supply anofficer. The matter might perhaps come up for consideration laterwhen his duties might be combined with those of E.D.C. security.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DEPARTMENT DOCUMENT RETAINEDACT 3 4) 1958 OF THE March PUBLIC UNDER RECORDS SECTION201017th March.Dick.

The 'plane had been picked to Piecesby a team of British and Danish experts and the fullest possibleparticulars have been obtained alout its construction and performance.There were no real surprises.

This decision should be conveyed to him, subjectto the agreement of D.O.S.The Board agreed that there was not a sufficiently strong case todepart frorn normal procedure of recruiting younger officers in favourof Mr. CHOLMONDELEY. D.E./A woulld inform B.4 of this decision.D.E./A mentioned that a reply had been received from the P.U.S.to the War Office, stating that he could not accept our general proposalthat the female staff should travel First Class in Troopships.

The Board agreed that BrigadierHINCHLEY COOKE should be informed that any such recall in the event ofwar was most unlikely.There was some discussion on the request of the Governor ofNyasaland that we should loan an officer to act as Defence Secretary, andas it had been agreed that we could not do this, the Board agreed that weshould inform the War Office of the vacancy and ask if they coulld nominateany suitable retired Officers who would like to have the appointment.This would be done subject to any conments D.O.S. may wish to make abou'tthe advisability of notifying the Governor of the action we propose.Holmes came to talk to me about two letters from ,C.

I told Holmes to see Kirby Gillette the officer incharge of U.S.A.F. O.S.I. in this country, and try to tactfully talle himout of the requests mentioned in the second letter from C.0 Kent.57.T wrote to C.C. Kent and told him that we had various channelsof liaison with the U.S. Embassy, one of Which was between the PoliceLiaison Section here and Colonel Kirby Gillette. The amount of securityinformation passed to O.S.I regarding individuall was strictly limitedand dependent upon the facts presented in each case. When Police areapproached for information regarding individuals we suggest that theyinfor'm the O.S.I. S. agent concerned that he will receive a reply from hisown head office, or advise him to make the enquiry direct through thatchannel. At the same time we are pleased to be informed of the natureof any such enquiry and to be given any relative security informationthat the Police have about it. this, of course. interfered in no waywith the direct contact between O.S.I. and the Police on purely criminalmatters. In this particular case we had no informatior here about theindividuals mentioned by O.S.I.20th March.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION(4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958Mavc2010I had a general talk with Furnival Jones about Communists in theaircraft industry.In the case of De Havillands the position is weak, since De Havillandshave no secret contract. On the other hand they have aircraft in thedevelopment stage and might produce a world-shaker at any moment. Wehave, therefore, after considerable difficulty got them to agree to accepta vet of their ernployees.The attitude of the Ministry of Supply is in many ways rather weak.If, for example, a skilled carpenter is engaged in making "mock-ups" ofsome highly secret plane, he is not regarded as being of sufficientintelligencetograsptheVitalprinciples.Heisthereforefelttobe only dangerous in SO far as he might steal secret plans or aet as atalent spotter. This. the Ministry of Supply feel, is an acceptablerisk, but as Furnival Jones says, if the Air Ministry knew that therewere no less than 60 Commnists employed at De Havillanas they wouldhave a fit.This led me to discuss our responsibilities in a matter of thiskind. It has allways been our policy to assist and advise Ministers,and if we go beyond this we do begin to constitute oursellves as somethingof a Gestapo, with the risk that Departments will dry up on us. It isour belief that security can really only be improved by persuasion. Onthe other hand, it does seem to me that security in Ministries is not taken58.seriously, and that this can only be done by the appointment of a reallyhigh-povered Security Officer in each Ministry with direct access to theUnder-Secretary of State or to the Minister.I have been summoned to a meeting on April 15th with Bridges andhis colleagues in conneetion with the appointment of the D.Gis successor.Dick has received a similar summons.Hi] attended a meeting of the Travel Bil. designed to give powersto prevent a British subject from leaving the country for a period of14 days pending interrogation. This Bill had been opposed by Cornish,clearly on the instructions ofNewsam. Cornish got a rough passage ViithNorman Brook, who said that he could not see that such a Bill wouldconstitute any serious infringement of the liberty of the subject.Hill was satisfied by the Treasury Solicitors that the making of thisBill a part of the Official Secrets Act wouldohot cause the Act to bedebated as a whole in the House of Commons. He also arranged that thereference to MACLEAN and BURGESS, as an example of the uses to which theTravel Bill might have been put, should be removed when the proposals ventforward to the Home Secretary and the Foreig Secretary.HaRECORDS2010Michael Serpell tells me that there is a possibility that the Czechsmight continue to employafter he has remained in quarantine" forabout eight months.

As we understood the position we wereonly looking at these files from the point of view of the security of our ownagent. (Would they, for example. be regarded byas typicaldeception material, oving to their being largely out off date, o2 would theyeventually lead the agent into a cul-de-sac should he be aslced to produce furtherinformation showing more recent developments on the questions therein discussed?)we did not, however, regard ourselves as in any way responsible for giving asecurity clearance for the information these files contained; this weconsidered to be a matter for Drew himeelf.Drew agreed that this was the position, although he did say that incertain respects ve had drawn his attention to security issues which might arisein regard to information passed through our channels.I told Drew that I had looked at his Charter and that, although he had toobtain clearance from the Chiefs of Staff for policy and plans, there wasnothing Which specifically related to "build-up" material of the kind inquestion. If by any chance thererore, something went wrong, it seemed tome that it would be impossible for iny Director General to take cover eitherbehindthetermsofthisCharterorbehindDrewhimself.Dhadbeenreinforcedin this view by a conve sation I had had with Patrick Reilly, who was apparentlyunder the impression that the security clearance af all information rested withthe Security Service. In Iny view, therefore, it seemed desirable that weshould have something in writing which would leave no room Tor doubt about ourposition.TI then told Drew that in reading the files from the point of view of ourown agent, certain points had occurred to me which seemed to affect intelligenceas a whole. There was a good deal about the structure of the whole intelligencenechine. its procedure, and its chain of command. In addition, there vere anumber of points which, from fairly continuous attendance at J.I.C. meetings,T knew to be highly classified by the Directors of Intelligence from the pointof view of security. In this connection, I instanced the discussions of theChiefs of Staff, the composition of the J.I.C., and the references to ourrelations with Sweden and Finland. I wondered, therefore, whether Reilly, whohad considerable responsibillities for the intelligence machine as a whole, hadgiven his approval.Drew said that he had this point well in mind; thet the documents had beenpassed by Clutton of the Foreign Office, and that he had spoken to Searight of theJ.I.C. Secretariat. telling him that if matters came to the point he woulld bedumping the files on the latter's desk for J.I.C. clearance. He did not,however. want them to become a matter for discussion in the J .I.C. itself.otherwise he would never get anything approved at all. He said that he was underthe impression that a decision had been reached not to pass over the files aboutSweden and Finland. He could not ve quite sure of thisin and he admitted thathe personally had not read every word in the files.60.Drew agreed that we should discuss the points I had raised withReilly, and I am arranging to do this as soon as possible.James Robertson and Simkins came to discuss vith me the passingover of documents in the SHAG case. 23 I mas anxious before seeingReilly to know what B.2'8 views were about handing over the documentsat all.They said that as things stnod at the moment they thought that itwould certainly be preferable to stall on handing over tothe files held personally by STIGMA. This they thought could plausibly bedone on the grounds thet if by any chance something went wrong theleakage would be definitely traceable to STIGMLA himself.T have made an appointment to see Reilly at 11 a.m. on Friday next.Wood of the Home Office rang up to-day to say that, through FranklintheDeputy Under-Secretary he had obtained clearance from the Ministryof Agriculture for the employment of NUNN MAAY in one of the agriculturalestablishments.Franklin had apparently consulted Sir William Slater, Secretary ofthe Agriculturc] Research Council, who, while agreeing in principle,had suggested that possibly other places might be more suitable thanRothamsted, In this connection, he mentioned Long Ashton, near Bristol,where certain experimental world is going on in connection with radio-activeelements in so1l. There is also some other establishment in Scotland.I told Wood that I was seeing the Chairman of Rothamsted to-morrowand also the Chairman of the Agricultural Research Council, when I wouldlet him lmnov the results of my conversations.Wood mentioned, incidentally, that if NUNN MAY' appointment to anyofthese agricultural establishments became known and was the subject ofcriticism in the House, the Government would be prepared to say that theappointment had their approval and support,THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDNDEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION25th March.(4) OF THE PUBLIO RECORDSACT 1968 Mavch 2010T saw Victor Rothschild, Chairman of the Agricultural ResearchCouncil, today and told him of the proposal that NUNN MAY should be givenemployment at Rothamsted. As I surmised, he had already heard of thisproposal thorough the approach that had been made to Sir William Slater,Secretary to the A.R.C. He seemed a little doubtful whether Rothamstedwould give NUMN MAY the outlet that he required, It was possible,however, that there were other places there agricultural research isbeing conducted which might be more suitable. He did not feel that hecould express any definite opinion about this until he lmew preciselythe nature of NUNI MAY's qualifications. tIt vas therefore agreed thathe would consult Sir william Bragg on this point and communicate with mefurther. Meanwhile, E would inform Willlie Radnor, the Chairman ofRothamsted of our conversation and ask him not to proceed further untilltI ese particulars had been obtained.61.I lunched with Willie Radnor and gave him an, account of myconversation with Victor Rothschild.

Ambassador to Siam,attended the meeting. When he gave a talk on the general situation.He said that when he went to Siam he had a dual mission: (a) toprevent Siam from becoming a jumping-off ground for Soviet orChinese Communist imperialism, and (b) to buy rice.The Ambassador thought it might be helpful to the Dommittee if hefirst gave a brief sketch of the position in Siam as he saw it.62.Siam vIaS as big as France with a popullation of 18,000.000of which 3,000,000 wene Chinese. It nad a budget rughly thesize of that of the L.C.C.The Siamese vere the Sianese werethe biggest rice producers in the world; they hed always beenwell fed and their standards of living were improving. The factthat they had never been subjected to Colonial rule caused them to befree from any inferiority complex and gave no basis for Cormnistpropaganda of the kind directed against Colonial peoples. The Siameseindividual had no real interest in politics; in fact his general tendencywas to avoid being a, politician. Mhe people vere traditionally andhonestly Monarchist.The ordinary peasant in the country lnev about theKing, but many of them might never have heard about Pibuhl. Ontheother hand, they Inew about General Pao beeause his policemnan waspresent in their village. Generally speaking, the Siamese werefatalistic in outlook, a characteristic which in fact formed partof their religion.The relations between the Chinese individual and the Thaiindividual were good, and there was a considerable amount of inter-marniage. but as a bloc the Chinese were feared. This was not afear of Corrmunism, but a fear of China as a powerful State.The Government could beet be described as a lot of sel-seelingguniin with sharp rivalries between indivdual leadens. Althoughthis situation created political instability, it Was not as bad asitmight seem. Pibuhl was a strong man, and probably the only manto run the country; there did not seem to be any altermeiivepresent regime.THIIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDApart from Pibuhl there were three prominent figures: PARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS(i) Generall Serit, who cormands the troops in Bangbk958 Havch 2010.he is rarely Sobar, bu't appears to have the gift ofleadership in addition to considerable business acumen..(ii)General Wrong for Wong) Comnandr n-in-Chief of the AirForce and also Minister of Corunications.(iii) General Phao, Director General of Police and Deputy Ministerof the Interior. In addition to his official duties he ovmedthe biggest financial house in Siam, which is pun almost entirelyby Chinese. He was regarded as a somewhat sinister figure.Linison with the Police on the frontier at a Low Level worked well,but General Phao, for reasons best known to himself did not seem to takethe Chinese Conununist inenace very seriously. The Ambassador had had atwo-hour rnversation With him just before leaving, but had not been albleto make much headway. The courses which S.I.F.E. were giving to thePolice vrere, in the Ambassador opinion, a good thing, allthough hedoubted whether on their return the students would got much encouragemnentfrom General Phao.The Ambassador said that the wealth of the country viaS certainly onthe increase, bu't that mch of it vent into the pockets of Ministens.he development of the countoy' resources vaS going ahead, bu't woullacertainly move faster if a11 the taxes collected were put to their properuse,63.The Siamese Navy, such as it was, seerned to be reasonably good;two of its frigates had given a good account of themselves in Korea.The Air Force was not at all bad and had produced good pilots, althoughthey had not been tried out in combat. The Army aimed at having nineBrigade Combat Teams; they were equipped with tanks and small arms butvere short of artillery. They were being trained by the Americans, whofound them receptive.The Ambassador did not think that Siam would fold up if the Vietminhsucceeded in capturing Tonking. They would, however, be seriously worried.He thought that the will to resist had increased very considerably since hefirst went to Siam and that. with American assistance in training andequipment, Siam could be converted into a bastion against Chinese Gommnistaggression. For this reason he was anxious that as much as possibleshould be d.one to exchange information and to improve Service contacts.Just before he left he and Malcolm MacDonald had had an interview with theSiamese Foreign Minister. when a definite request had been made for StafEtalks.The D.N.I made the following points on his visit to the UnitedStates:a) The U.S. Air Force maintain, partly, it is believed forpolitical reasons, that for the next few years the U.S.A.would be Russia' principal target in the event of war.This view is not wholly shared by the Army and the Navy.In the long term a good deal of thought is being given tothe question of Russian potential versus American potentiall.b) The Canadians are being pushed more and mnore by the Americansto increase their northern defences, and the Canadians may findit difficult to meet both this commitment and their Europeancormitment.c) The Americans seem to be coming round to the view that there isno immediate military solution to the stalemate in Korea, and thatthe only long-term policy is to try and drive a wedge etween theChinese and the Russians - in other words, they are apnroximatingmore to the British point of view.At the Appointments Board meeting to-day I stated that a suggestionhad been made thatClerk in Defnece Security office,Cyorus, should visit Lond.on for a course of instruction. No decisionon this proposal was reached and the Board agreed to circulate the papersand take the matter at next week' S meeting.information I about Woburn Abbey as an evacuation premises in order thatstated that I was most anxious that we should obtain all possiblean early decision might be taken.

Cucimeyin the Canal Zone. There was a general discussion on relations withS.I.S. and the Board felt that at the moment ve could not raise anyobjection to these proposals.We had a rather useful discussion about the present trend in S.I.S.We felt, therefore,that on British or Commonwealth territory we should tale a firm lineabout doing our own job, and. that on foreign territory we should maintainthe right either to establish an officer OP to have free access to ouropposite numbers. More often than not the latter procedure was the mostsatisfactory and the least expensive. If it can be properly establisheda certain amount of the need for integration would disappear. Integrationhes probably been a necessary step in establishing confidence betweenourselves and S.I.S. and in getting them to disclose their sources ofinformation from foreign territory in which we have an interest. Suchdisclosures would have to go on but there is clearly a tendeney amongstcertain senior officers in S.T.S. to feel thet their participation inthe preparation of memoranda, such as those produced by S.I.M.E I. and S.I.F.

At moat, therefore,PEARSON was an unconseious agent. but considerable allowances had to bemade for Elizabeth BENTLEY' imaginntion, which was increasing now thatshe had mun out of factual information.George gave two reasons or the Americans opposing like PEARSONas Secretary General for U.N.O.; firstly. that they might wish him totake the post but fear that if they supported him Russia would opposehim or secondly, that they resented his outspoken remarks about the U.S.A.and therefore did not vant him as candidate.31st Manch.George MeClellan came to say good-hyeHe is off to Canadato-night.Brigadier Hirsch rang up about am article which hae appeared inde COURCY'!

An amnesty for those serving sentences ofless than five years has been declared, although there ane reservations,particularly in the case of counter-revolutinnariee Apart fromthisthere are to be reductions in the price of food and manufactured goods.All this seems to suggest that the present regime feel it necessaryto rally the population around them. It also shows that there must havebeen disagreement with Stalin only so long as he was alive no-one daredto resist him. It may well. be an indication that the Russians haverealised that their action against the Jews has done them a considerableamount of harm abroad,Thess internal measures are coupled with a considerable show ofcomparative cordiality in foreign relations, which is viewed with somescepticism by the Western world.

T made four points:L.The function mentioned in the corents of the Director of SecurityB.I.0.G. on the report of the delegation, i.e. to investigate espionagecases in detail and to bring the case of a conclusion by either causingarrest of the suspect, passing the case at a given state to the BEVfor such action as the BiV can take, merely recording the case foraction on a more suitable future occasion or abandoning the casecomplletely, would clearly have to be performed by somebody.or by Section 3 from its own resources, or by Section 3 in conjunctionwith the German authorities. It seemed to me that the last methodwould be the most appropriate; the case would then be properly recorded inthe archives of C.R.I.2.The records of would have to be kept allive if they veregoing to be of any value for the purposes of vetting. This would meanthat interrogation reports fron Section I, censorship reports fromSection 2:and reports onRight Wing movements would have to be carried. in C.R I. These recordswould be drawn on not only b* Section 3 for the purposss of vetting, butwould have to be available for ennuinics by our Allies, the Germans, andother Departments, in the same may that the records of LA.E were usedin London. This woulld not merely imply a routine lnok-up. bu't a properassessment of the information in the files and probably further enquiriesthrough the B.T.V. and its counterparts in the Lander.3. If Section 3 was responsible for assisting the Germans in thestructure and development of the B.E.V. and .Vs, it would inevitablybecome the channel for commnication between the Germans and Alliedorganisations and would have to aot cn the basis of a fairly Tullknowledge of what was going on in the British Zone.4.IC the "help and guidance"l referred to in para, 98 of the Delegation'sreport is to be given, it would have to be done on the basis of a fullknovledge of Intelligence in the Zone and would probably need an expertto visit an installation in onder that he could give advice on suitableprotective security measures.For all the above reasons, it seemed that Section 3 of the organisationwould have to be considerably strengthened,The Chairman felt that in the light of the above and the generalmisgivings of the Corittee about the proposals o1 the Delegation onthe security side, a Working Panty consisting of .I.5, M.I.6, theSecurity Division of a Service representative. and a representativof the High Comissionerte office, should loole into the matter in greaterdetail and make recommendations.

Maxch 20l0There was another point which I felt important, namely, that if wecontemplated putting in more people into Special Branch, we should beconfident tha't they would be in a position to make their entrance felt.IE there was a deadweight on Malayan policemen on top of them this mightnot be the case.Lcighkov is due back on May 6th and ye might vell wait to hear whathe has to say, Meanwhile I would make a very tentative suggestion onthe above lines at the J.I.0. on Thursday.We subsequently discussed this with D.C. and D.0.8., who vere inagreement.here was nothing that really concerned us at the L.S.I.B. meetingco-day, except a definition by the Junior Board of those categories withinthe organisation of SIGINE who should be subjected to positive vetting.T told the Committee that the matter o:f positive vetting for alltopsecret categories was under discussion, and that whille we were in general73.agreement to exercise that far something greater control of the kind for what was necessary, really was top it woul.d secret. be essential Certainlythe Air Ministry, and I think most other members of the Board, were infavour of positive vetting for 811 integrated personnel, and there wasstrong feeling by the Chairman that perhaps all these people should beas drastically reduced as possible. He congratulated the Security Serviceon having effected a small reduction on their figure which is now downto 169. The Air Ministry figure is the highest at about 560.15th April,The D G. returned to-day from Kenya, He seerned wel.l satiisfied withthe progress that had been made in dealing with the MAU MAU.

Bucks, called in to see me to-day.I attended the Appointments Boand which was considering the D.G'ssuccessor. Bridges was in the Chain, the other members of the Boand beingStrang, Newsam, Harold Parker, General Brownjohn, Brook, and a representaof the Civil Service Commission. Bridges took me through my curriculumvitae, when T explained various appointments that had held. He thenasked. me what Qualifications I thought were appropriate for the Directorof this Service. I said that while this was a little difficult for meto answer, I felt strongly that somebody was needed who had a fairlyintimate lnowledge of the vorkings of the machine. Whille one expeetedideas to germinate in all stratas of the organisation, it was necessaryfor the head to do quite a lot of thinking on the subject, particularlyin the direction of improving our methods of obtaining information.Strang asked me about our foreig relations. T explained how weme't our opposite mumbers in Europe in the S..C. every three months. andhow vre had facilities to go over and discuss matters with them when casesof mutual interest arose. I also explained our rellations with theDominions and the extent of out organisation overseas.Newsam suggested to me that mos't of out information came from thePolice. I said that this waa a complete misconception; that the bulkof the information was obtained fram our own sources, and that it waswe who were directing the Police to Pill in the gaps or to make specialenquiries in regand to particular cases. He then asked me whether T didnot think the most important function of the D.G. was not in the ehoosingof staff. I said that it was an extremely important function, but Tthought that we had a good statf and that we had been recruiting the rightsort of people. T might, off course, have said that the D.G. has onlyattended one Appointments Board in the last Six years, but T felt thatthis was rather too personal!Norman Brool asked me about languages. I said that I had found Fmenchand German very valuable to me in the days when I had a good deal o:f it toread, and that it vas, of course, extremely use:ful when discussing mattens75.16th April.At the J.I.C. to-day, Stevart Secretary of the J. J.I.C. I. F.E. E.was present. when a number of points were discussed for the improvementof Far Eastern Intelligence.I told the Committee that we were prepared to explore whether itwas possible to give General Templer any further assistance. There wasquite a long discussion about Hong Iong. The upshot was a recoinmendationthat the L.I.C. should be left as it is to deal with internal securitymatters, but that another erCommittee chaired by the nev Political Adviser,should be set up to co-ordinate efforts to obtain information from China.Representation would in most cases be identical with tha't of the L.I.C.Eric Jones aslred me for guidance in replying to a letter from theSoviet Air Attache, inviting him to attend the showing of a film at theSoviet Embassy. They had addressed him as "Group-Captain" Jones at anaddress Which he first occupied in August 1916, but leet six monthsago. It is a little difficult to see hov they got his private address.I said that I would look into the matter and advise him.The LUBZINSKY case hes been under investigation as a joint operationwith the French Surete. LUBZINSKY of EM.I. waB seen as well as hisrelative in Paris. In neither case have we got very far.While LUBZINSICY of E.M.I admitteat thet the faets seem to fithimself he could give no satisfactory explanation.

Morch 2010The77.information from Cyprus wais not very satisfactory oving to the Leck of aSnecial Branch. Muller had recommended that on should be set u, but theLegislative Council had turned it down, and Ashinore, the Commissioner ofPolice was at ever, one Inev, apathetic.Relations between the mnanagament of S,T.N.E. and J.I.D. had muchimproved since the departure ofsince lethered, beinga Security Service man, Was less inclined towards separatist tendencies.J.I.D had previously rather taken the line that they were a 1aw untothemselves, and tha't enguinie about thei work from the management ofS.I.M.E. was something of an interference.Oughton referred briefly to his roVr withwhich hethought was particularly childish. He hed merely expressed the view thatbefore rejecting a proposal for co-operation with the Abyssinians on counter-intelligence matter, the Head of S.I.M.E. should have been consulted, Howev Ythis matter ned subsequently been regulated.On the question of the post in Aden, Cughton was clearly open toargument and I think he appreciatted that such work as waS required in Aden.rgeisha and Mhartoum could just as well have been eondueted by visitingofficer from S.I.1.. aE by the establishment of & new poat.Oughton had been asked by Stephens to elucidate contain Toints in regardto Stephens' new appointment to C.4. There was evidently a slight Feelingthat we were not satisfied with the running S Stephens, moreover,wondered Whether the Job vas going to give hiin ennugh scope and whether itwas his final job in the office. He would clearly like to feel that hewould be given another opportunity of serving abroad, possibly 38 Heed ofS.I.5 E. He prefers service abroad to service at home. and T think realisesthat he is not an easy person to fit into Head Office. He is. however, asolader and will do What he is told. I tola Oushton that C.4 with itsPort end Travel Control Group, is quite a big job and thought it wouldgive Stephens the scope he wanted. It would not necessarily preclude thepossibility of his serving another term abroad.Cughton thought that Cuclmey' unit had been built up to a satisfactoryposition, and that it was obtaining reasonably good information.22nd April.At to-day's J.I.C. ve discussed a paper on German activities abroad.There is some anxiety about what they are doing in Egypt, particularly inview of reports that some of the late Nasis are training the Egryotiansin guerilla activities. Snealing in general, T said that what they were dotingnow WaS in a way somewhat similar to their activities arter the First worldvar.

It vas difficult to understand whyhad been asked, since in the papers to be discussed we vere not ineludedas inembers, nor were ve put down as recipients of papers. It seemed to methat we should be Tull members by virtue of the fact that the resources ofthe research laboratory at Dollis Hill were to be Dut into the general pool.We hac set UD this research laboratory and obtained the necessary fundsfrom the Treasury.

He did not seem particularly satisfied with hisintervie and was anxdnus that nothing should be said about his applicationFor the post. I might well have relied that there had been a good deal in tlPress, and that report had reached us From Washington months ago that hisappointment was a fait accompli. Certainly members of his staff know allabout it, and in fact McEwan had told me that he was very elated about hisspects of success before the interviev. T said that the difficulty wasthat, with the exception of Norman Brook, none of those present had theslighest idea of what the Security Service did.I attended the Brundrett Committee, when apologies were tendered to usfor not having included us in the membership of the Committee. his yas tosome extent due to their being no very specific direction from the Chieis ofStaff.

While he thinks that the paper maybe running at a loss of anything up to 1,000 a week, it will always bedifficult to compute the exac't amount and in particular the sources fromwhich it comes. He thinks, however, that it may derive Crom certaininvestments which have been made in the past and also from a number ofwealthy well-wishers. It may be, therefore, that no actual. remissionof funds from abroad is really necessary to keen the Commnist Partyand its Press going.

Nevertheless, it VICES possible at somefuture date that they might be given, by gradunl degrees, some measure ofself-government under the Federation. Huggins could. no't say anythingabout this even if he had io in mind without meeting with violen't oppositionfrom the white Dopulation.

In eveny case where toouble had arisen 1 wasalmost invariably due to a bad S.B organisation. TE the Inspectorate ofce in the Colonial Cifice had any nuncti n at a11, it should be able toput this right, This was not to say that our S.L.0. could not provideassistance on the basis of our experience, but it was difnicul.it to see howwe could go beyond this point without taking 0ull responsibility for securityin the Colonies. This would nean that ve should have to tale over the S.B.or create an .1.5 in the Colony, Personnlly I could not feel that thiswas either nOSSible or desirablle.I went Over to Are Pstricl Dean, He promised to endeavour to obtainauthority as soon as possible.

Mardh 2010At the D.G'e meeting we discussed the Cour promotions to Sendor Officer.D explained out process of reasoning and the many difficulties we hndencountered in regard to officerrt who joined us during the WaT, either inuniform or on attachment. the list that had been published about two yearsago had undoubtedly created misgivings in many peoples! minds since it Seemedto operate untairly against those v/ho had given long and loyal service butwere downgraded in the senionity list because. through 110 Caullt o their own,they hed been in uniform. Tt was tor this reason that ve had decided toput all those who hed joined us after the beginning of the Wam to singledate -- 1.1.16. We had then considered the names of la'ter seniority than1.1.16 in Case there wene any Srecinl cases which menitea cinsideratinn.thepnly one in this category had been SHARDON, wet in fact joined us in 1910 andmht ht well have argued the had he Been asiced to stay on at the end of the varhe would have been pleased to do so. His case differed somewhat from thatofHaldanePorter,whoohisowvolitionleftusattheendauthevarinthehope 0r making career dor himself in the Foreign office. IT Was only whenhe found that he could not get in thrugh the foreign Price bacle door that hecame bach to uB. Another difficult case that of Ronnie Reed.. who WIS87.attached to us from the B.B.C., later became established, and wasfinally pu't into uniform to do a job on the second front. It mightbe possiblle to review al3. these names again and in each case arrive atsome arbitarg date, but the issue was further clouded by a decision Ofthe late D.G. that although officers in uniform should, for thepurposes of pension, be Eiven half their period of service, those whoremained 18 civilians should calculatte their pensions ro the date ofjoining, We ad,however, considered all these names primailly ongrounds of maenit and experience, age had allso been a considerationand seniority.It was clear here that there was a fandamental differencebetween ounsellves and the D.G, who felt that seniority was the primaryconsideration -e- T think on the grounds that once a man had been passedover he vas no longer eligible for promotion. Prior to this Dickhad urged the D.G to leave these promotions until after the projeetedreorganisation on a 3-Divipional basis had ttaken place.The D.G clearly ddd not like the four names we had put forward,He said tha't he would review them with D.E/A. and we understood thatthe whole matter would be reconsidered at a further meeting, Therewas then a discussion about making further promotions to Senior Officergrade, bu't no decision was reached.I saV Sir William Slater to-day. He will be seeing the head ofthe Macaulay Institute this weel and will discuss with him the proposalltha't NUNN MAY should be given appropriate work at the Institute.

T saidthet we were opooged to this because We believed that the cases would appearsomewhat thin and Odecreditoble to British justice. The reasons forthis were two-fold firstly. secret evidence which left no doubt aboutthe individuals guilt could not be produced in Court and secondly, asthe cases were judged in the atmosphere of the time, when both Judge and Juegmight have show some bias. Newsam said that he appreciated these pointsbut that his task in dealing wi.th Lond Jovett was mede extremely difficultowing to the P.M. having published details about the Tyler KENT case inhis book; he would, however, do what he could and would certainly ensurethat the manuseripts were submitted for censorship before publication.Before I left Newsam said that he was sorry that it had taken SOlong to reach a decision about the D.G's successor. It had been a matterof getting Ministers together, but he hoped that the matter would be settledabout the middle or end OT next weelc.Skendon told me that he had seen NUNN MAY, who had appllied Tom areseanch job at Campriage with some Company, but that a good manypreliminary negotiations would hae to talte place before any decision wasreached.

At the same timethere were many defec'ts i.n the Special Branch echine: the reconds were ina bad state and there was litile chance of getting them right until theemengenoy was over. The reports were coming in in considerable quanbibiesand the names written in Chinese were linked up in a rather ad hoc way byChinamen within the Special Branch. They were the only neonle who coulddo this work and they seemed to do it with reasonable efficiency and fairsecurity. A research group had been formed in which Carrel was vorling,and when their picture was complete the names were canded according to anAmerican system and the report considered from the point of view ofpenetration. He instanced a particularly good report on the agitprop:departmentoftheM.C.P.Theyhadlocatedtheleaderofthisparty,whowas a member oi the Executive, and steps veme being talen to get an agentin alongside him.

He put this down to the factthet virtually no information was coming out of China.
