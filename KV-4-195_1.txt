KVI4/19581, 211, 250,290.Ilst September 1944.I had a talk with J.C. and warriott about thefu'ture of B.1 agents. In principle I thoughtwe should not be in any hurry to liquidate theorganisation but that that it should take itsnatural course in accordance with the variouscharacters of the agents. Our rincipat objec-tive would be to maintain touch with such agenk,of the Abwehr or S.D. that remainwhether in Germany or abroad. I did notimagine that there would be any attempt atespionabe in the ordinary sense either by theAbwehr or SD until there is some properlyconstituted government in Germany with acertain amount of freedome of action. UnlessGermany is allowed a limited quantity pfarms or control becomes so lax thit t she isable to make or acquire them clandestinely,there is no point in her having details ofour latest devices. She may however beafter industrial seerets. The main objectiveof those working for the regeneration of Germanyand a 3rd world war will be to get themseivesback into power. Their activities. vill there-fore be concentrated on propaganda for amodification of the armistice terms andfor the removal of foreign armed forces fromGerman territory. This will be conductedthrough clubs, associations and individuals.,some conscious and some unconseious of whatthey are doing. The line will prob bly be thefamiliar one: ta) you can't keep agreat nationdown; b) Germany's regeneration is in theinterests of Europe; (c) an unstable Germanyleads to trade dislocation; (d) money spent onCatalogue Reference:KVI4/195occupying troops in Germany could be be tterspent on social services in this countryi(ethe re 1 menace is Russia and we should combinewith Germany against her. It is possible thatthe Germans may resort to guerilla tacticsdirected against those ho assist the alliedauthorities and also ressileby against theallied authorities themselves. It willtherefore be valuable if we can establish somelink with these parties either in Germanyor outside. GARBO may perhaps be able tocontribute something in this direction. Asregards the Japs there is the possibility thatwhen the war in the west is over and facilitiesfor travel are relaxed, they may attempt topick up information from this country. Person-ally I am doubtful and even if they do thereis little tha they could obtain that they couldput to good account before they ire forced tocapitulate. I think however that Ne shouldmaintain such contacts with them as we can, asan insurance against eirbuiiding up anysort of network in this country.Harker called a meeting with Charles, Harry,Richard Butler and myself to discuss ourcommitments in the Far East. it was generallyagreed that Stratton's visit was unnecessaryand that the situation as regards port securitycould be handled by tim Airy and Patterson.Caulfeild will recommend to the theDNI that heshould send no reply until the D.G. has had anopportunity of considering the matter.

It is quite hopeless to tryand get a car. Q Movements or wihoever is concernewould have to open at least 6 files and the carwould not get to France until about 1950.There may be a chance of getting Tess off -throughSIS. I have spoken to Kim about this.C. rang me up rather alarmed because DerekMorley had been round talking oThis-professorJones about the U-bomb. L said that neitherI nor TAR had had an consultitions with thecontroller on this subject. It seemed to mejust possible that the controller might have hearof it through C'Conror since ne would -probablybe aware of the questionn ire to be put by theGermans to the agentwho is being runby tae FBI. C. said that V.2. micht conceivablge into operation in south Jutland owhenge henad had two reports. We discussed also theprobablye reactions of fanatic il Nazis in GermanyCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1S5after the armistice. I told him that in myview the job of CCMS would be very largelya police job requiring fully qualified interro-gators who would have to deal ith denuneiationsetc. I mentioned to him that L had spoken toHoover about this. was quite sure that heought to be represented on the American CCMS.C. said he Nould bear this in mind and try toput in a word ith the Americans. He agreed vithme that neither G.2 2 nor OSS could possiblycarry the task.I went to see Lamplough, who is DMI SEAC, inorder to find out from him whether he waslooking to us for any assistance on the CI side.e came to the conclusion that on the whole itwas doubtful whethee Ne should make much of acontribution although it as possible that wecould sell something on methods of control inthe field. We both agreed that in so fir asport security was concerned we had a definitepart to play. Lamplough thought it might beuseful if S mebody could go out and take alook at their CI organisatien in the light ofexperience in France. L should have thoughtthat if he could be spared Niall MacDermotwuld have een ideal for the job.The war seems to be going extremely vell. TheAmericans re in Verdun and we are steeakingahead north of Amiens. There does not a pe rto be much resistance.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/195bSeptember 2ndWilson has put up two very interesting reportsbased on information that he h s received fromDRE CADNOUGHT. They throw a particularly inter-esting light on the attitude of MIHAILOVIC.If DREADNOUGHT'S appreciation is correct,MIHAILOVIC is really doing what 1e considersto be best for his country as distinct rom theallied cause. He dislikes both the Germansand the Partisans. had ollaborated withthe Germans for two purposes: 1. to get greaterfreedom of mevementand eontrol over certainareas of the country, and 2. to get arms. Hehas not so far been in a sufficiently dominat-ing position to come out into the open and dealwith both Germans and Fartis ns, nd continueshis collaboration with the Germans in the hopethat he vill, as a reward for his apparentcollaboration, be in a position to obtain suchequipment as they will be forced to leavebehind or be prepared to hand over te him. ASfar as Nedic is concenred, he is playing a some-what similar game, fighting bogus battles inorder that Nedic can have plausible excusesfor losing equipment which comes to MIHILO-VIC's head quarters.DREADNOUGHT'S On efforts vere concentrated oneconomic sabotage, i e. in preventing the Germansfrom getting raw materials and anufaetured goodsby devious eans, and seeing th.t if they did getthem they were likely to be defective in one wayor another. He has givena long account of hisassociation With Artist which tallies in almostevery detail with reports se nave already receiv-CatalogueReference.KV/4/195 le case he said that1neither Munzinger nor Wiegand had ever expressedany doubts about Tricycle, but Dreadnoughtsaid that Abt.3 had raised two points as castingdoubts on the bon fides of Tricycle. Thefirst was that after Tricycle nad visited RiOalmost the entire German 1.S. in Brazil hadbeen arrested (Tricycle had in fact not beenresponsible for this). The other was that atsome time during the early stages of the caseT'ricycle had had some knowledge of anotherGerman agent in London, and the latter hadbroken down. Unfortunately Dreadnought cannotamplify this statement which might resumablyrefer to Giraffe, Tate or Balloon. Munzinger'sopinion on these points was that if you lookedonly at them it was possible to arguethatTricycle was controlle but to do SO was toignore hundreds of other thingaspinting tothe fact that he was not. Wiegand's opinionwas that when Tricycle's last report had beenvetted they would see whether Tricycle waseontrolled or not and in faet after the vettingthey were completely satisfied.They were also completely satisfied with thewireless messages that Freak was sendingwhile Tricycle was in Lisbon. After Dread-nought had returned to Belgrade, Sensburg came aand asked him for some details about Freak.(This would probably be during the second halfof May or early June 1944 it was about thistime that the Germans interceptedd a messagefrom Mihailovic to his DMI about Freak's bonafides, which was relayed to Berlin). Dreadnoughtwas cunous to know why Sensburg was askingabout Freak and tried to find out through ToplakTaplak eataisgerseterenBagkv/9ngre reported back to Dreadnought that Sens-burg had said that there was a slight possibilitythat the English had grounds for suspectingFreak. Toplak had asked Sensburg if he thoughtthat there was a suspicion that Freak was controlled and Sensburg had denied this and said:"God help us all if Freak goes bad. We willall lose our heads".Dreadnought's explanation of the lack ofinterest shown by the Germans in the reportsof the Worm and Meteor is that both wereregarded primarily as Munzinger's men and whenM. lost his job in 1943 nobody was interestedin try ing to run his cases successfully.On the 28th August the Jap Govt. informed theGerman mbassador that the Supreme Council feltthat the war situation was very serious. Thingswere going badly on all fronts and a restora-tion of the balance of fighting power to whichthe Germans were looking could not be expectedto materialise at any rate for some time. Mean-while on the diplomatic front Germany wasgradually being encircled through the defectionof her allies. In such circumstances was itwise of Germany to try to put an end to thewar by force alone. Germany should thereforetry and reach a compromise peace with the USSR.The Japanese would be prepared to intervene withthe USSR in this sense but would prefer theGermans to make direct negotiations.Ronnie Haylor has put up a draft agreement toSIS on the respective work of Section V andCCMS in Germany. de assumes that SIS will besetting up its own independent network and thatSection V will wish to have a long-term organ-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/195isation for CI purposes. This will not be theconcern of CI branch of the CCMS except in SOfar as the branch will wish to receive the pro-duct of SIS work whenever this is relevant toimmediate CI activities in Germany. The CIwill need to keep a very close watch on allaspects of German life, and the Public Safetysection of the Control Commission will usemany informants for this purpose and willultimately be largely responsible for whatmay be termed overt enquiries. It will alsobe responsible for covert enquiries by agentsto supplement the information obtained by SIS.This will have the advantage that a widespreadnetwork of minor agents can be maintained indat the same time A higher grade (?and long-term)agents of Section V will thereby receiveadditional cover. This I gather has been rathera bitter pill for Felix but Kim thinks itquite,sound.September 4thOur casualities,including those af the Americansand Canadians on the 30th August were roughly198,00 of which 38,000 were killed. The totanumber of German prisoners taken was 193,000.The latest reports indicate that we are inHntwerp. This means that all the main railwaysfrom the Pas de Calais.back to Germany are cut.There are elements of some 25 German divisionsbet een us and the Channel Ports.

It is said that some of ourarmoured Catalogue gudiefeiencehavarpggen ance:haya/pspe dropped in the10Belfort gap. algiers radio states that we havetaken Calais and Le Treport. The Russians havepushed on well beyond Bucharest and Finlandhas requested all Germans to leave her territoryby September 15th. tltogether things seem tobe going pretty well.On the 9th August a large amount of allied sab-otage equipment which had been dropped by para-chute was captured at the SD and SIPO head-quarters at Rennes. A German who was inter-viewed stated that the Rennes headquarters hadcontained the best collection of sabotage materi-al in the Brittany peninsula. All suspiciousbjects dropped by parachute and captured fromresistance organisations were brought to Rennesfor examination. A further attack by the KDKtook place off Normandy on August 3rd and al-though acertain amount of damage was causedincluding the sinking of HMS Quorn, the enemylost at least 20 explosive motorboats and 20human torpedoes. T1 further attack took placeon the night of August 16-17th. On both theseoccasions the Germans sent over a few aircraftimmediately prior to the attack in order thatthe light from the British tracer flak andsearchlights should assist the human torpedoesifinding their targets. The Germans had intendedto block the Seine by blowing up some harbournstallations and sinking ships in the river.It is believed that the disorganisation was suchthat they were unable to carry out these plans.Reports from the field show that during the fort-night 12-26th August 9 new cases have beenbrought to 020. They did not add very much toCatalogue ReterEncRvianpg the procedure adoptedJIby stay-behind agents and line-crossers. Thespies themselves come from areas remote fromthe battle which has moved SO fast that visualreece line-crossers have been put out of businessand W/T agents where installed or about to takeup their posts were presumably discouraged fromtheir assignments. But these deductions tellus a little of what may be going on at the front.At least the enemy may have had plans forinstalling more formidable tay-behind agentsin Paris and may do SO in other large centresbefore they are liberated.From the field we learn that sever: l enemy agentshave already been apprehended as a result ofthe rapid circulation of descriptions obtainedfrom the interrogation of agents already in ourhands. A procedure has been adopted wherebyas soon as an enemy agent is broken a tacticalinterrogation is carried out under the directionof the Army C.1. staffs. Headquarters armiesthen immediately destribute the descriptionsof any agents known to the prisoner andbelievedto be at large. Heddauarters 21st army groupdistribute peridically down to C. C.I. sections andprovost commanders a printed list withphotographs, where abailable, of wanted personsbased on ailedminterrogations of agents atArmy Group Interrogation Cage, and informationfrom central agencies. Copies of one or twolists produced by lst and 3rd and U.S. armiesare also distributed on the same scale. Copiesof all these lists go to the Frehch at ArmyGroup - C.I. sections pass necessary detailsone one or two persons to spedial policy intheir area. TheGermans do not appear to takeany trouble to proyide their agents withCatalogue Reference:kV/4/19512elaborate cover stories and have sometimesallowed them to produce their own withoutrehearsal. The obvious stories are: seekingrelatives in liberated territory, escaping fromforced labour, desire to join the allies,avoiding of charges of black marketting, andex-Todt workers. A better effort was theobtaining of a forged letter from a resistanceleader. Some agents have succeeded in makingthemselves believed at least by their firstnterrogators. An old confidence trick isalso being tried in which the agent attemptsto bluff his interrogator by admittingthat he has been in contact with the J.I.S. anddenying that he has accepted. The Germans havemade such elementary mistakes as to allowmore than one agent to carry identical articles,e.g. pastry in Jam jars, loose buscuits, calvadosGreen Gauloise cigarettes, false identitycards with par'ticulars written in German hand-writing and ration coupons with issuing stampsbadly smudged to obliterate their origin. Theenemy is now giving to allied P/W immediatelyupon capture a postcard called Siegfried FrontLone Service. One side of the card providesfor a personal message. The other has spacefor the address. The address required isthat of the company,battalio regiment or armypost office address After the cards have beenfilled in they are fired back by rifle grenadeor other means to the British lines. The induce-ment held up to the P/W is the rapid transmissiorof news of capture to his unit and SO to hisfamily. Any quantity of these cards of courseprovides the enemy with our order of battle.I.personnel have been instructed when searchingCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19513houses to do SO in the presence of the occupier,to get a receupt for money and valuables and toseal up the house, placing a note upon it to theeffect that entry is forbidden by the BritishSecurity authorities. If possible a neighbouris asked to keep an eye on the house. Some ofthe British sabotage material found at Rennesconsisted of HE bombs disguised as stones.These are operated by pressure switehes andused as tyre ty re busters. This device can alsobe camouflaged as horse-dung, or various typesof rock or stone. Two of the saboteurs of theChateau Mauberg who were caught were found inpossession of these articles.I saw Courtnay Young this morning about M.T.5report. In my view its style should be changed.I have suggested that we should say somethingabout the D.A. network as a whole, how it isused from the point of view of C.E. and finallydeception.

I told him however thatif I hed anything to do with it it would bedifficult for me to place him over the heads ofHollis or Dick. I quite saw that he had losthis placein the office through no fault ofhis own. Atthe same time Dick and Hollishad been doing the work and it would be diffi-cult to demote them. The probable resultwould be that they would seek a career elsewhere.Curry quite understood this position.

If this came off I could quitesee there might be other fields into which hecould direct his energies.Cnaufurd came to tell me a long story aboutdiamond smuggling and deals in platinum and goldThis had all resulted through a Pole namedSLUBICKI bringing in 32 carats of diamonds tothe DSO Gib. These he said he had received froma BOAC pilot, a Pole named JONIKAS who had 11:atalagutatreferehcekkVtsi9bgeir or Cairo with16instructions to hand them over to another Polishpilot with an unpronounceable name or alter-natively to one DUNKEL, a Polish officer whois apparently working for SOE. SLUBICK'Svisit to the DSO was followed shortly by avisit from DUNKEL whd accused SLUBICKI of havingstolen some of the diamonds out of a brief casedelivered to him. DUNKEL was quite frank aboutthe smuggling and is clearly a very unsatisfac-tory individual. He has been recalled bySOE and is already in this country. "eanwhileSLUBICKI and another Pole have been recalled bythe Polish Mission here S.B. have been drawninto the case which isa highly complicated one.My view at the moment is that the Polishauthorities here who appear to be implicatedalso, will not wish to come clean. Even ifsome of them are not involved they will wish toavoid scandal. DUNKEL will by now have put themwise that something is brewing although theywill not know that SLUBICKI has been to theBritish in Gib.and handed over the Hiamonds.Gur only strong suit is that ve hold the diamondsbut at the moment L am not quite clear how weshould play the hand.September 5thAccording to ISOS Father Was heard for thefirst time on 5.8.44 operating from India.

The Jap Ambassadorin Madrid fears that this may lead to a ruptureof relations between Japan nd Spain. It wouldbe disastrous to the Japs if they lost boththeir stations. The German Minister inSofia was recently in Germany where he hadan interview with Hitler. The Ambassador inform-ed the Japs that Hitler appeared to be extremelycalm and had foreseen from the outset that sucha day as this would dawn. He said that withinthe next 3-5 months the effects of Germany'latest mobilisation would become apparent andthe new weapons would all be in use SO thatGermany would go over to the offensive. Theimmediate necessity was to obtain time and tothis end the shortening of the lines wasinevitable.The latest reports on V.l show that there isevidence that actual launching S are about 10%excess of those recorded by radar.

He told methat while I was away he saw air John Anderson.Andersor is strongly opposed to a completeamalgamation of SIS and ourselves. His reasonsare of course the old political ones. Hethinks that there should be two organisations,an offensive and a defensive, with possiblyan exchange of personnel. He was also quitereceptive to the idea of civil intelligencesections in service ministries to give con-tinuity to the work, but was a little worriedabout how these people could be paid. I hada long discussion with Findlater in which Ioutlined to him what I thought would mikean effective defensive organisation. He seemedto me to be more or less in greement.

There was present a Major Drummondfrom the Army Group who gave us some idea ofthe very complicated set-up. Mountbatten'sDeputy is the American general Stilwell who isin control of British troops, what wereformerly Wingate's troops, Chinese Forces andAmerican Forces, operating in the North EastAsia Command. As far as can see the onlycontrol that Mountbatten has over this force isby virtue of the fact that Stilwell himselfif Mountbatten's deputy. Coming directly underSEAC are C. in. C. Eastern Fleet, who had otherresponsibilities, C. C.on in C.ArmyGroup, comprisingthe 14th Army and Ceylon Army command, and beingalso in some way responsible for G.O.C.Ceylon,Gen. Wetherall. Thirdly the C. in. C. Ceylon,Geoffrey Langton, to whom the Governor of Ceylon,Caldicott, is apparently in some way subordinate,and lastly C.in.C. Air Command, who also hasother responsibilities outside the SEAC area.Itis not surprising that in this extremelycomplex picture there is some confusion as towho is responsible for security in Ceylon.Lexplained to Drummond precisely what we had doneon the Second Front and what the C.I. set-up was.He was very glad to have this information ashe had been extremely confused about the rela-tive functions of I.B.1, and 3 which as Iexplained to him were now S.C.I. S.C.I.,C.I. 2 and C.I.3.He could notquite make out what I.B.l was.Lexplained that this was an SIS unit or as hePrafargee Reference:kvi4/195- to put ISLD unit, that I knewTHIsIsAcopy THISORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETIN DEPARTMENT UNDER3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSthat a party of 20 people under Mou1058toowere going out to the East and that it waspossible although I had no-posstive evidencethat they might be the basis of the SCI unitfor SEAC. I explained how they worked but saidthat in the far eastern-set-l was not veryclear as to what sort of a contribution_t theycould make since they as far as I -knew would nobave any special knowledge of the enemy'intelligence organisation-or-the-appropriatemethods for dealing with it. He then told methat he had already a unit known as Sips(Security ntelligence Planning Section), whichcame into the CI picture. It is-engaged inpreparing lists of suspects and mnteligencetargets. In other words it is performingprecisely-the functions-of-an-SCIuni Itmight be of course thatboyswere going to do something quite different.Ifnot, the only thing they could do would.b be tojoin with Sips and-picktheirbrains Thiswhole question is to be thrashed out at a meetiwith the JIC at which Lamplough, DMI SEAC, andCawlhonne, DMI-India, are to--be presenttold Drummond that while we had planned CIfor the Second Front we had done it on thebasis of our knowledge of the German IS IS-and--of and. of-general CI methods. I did not know how far ourknowleage and experience would be applicabletothe Far Eastern situation. yIt seemed to methat the best contribution to CI therewould beto get an MI5-trained officer who had actuallytaken part in the direction of CI work in thefield. on the Second Front, somebody like NiallcHtaegreqoferencexk4k9s It might be that-hisexperience would be aaluable and that certainmethods employed could be adopted to localconditi ions: Apart from this I Sif not thinkthat we could help very much.

Thetotal sent over is roughly 7, ,800.A German transmitter has piped up from theMunich area wishing to assist the allies andgiving as a reference a certain Mr. Cobden TURNER.This man has been locatedand from particularsg ven, thinks that the transmitter is being runby a German called Lothar ROHDE with whom he hadbusiness talks before the war. He does notaltogether trust ROHDE but the approach may bea genuine one. We checked the identity ofROHDE by asking the German station to give thefirst letter of the maiden name of Turner's wife.The German came back with "F" which is in factcorrect. Her maiden name Wis Fisher. We arekeeping in touch.I saw L. this morning and told him about Plan Z.He was particularly interested because he saidthat he had just got in from SIM in Italyinformtion that they had been inside our Embassyfor years and had bought up all the Italinnstaff. They had been reading all our cyphers.He said that he thought the job we were goingto perform was an important one and would beextremely useful.I then went on to see Vivian. I told him aboutmy visit to Americ and that i had not been ableto intervene on behlf of Evans simply becauseit was cler to me from the general atmospherethat Hoover would not pay more than lip-serviceto any arrangement ith SIS until BSC and allits works were removed. I said that even thenCataleyeetreferencek4aguite a lot of trouble2%in establishing really useful relations withHoover. "or one reason or another he h d gotthe impression that they did not wish toco-operate with him nd that he should never geton to a real basis of frankness. I thenhad to tell Vivian that I found gre it difficultyin discussin this whole problem if he was stillthinking of going back to the status quo afterthe war. I said it was of paramount importantethat Ne should have diract contact with peopllike Hoover, and that somehow or other thiswould have to be achieved. wither Section Vwould have to come to us or we should have togo to them. Vivian seems to have set his faceagainst any such arrangement and it is quiteuseless talking to him on the subject. He isfull of all sorts of rather specious argumentsabout SIS'S responsibilities to the FO whichmake it essentil that they should remain underthe FO as a separate organisation. I said thatI did not see why SIS should be under the FOany more than Ne should be under the HO, andthat it would be far better for both of us to comcome up to the same peak. I felt that the mostsuitable arrangement nould be to put us under theMinistry of Defence in wartime and, and theCID and PM in peace time.I attended a lunch given by the DG for the D.P.P.at which Byrne, Vincent Evans and Paling of hisoffice were present.

He is clearly fora Joint Legislative Assembly with an equalrepresentation for Jew and Arab. He thinks thatif the British Govt. imposed this it would, aftera certain amount of trouble, be accepted bythe majority. Jewish imigration which hefeels has reached saturation point would ofcourse have to cease. The urgent necessity isthat the Govt. should make up their minds andthat some plan should be put through.

He says that if we left the newsto govern Palestine and defend themselves theyveuld be outed by the Arabs within two years.Although Giles did not say SO I gather fromR.J. that he dislikes the Jews. talked withhim about the Anabs.

He told me that recentlyhe had gome into contact with the head of theDanish Resistance Movement. He say S that thismovement is quite powerful politically inDenmark and associated with various otherparties, i cluding the future P.M. it isthe desire of the resistance movements and allthese parties that a close alliance should beformed with Lngland involving the grantingof facilities in certain Danish ports. TheDanes are anxious to make some sort of influ-ential contact here in order that they canget an idea as to whether their proposals arelikely to be acceptable. If they were theywould go to the country as soon as Denmarkis liberated. I told Wibroe to let me havea note giving the names and particulars ofthe various personalities involved and oftheir proposals. I said that r did not think hhe was likely to get any answer at the momentout of the British Govt.b but that they wouldcertainly be interested to hear of the proposalCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19536I told the D.G. about Plan Z and he seemsfairly satisfied, and prepared to leave thingsto me.Sey mer came to see me. He has broken down twoP/Ms one a seaman called McPartland, and theother a commando called Maton. the latteris quite young. He was taken prisoner,segregated in a special camp where he waslectured by Amery,baillie-Stewart and our Oold friend Stranders. He eventually joinedthe British Freikorps. It is not entirelyclear whether the Freikorps was intended togo into the field or whether it was merelyfor propaganda purposes. He was granteda considerable amount of liberty and eventual-ly persuaded to speak on the radiol He admitteall this. after he had been pulled up oncertain details of his previous story. He saysthat he succeeded in getting as far as Brusselswith a lot of German troops, then changedinto civilian clothes and got across the lines.September 9thLast night while was still in the officethere were two explosions in fairly closesuecession about .45. We learn today that twoV.2's have landed, one in epping, which Ido not imagine we could possibly have heard,and one in Chiswick which obviously we didhear. It sounded very much nearer. Probablythe sead report was something in the natureof an echo. In hiswick I believe about 3houses were demolished and 3 people killed.A hole has been made about 16 ft deep and 20 ftCatalogue broad. An eferaninskti9dy1sse to indicate with-37out doubt that the projectile is a rocket.It is believed to have come from Holland.I saw Nevile Bland today and told him thatI knew about his committee which had beendiscussing the affairs of SIS and that Irather wanted to give him my views about thefuture of our own organisation and thepossibility of some form of amalgamation.This I did. I also told him more or less thepart that we had played during the war. Hewas very interested and sympathic and anxiousthat I should get my views about the futureof the office on paper, and that Peter Loxleyshould see them. I told him I had talked toLoxley and that also we were having off therecord discussions with Arnold-Foster. Heagreed that nything in the nature of totalamalgamation was really out of the question.All that the Bland ommittee has done So faris to try and tidy up SIS from within. Theyfeel that assport Control should be cleanedup and that offensive SIS activities shouldtake place under some other cover. Blandseemed to like the idea of an offensive anddefensive organisation and was not apparentlyshocked by the suggestion that we shouldhave some sort of representation abroad.I explained to him exactly why this wasnecessary and why we should be called inon security cases by the Embassies abroad.In particular I mentioned the Ankara case.I also told Bland precisely what we had donefor the Second Front. We then discussedministerial representation. While he feltthat SIS came logically under the FO he wasconvinced that we should both come up to theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/195same peak and did not dissent from my sugees-3tion that both organisations should come underthe Minister of Defence in war and the CID andPM in peace. Over these matters however hewas fairly non-committal. I asked him whetherhis committee had made any positive recomeeda-tion about amalgamation between ourselves andSection V. He said that it hadbeen more orless alluded to and vaguely discussed but ithad not gone farther than this and was reallycompletely in the air. His committee had mmade no recommendation on the subject.He said that he himself did not expect to beleaving for Holland for several weeks,particularly since he had heard that Germantroops were entering Holland.I have spent most of the rest of the day goingthrough in very great detail the Plan Zarrangements. There has been a slight hitchhowever.

To illustrate this he says thaton the night of the invasion a meeting of allDivision Commanders of the 7th army was calledat Rennes to discuss operations in case ofan allied air-borne landing.On the 4th Sept. Hitler had an interview withthe Catalogue Jan Refeener:K/Rgsbentrop. Hitler asked41about the situation in the east said that atthe moment things were very critical in the westSO that he could say nothing definite untilhe saw how things went there. He thoughthowever that Germany would have to fight anotherround with the Soviet armies in the east.Ribbentrop speaking in front of Hitler saidthat if Japan sounded the USSR views aboutpace directly this would be interpreted by theenemy as having been done at the request ofGermany and as revealing her weakness. Hetrusted therefore that this subject would beavoided. The impression given by Hitler wasthat his views regarding victory over the USSRhad undergone a complete change. He made nodenial about Russo-German rapprochment but saidthat at the moment there seemed to be no start-ing point for negotiations. Both Hitler andRibbentrop seemed to agree on this point, andthought any direct attempt would be a sign ofweakness. The Jap Ambassador is therefore ad-vising his government to sound the views of theUSSR in a manner which will not embarrassGermany. Hitler spoke of the attempt on hislife on July 20th. He had been disappointedvy events in the west but indicated that thiswas in part due to confedrates of those respon-sible for the attempt onhis life. This isprobably nonsense and merely an Excusefor the German break-down in the west. Hitlerhowever expressed his intention of liquidatingeveryone who had the slightest connection withthe affair. He said that the British forces'left wing was at present on a continuous frontwhich they had formed and that on the right wingthe Catalogue Americans Reference:KV14 were in 5 or 6 columns whichuwere each composed of 3 or 4 divisions. Hisintentions were to strike at these on the flank;forces were being concentrated S.E. of wancy forthat purpose. He estimated the present strengthof the enemy in N. France as 50 divisions. Hisoffensive would be carried out with the soleobject of stabilising the front. With the mill-ion new troops now being formed togehter withthedetachments withdrawn from various frontsForce Forceetonundertake supported by the take replenishment a great offensive of the in Air thewest, probably in November. the Jap appearedto be Somewhat sceptical about the possibilityof mounting such an operation and still moreas to its success. Hitler expressed hisintention of retreating from the Balkans andGreece and proposed to occupy a line extendingfrom Transy lvania and the southern Carpathiansto the boundary of Yugoslavia to the southwest,but it might be a line westwards from the oldHungarian frontier. In Italy he proposed toretire to the "lps. He could not withdraw hisforces from the Baltic coast since this wouldhave the disadvantage of leaving the Balticentirely exposed to the enemy. Neither couldhe withdraw from Norway O ing to the lossof submarine bases in France He had asbock of the principle raw materials whichwould last him about 2 years.Against a possibleenemy aerial bombardment he would have anti-air-craft units withdrawn from all the various frontIt is somewhat significant that on the 7th Sept.Steengrachts, Ribbentrop's vice-minister madea special approach to the Jap Ambassador. Hehad been instructed to explain that in theirinterviews on the 4th neither Hitler nor Ribben-trop wished to convey the idea that a susso-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19543German separate peace had been turned down flat.The Jap said he had examined every aspect ofthe question in his conversation with H. and R.and thought that he had succeeded in under-standing both of them and that they had inmind. He realised that they were in aposition which precluded their making a definitestatement on a question of this sort. Hehad therefore read between lines and in tele-graphing to his Govt. had added his owninterpretation. This he conveyed to Steen-gracht. The representative of the Jap Ministerof the Interior in Berlin held the vie of 6thSept. that the collapse of Germany was only amatter of time. He therefore proposed to removehimself to Switzerland.The JIC, reviewing the possibilities of attackagainst the UK by airborne and seaborne forcesstate that while the Germans are still inHolland there i5 just a remote risk of attackby one-man torpedoes, explosive motor boatsor 2-man submarines carried by L. boats orlarger craft. When the enemy have been drivenout of Holland the possibility of such attackssouth of the Humber can be ruled out. It isnot thought that the Genan Pavy will in thehour of defeat undertake a suicidal operationagainst targets in the UK. lf they do themost likely targets would be Scapa and thegeneral area of the Firth of Forth.THIS,S A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN 3 (4 DEPARTMENT OF THE PUBLIC UNDER RECORDS SECTIONACT 1958.OV 2800Catalogue Reference:KV/4/195wu3 IN ORIGINAL DEPARTMENT (4 OF THIS THE DOCUMENT IS PUBLIC UNDER A COPY RETAINED SECTIONRECORDSACT 1958.

NOU 0oOMusataldgfe keterecexvarfasions With the JapAmb mbassador ass in Vienna on 22nd ind 28th August.$2Musso was very bitter about the way the Germanswere treating the Italians in N. Italy. Theyhad clearly more or less taken the command notonly of the forces but also of administrativeposts. Their action against any recalcitrantswere extremely drastic. Musso had complainedto the German mbassador but without gettingmuch redress. He thought, the incidents wouldhave a serious effect on Italo-German relations.The Germans were requisitioning all kindsof commodities and means of transport in N.IteThey took food stuffs and live stock, machineimplements, typewriters, handcarts, clocksand even motor-horns. Reprisals againstbanditryand acts of terrorism were extremelysevere and the Germans carried them out indis-criminately, even against party members andGovt. officials. Many innocent people hadsuffered at their hands and there were eveninstances in which women abd children and oldpeople had been locked up in houses and burnedto death. As the reprisal for acts of terrorismin Milan 15 corpses had been left all day inthe public square. Such things excited popularfeeling and furnished the enemy with excellentpropaganda material. It is not surprisingtherefore that the feelings ofthe papulacetowards the Germans had become extremely acute.Under such conditions one could not guaranteethat they would not even rejoice at thearrival of the British and american forces.They had also had their effect on Italian troopswho had been trained in Germany' and were return-ing through .Italy to the front. The existenceof the Italian Govt. and their authority werebecoming a dead letter in the eyes of the peopleevatalogoe Rferenceqvt4/o5or obtaining the53supply of gasoline and other commodities theGermans wish to make a reduction in the italianAir Force which numbers some 20,000. The ideawas to turn these people into Air Defencepersonnel. Musso was prepared to give hisconsent under certain conditions but withoutany notification the Germans surrounded theairfields and detachments of the Italian forcesall over N.ttaly, cut the telephone lines andsevered 11 contact between the officers andmen and the outer world. Having done thisthey gave them the choise of being incorporatedinto German forces and going aboard aircraftor joining A. A. units, and asked for an imine-diate reply. The majority had said that theycould not act without the orders of the ItalianHigh Command. They consequently remainedinterned. Sub sequently the Germans asked Mussoto issue orders to them, but as he was requiredto tell them to swear allegiance to Hitler hehad felt bound to refuse. Even Musso's FinanceMinister had is car commandeered by the S.S.though they knew the identity of the occupant.Musso himself was determined to carry on inspite of these difficulties, even if it meanta dramatic trial and an end by shooting.ne apparently made this statement with anextremely pathetic expression. Musso referredonce more to the advicehe had given Hitleron the Brenner Pass on no account to go to warwith Russia. He felt this had been thecardinal blunderLord Swinton came in to see us all today. Heseemed extremely full of beans. I told himsomething about our work in connection with theCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/1955uSecond Front. He was extreinely interested tohear about the work of B.la, the major outlineof which he seems to have learned from the PM.The PM said that the operation would probablynot have succeeded had we not been able to keepthe Germans from committing themselves for amatter of 2-3 weeks. I also told Swinton aboutwhat we had done for .I.planning and theprovision of staff for SHAEF and subordinateformations.Sclater has discovered that the Americans aretalking pretty freely on radio-telephonecircuits to France. they give away quite alot about the transport of equipment and theports to which this equipment is destined.We are taking this up with Peter Reid.The attitude of the Russians at the moment isquite interesting. It would seem that theyhave almost deliberately left the resistancemovement in Warsaw in the lurch. They haverefused to allow our planes to drop arms. Atany rate they will not allow them to land onRussian soil after doing SO. We have neverthe-less provided quite a lot in the way of foodand equipment. It seems to me that theirpolicy is to occupy such territory as theyintend to hold after the war, namely theBalticstates, east Poland and Bessarabia and to extendtheir forces over such parts of the Balkans asthey consider to be within their sphere ofinterest. They probably think that it will bean asset to them to be in occupation when theGermans put up te White flag. This probablyaccounts for their present drive through theBalkans Catalogue anReferentcheekviagscontinuing their55offensive on the Warsaw front. There are strongindications that in the Baltic they intend togo as far as Koenigsberg. As a quid pro quothey are suggesting to the Poles that theyshould occupy Germany on the line rudding duesouth from Stettin which will include Breslauand Upper Silesia. The Poles are not particu-larly anxious to have the territory, which woulddoubtless be a permanent thorn in their sides.This however would suit the ussians sinceit would drive a permanent wedge betweenGermany and Poland and cause Poland to leanon Russia. In urkey the Nussians are anxiousto see the Anglo-Turkish alliance abandoned.Presumably they imagine that as long as itexists there is a threat to their flank. Mean-while they are intriguing in Persian Azabaijawhich may well declare its desire to join theUSSR. This would of course be brought aboutby eruption from within. Th is also possiblethat the Russians may wish to have certainrights over the Persian Railway which wouldgive an outlet for their goods to the PersianGulf. Generally speaking they are fairly activein the Eastern Mediterranean. They are extendintheir consulates to Palestine, yria and bran,and taking quite a keen interest in politicalaffairs in those countries. There is also talkof their building a canal through Bulgaria tothe Mediterranean with German labour.Numerous memos are being produced as to whatthe Germans are likely to do when we occupytheir country. These are of course mostlyspeculative. There is a certain amount ofinformation about the Nazis going to ground andforming a kind of maguis, Doubtless suchCatalogue Reference:KV/456preparations have been made. It will beinteresting to see how far they can offer anyeffective resistance. My own view is that whenthe Germans have collapsed the majority of themwill become ab ject. If they realise that thevarious allied missions are really going totake control and exterminate the Party theywill probably come forward in large numbers ardsupply information. It may however take themsome time to realise that freedom of speechonce more exists in the country, and that theycan express their views without the risk ofbeing shot. Much will depend on the firmnesswith which the allied authorities act since thefirst target of any undergriond movement willundoubtedly be those who collorate and furnishinformation to the occupyi ing forces. Theremay be a certain amount of trouble in theearly stages but I an not inclined to thinkthat it will last very long. Certain authoritiewill probably escape to Spain and theArgentineand try to infiltrate money ,instructions andarms to resisters, but should not be toodifficult to deal with this situation.The other main line will be propaganda abroadto get a modification in the armistice termsand a relaxation of control. This is likelyto be intensive as the years go on ind therewillrdoubtless be a large number of people bothhere and in America who will agitate against acontinuous occupation.At the weekly meeting Burley gave us the presentposition in the discussions taking place at theH.0. about the relaxation of travel conditions.There is to be mainten nce of check on aliensfrom Catalogue the Referenee:kvf4/f95 a retention of the57existing control for 2 or 3 months after StageA to fit in with the arrangements for Censor-ship CO trol. In fact conditions will revertto those existing at the early stages of thewar. There will be about 59000 former enemyagents who will want to go home. It will benecessary to distinguish between British andaliens going through the ports. Every one willtherefore still have to carry a passport whatoever their nationality or destination.

At present he is inthe hands of the Americans in France.

Miss adeson pointed out thatif this was to be properly covered there wasthe SHAEF index as well as PID, our ownCentral Registry,RB, SIS and SOE. We agreedthat if things were working properly the SISand SOE material should get on to the SHAEFindex, and that if any unification of recordswas to take place we ought to try and get suchcards from SHAEF as are based on informationother than that which we have supplied to SHAEF.Meanwhile there seemed no point in LRC carding"white" people in occupied territory as wellas "black". It was desirable we thought tostart before long rpuning the LRC registrywith a view to its absorption by the CentralRegistry. copies of the As relevant SO n as this SHAEF had cards taken could place godirect toBlenheim. All of this of course woulddepend on the cessation of the LRC'S normalInctions. As long as they existed theywould have to keep their own registry.September 14thJeffes came to see me about Backy of PassportControl's son who has got himself into veryserious trouble with the police. He is beingprosecuted at the Exeter assizes for theft andCataleguelReferenselkvqa/noser charges against60him, in the metropolitan area. Jeffes wasanxious if possible to keep the father's con-nectionwith Passport Control out of the papers.This had been done at the police court pro-ceedings in Torquay.

There is obviously a closeliaison between KUH and RANN. KANN gives KUHinformation about civil affairs intentions inGermany on the understanding that KUH does notpublishanythi which would be traceable toSHAEF. We came to the conclusion that anydirect action on the present information wouldblow our source. It was decided therefore toget Press and Censorship to let us see copiesof all KUH'S telegrams. If there was any thingwhich pointed even remotely to a leakage fromSHAEF an enquiry could be made which wouldprobably have the necessary deterrent effect.Kellar came to talk to me about his future.He is I think anxious to stay here but feelsthat opportunities are now passing by whichmight be more remunerative, and that if someassurance is to his future prospects herecannot be given he ought to consider tham.tlon eifalggu course brings us back to is the inadequate, old ques-6|and to the future status of the office which isundecided.Stephens came to see the D. G. and we had adiscussion about the proposal that he should setup an 020 in Germany. the D.G. in a letter toMaunsell has laid down the conditions thatStephens should hive a certain independance inthe running of 020 and should employ to someextent the same methods that he has beenemploying here. In particular the D.G. wishedfor an undertaking that he would not be askedto use any third degree methods. 020 had aperfectly clean record in this respect and itwould be highly undesirable from the point ofview of our dept. and the country as a whole ifsuch methods were used. The D.G. had in mindthat Maunsell's record in this respect was notaltogether clean. There E had 1 think beena case of his sandbagging somebody in the MidEast and one of his employees there had ideasabout the use of Evipan, the drug which issupposed to make people talk. In fact Evipanis quite useless and in any case it would beundesirable to use it. Equally third degreewas just as likely to produce bad resultsas good; apart from the moral side, it neverpays. Stephens is I think quite keen to do thejob but does not wish to be stuck in Germanyfor 5 or 10 years. He wants ultimately toreturn to this office.Louis de BRAY the notorious character who pene-trated our eescape routes on the continent andhas been instrumental in denouncing a largenumber of allied subjects,has been captured and isbeing Catalogue sent Referenee:kivarsBgation.loSeptember 15thlast night.I met Caulfeild at the club/ He told me thatLong, the Australian DNI, had been to see him andhad talked for nearly 2 hours about Ogilvy andothers in Australia. Caulfeild had taken anintense dislike to Long, who had got very over-excited and used most abusive language about theAustralian Security Service and those whodirected it. He had some idea that the DO wouldgive him his support in setting up anotherSecurity Service, of which he would presumablbe the head. He said that Qgilvy was nothingbut a political intriguer looking after simp-son's interests and that he had the idea ofbecoming head of the Australian Security Servicehimself. Caulfeild gave Long no encouragementwhatever. He told him that he could not possib-ly expect the D.4. to give him any support insetting up a security service in Australia.The Australian Govt. had established theSecurity Service under Simpson and obviouslyMI5 would have to liaise with him unless thegovernment thought otherwise. If Long had acase against his own Security Service he shouldput it up through the proper channels.In May of this year IPI wrote an interestingmemo on the subject of Jap espionage againstIndia. Very little was known before the warexcept that the Japs through their consulatesand through their principle companies and bankswere collecting information and carrying outpropaganda in a rather erude fashion. Theprincipal figures in Japan for conducting propa-ganda in India before the war were the well-known revolutionaries Rash Behari Dose, AnandMohan Sahay and the ineffective Mahendra Pratap.Thatalague ueReference!kvi4/195 also paying par-G3ticular attention to northern India tribalterritory, contacted mainly through the Legationinterpreter, Abdul Hamid. After the outbreak ofwar these activities were continued by Inouyehead of the Jap intelligence organisation inAfghanistan and ultimately led to the notoriousSILVER case, in which Bhagat Ram and SubhasChandra Bose were concerned. Activities werealso developed in Turkey where the Jap Embassy atAnkara were subsidising Inomoto, correspondentof the Tokio Nitchi Nitchiy who had arrangedfor the establishment of a branch office atDelhi of the Spanish newspaper Vangardia. TheDelhi correspondent was Chaman Lal of the Hin-dustan Times, who provided a regular supply oflow-grade political information which was con-trolled. In Lisbon the Japs endeavoured tomake use of an Indian merchant named Qureshi.Under the Indian Independ ence League, controlledby Rash Behari Bose, were concentrated renegadeIndians from all over the Far East. As far backas 1937 the Japs had inspired the training ofa certain number of Indian collaborators whomoved with the Jap troops and established localIndependence Associations in Japanese occupiedterritory. Agents were subsequently recruitedfrom the ranks of this organisation. A secondimportant source from which the Japs couldselect Indians for work in India was the IndianNational Army which had been formed from subornedIndian P/Ws. This the Japs began to create in1941. Frisoners were persuaded by propaganda andill-treatment to volunteer for service with theJapanese. The Intelligence Section of the IndianNation il Army was known as the Iwakuro Kikan,a department established to take charge of 5thatalogue eerenOEERVAA9SivitiE in Burma andtuMalaya. Col. Iwakuro who was at the head of thisorganisation was replaced by Yamamoto in March1943. The organisation had its headquarters inBangkok and branches at Singapore,P Penang andRangoon with a sub-branch at Aky ab. Each ofthese branches was under the control of a Japan-ese colonel with a staff of Japanese officersand civilians assisted by Indians of the I.I.L.and the I.N.A. At first the training given wassuperficial and the men chosen for work were-capable of carry ing out the tasks ellotted tothem. By the end of 1942 however the instruc-tions were becoming more efficient and detailedand the last party of agents reported to havearrived in India in the last part of 1943 2wereconsidered to be superior and bettery trainedin every way than those who had come before.It has become customary to refer to to theseagents as the Japanese-Inspire Fifth columnistswhich has been abbreviated to J.I.F.S. Thefirgeganiserties reached India by land fromBurma in May 1942 amongst Indian refugees.There were 3 parties each consisting of 5 men.They were instructed to colleet military informa-tion and find out the attitude of the IndianArmy vis-vis a Japanese invasion of India.They were to communicate by wireless throughtwo Siamese who have never been identified. Atthe end of Sept. 1942 the first graduates of ashort training course at Benang arrived in Indiain two parties, each consisting of 5 Indians,who landed from Jap submarines near Dwarka in Kath-iawar and near Tanur in Malabar. The agentswere Kalayalam and all civilians. They were tocollect military information and spread propagan-da. Each was to establish connection with anCatalogue Reference:KVI4/195opposite number who would be travelling to Indiaby land and would remain in the vicinity of theeastern frontier in order to pass on to Durmathe information which had been collected. Theplan came to nothing as all the submarine agentswere captured. At the end of april 1943 or thebegiinmng of Ma about 50 Indian students leftin several parties for deep penetration tasksin India. Many of them were duly picked up onarrival. They were to sabotage communica-tions and to prevent demolition by Britishtroops in the case of a Jap invasion. hey werealso to make contact with revolutionary partiesand spread propaganda. In pril 1943 7 partiesof agents were dropped by parachute in Assam.5 parties consisted of military personnel and2 of civilian. Each comprised 3 men inc ludinga wireless operator. Agents had been carefullyprepared and were to collect information aboutaerodromes, trcop concentrations, bridges,recruitment and public morale. They were advisedto go to the nearest congress centre should theyrun short of money. All the members of 6 ofthese parties were arrested. The 7th is believedto have jumped too soon and to have been lostin the jungle. The most recent party ofagents reported landed again by submarine nearDwarkar on Dec. 23rd 1943. This party consistedof 8 agents, 4 of whom were ex-P/W from Germany.They were to work in pairs and were equipped withW/T. They were instructed to collect militaryand political intelligence which was to be trans-mitted to the Bengal pair and thence to anenemy control station. They received instructionfrom Subhas Chandra Bose and were told to makecontact with his brother and other persons. TheyCatalogue Reference:KV/4/195were well trained and equipped with arms in-cluding Japanese grenades and incendiary devices.They were all arrested despite the fact th that itthey had been landed on a lonely part of thecoast and had quickly made their way to distantparts of the country. Members of the partyreported that another party had been landed inCeylon by submarine in the previous Decemberbut no confirmation of this had been obtained.In all up to april 1944, no less than 2,575persons are known to have been despatched onvarious missions or to be in training. Missionsincluded not only espionage but also sabotage,propaganda and the suborning of troops in theforward areas. Of the 2,575 there were 967at training centres or INA camps, 653 in theChindwin area, 341 in Arakan, 559 picked up and35 at large in India. 20 were unaccountedfor. The 559 captured but of a possible 614belonged to 151 different parties of one ormore members. The probability is that at leastsome of those at large having obtained theirobjective in getting to their native land arerefraining from any activities which mightattract attentionn. it has been shown from theabove that the Japs were very quick to put in'operation their pre-war plan to make use ofIndians in the Far East. The material availablewas however poor and their methods somewhatcrude. Consequently the must have been disappoin-ted with the results. Training and selectionof agents has however improved. The Japs have inPubhas Chandra Bose an Indian leader of inter-national repute and a man of outstanding abilityand not lacking in personality. His influenceon the I.I.L and the I.N.A. cannot therefore beignafdgue Referenceare4ine Btefthe it should not beforgotten that as a race Indians are supportersof China rather than Japan and the subservienceof the majority in the Far East to the apsn cansafely be attributed to force majeure. Thatthis majority have given nothing more than lipservice to the Japs is clear from the attitudeof the J.I.F.S who have returned to India. Ithas hitherto been rather rare for them to makeany attempt to carry out the tasks imposed onthem by the Japs once they have been beyondJap control. So far as is knewn no one of themhas hitherto succeeded in establishingtcontactwith Subhas Bose's own Bengali terrorist followerin India for for that matter with revolutionaryelements which count or are not already undercontrol.report from SEAC dated 5th august 1944 showsthat through their own ineptitude andthrough our deception policy the Japs have beensingularly ill-informed about the dispositionof our units. In determinging our order ofbattle they had the following sources ofinformation:(a) contact with important elementsof our forces for over 2 years; (b) capturedA prisoners and documents in considerable quan-brcies; (c) they had from their allies materialbearing directly or indirectly on our order ofbattle in the eastern theatre; (d) they had anumber of Indian agents infiltrated into ourrearward areas who should have been difficultfor us to control; (e) they had Bose and hisorganisations at their disposal.' Where theyhave been assisted by the Germans e.g. withextracts from information fed to the Germans andfrom genuine identification on the western andmediterranean Catalogue Reference:kv/4/195 estimates areintelligible though erroneous. But where theJaps have been left to their own sources or haverejected German advice results of their intelli-gence work is lamentable and shows marked in-eptitude. Indications from special sourcesare that Yokio is unlikely in the future to getany more accurate overall picture of our orderof battle than heretofore. Moreover considera-tions of "face" make it improbably that Tokiowill view with favour reports of any reductioof the estimated strength of SEAC in view ofthe failure of the Japanese armies in Burmaarea.V. 2 continues at the rate of 2 or 3 per 24 hours.The remarkable thing is that the explosionsare heard quite definitely even when the rocketfalls at a distance of up to 20 miles away.Since lateral blast is not near SO great, asthat of V.l, it may be that some new explosiveis being employed whch has a vertical blast, andthe sound therefore carries further.Major Mallam same to see me. He was formerlyin Home Forces and is being sent out as a G. 2to Brig. Howman, head of security in India.He wants to get some sort of idea about theworkings of this office. As far as I ean see heis more interested in themachinery than in ac-tual methods of investigation. He is to see theportS,LR( etc.I had a talk with Brooman-white about V.2. Theonly reason for not publishing is that the Germanhave said nothing about V.2 and may therefore bein some doubt as to where their rockets areLangaigue whether 'beetefncnkBriitigss territory or in the69sea, On the other hand there is some indicationthat the Spaniards may have been passing oninformation. If this is SO the obvious coursewould be to make a simple announcement thatV.2 had started and that no information wouldbe communicated as to where the rockets arefalling. The Press are apparently anxious toget at Luncan Bandys whose statements reg rdingV.l and counter-measures have rather given theimpression that the government was slow offthe mark butthat every thing was now over. Theresult has been th t families are pouring back ininto London, when they had much better remainoutside for the time being.

'There has beenone case of a rocket bursting in the air,probably due to over-heating. This has 1 believebeen one of the main troubles which the Germanshave had to content with.We entered Germany the day before yesterday.The attitude of the population as described by aB.B.C. war reporter is not without interest.They came forward with flowers, seemed to bepleased to see the troops, said they had beenwaiting a long time for them, that 90% of thepeople were anti-Nazi and that they hoped weshould go right through to Berlin and put an endto the Nazi regime. They said that all the localNazis had left with the armies. 'If this istypical of what we shall meet every where inGermany it shows that the German is still runningtrue to form. The attitude seems to be just theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19570same as it was at the end of the last war whenwe marched into the Rhineland. 90% of thepopulation were ready to lick our boots. Onlyin one case did I remember them behaving in acorrect manner. This was at a billet where theinhabitants gave us everything we asked for butclearly did not wish to have any thing to do withus. I believe that 20% of the population mightbe regarded as being violentlyanti-Nazi,10% violently pro-Nazi, and the remaining 70%quite ready to swim with the stream. If asappears the Nazis are moving back with the armiesour advance should ct as a kind of net whichshould eventully round up the majority of the babad hats. I feel that our best policy would beto tell all German minorities to go back totheir own country, to refrain from carving upGermany in any arbitrary way, but to be adamanton the queation of remrmament and conscription.Once we have more or less purged the country ofthe bad elements we should allow the Germans tosort out their own troubles, as far as is com-patible with maintaining strict control overany attempts to rearm. This would be far betterthan keeping a foot permanently on their necksand then being forced to give way bit by bitin the face of public opinion which will clamourfor the regeneration of German trade and theremoval of a large occupational force which willbe costing the country immense sums of money.September l6thThe Times todaypublished the figures of bombdamage done since the beginning of the war andby flying bombsCatalogue ReferenCE:KV/4/fgsd Reference generally.ORIGINAL DOOUMENLRETAINED DOOUMENLI RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDEF SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958.

It is a town whichhouses many monks and priests and a largecassocked group was standing cheering ourentry. I noticed one very big man ho lookedvaguely out of place. He was red-headed andred-bearded, and his eyes were bright. Then thescales fell and I saw - he could have been inTimbuctoo or Honolulu but here was unquestionablyan Irishman. As we rolled by his agitationseemed to boil over. His priestly training,his cure of souls, bis eoctrinates of history, hihis neutrality and all else seemed to fall awayin a single second.

He was also present at all conferen-ces with von Eschweger in Paris not onlyregarding French sabotage but also with suchpersons as Umberto from Madrid, officials fromBerlin,Belgium Belgium and Holland.

He has papers and photo-graphs showing himself as an officer in theWaffen S.S. He is now in hostpial, having beenwounded at the barricades in Brussels. Hisgeneral story is that he joined the S.S etc.in order to get as much information as he could.We sh 11 get an entirely independent statementfrom him and them probably have another go atMATON.I saw Craufurd and Buster on the case of SLUBICKI.We decided we should get special examiners toopen a letter which MOLDICKI was carrying forKAMINSKI of the Polish mission here. We shouldthen interrogate SLUBICKI again and tell himthat we propose to speak to MOLDICKI aboutthe smuggling of the dimonds. He would thenhave an opportunity of modifying his formerstatements nd of giving us his views on thissubject. Our belief is that SLUBICKI intendedto keep the diamonds and that he has for sometime known about the smuggling. It was naturallybhay when he foresaw trouble that he brought themto the British authorities. Ultimately wepropose to take the matter up with the Poles onthe grounds that the diamonds were brought intoCatalogue Reference:KV/4/195Gib. illicitly by the Polish BOAC pilot JONIKASand that these diamonds apparently were despat-ched from this country. We are also suggestingto S.B. that they should pull in JONIMAS andthe other pilot with a view to their interroga-tion.Hunter came to see me about the future of B. 3.6. 6.I told him that subject to any thing that Hollishad to say he would probably want about 12good watchers after the war and that it wasessential that these people should be wellpaidand should have some pension scheme. They arepeople who have to do highly confidential workand it is therefore desirable that it should notbe worth their while to leave us and take onother employment. They should go through afairly probationary period.Miss Shaw came to see me about the sabotagesquad in Spain. I said that until we saw howthings were going to develop it might beadvisable just to keep a few of them who couldbe used in cases of emergency. The presentsquad consists of about 22. It seemed to mejust possible that some of the more des-perate Nazis might ultimately land up inspain and try to damage our ships. We shouldthen look rather foolish if we had no meansof dealing with them.September 19thI attended a meeting of the JICat which DMIIndia's paper on the future of Intelligence inMid East, India and the Far East was considered.The ataioguesrerererce.KVt4/i9s Catalogue a few minutes.Cawthorne compained that had the German movesbeen successful in the Caucasus and in Egypt,there was no stay-behind organisation and in factno organisation at all in the pre-war period.He thought that some centralised IntelligenceBureau on the lines of CICI, which would haverepresentatives both in the Mid East and India,might be a solution. Cavendish-Bentinck thoughtvaguely that JIC Egypt and JIC India co-ordinatedby JIC London, would meet the case, but that atthe moment it was not possible to say any thin(definite. He thought therefore that Cawthorne'spaper should ome up again at a later date."C" said that Cawthorne could take it that hisactivities in Persia were closely co-ordinatedwith those of DIB. Cawthorne said that neitherne nor Pilditch, of DIB, had any idea bout whatwas proposed. It had been suggested some timeago that there should be a meeting of all theparties interested but nothing came of it.Onthis the discussion ended and Cawthorne's memohas been filed for future reference.I had a talk with Cavendish-Bentinck after themeeting. I asked him whether he considered thepaper was concerned mainly with offensive intelligence and whether he was proposing to discussC. I. aspects of the problem, but he had clearlyno wish to go any further. Cawthorne held theveew that something in the nature of SIME witha representative in India and Mid East, shouldcontinue on a joint V/VI basis. de said thatin fact SIS had no aganisation at all which wasworth ttalking about and that the personnel theyemployed was extrememly indifferent.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19577He thought that a territorial division of func-tions is nonsense and that some form of unifi-cation should take place. He was in fact quiteviolent on the subject. I pointed out tohim that nothing on these lines could very wellcome about until some solution was obtained atheadquarte S. We had ideas on this subjectwhich we were trying to put forward but whetherwe should be successful or not was aothermatter.Craufurd has seen SLUBICKI and with the latter'sconcurrence has talked to MOLDICKI. MOLDICKIsays that he knows something about the businessof the diamonds but that being an army officerhe cannot speak without the authority of hissuperiors. The letter that he is carrying to KAKAMINSKI contained nothing of any interest.With S.B.S concurrence we propose to put thefacts to KAMINSKI and suggest to him that thepolice should be allowed to investigate.Meanwhile we are urging SB to get hold ofJONIKAS.TAR, Marriott and Buster came to tall to meabout the possibility of MI5 being allowedan officer in Paris. This seemed particularlynecessary since clearly the French 2eme Bureauhave a large number of reports from peoplethey are arresting daily wich would be ofinterest to us. We shall not get them unlesswe have someone on the spot. Secondly it willfor some time be necessary for us to sendofficers out to what was formerly occupiedterritory for the purpose of clearing up oldcafafginkeferericgkvi4genegades. Unless we16have someone in Paris who is in touch with theAmericans with an office and a car it will notbe possible for us to get very far. Dick isat present in Brussels where he is going totry and suggest to the Belgians that they shouldask for the services of Brook-Booth in thecapacity of an M.I.5 liaison officer. If wecan get this across there seems no reason whywe should not have someone in Paris and late.on at the Hague. It is of course part of ourscheme for dividing intelligence into offensiveand defensive. If we take the defensive sidewe shall certainly have representatives in theprincipal capitals.Roger Hollis came to talk to me about renegades,both civil and military. The H.0. are beingvery sticky about getting any of these peopleback here. They do not wish to retain powersunder the DRs to keep renegades in detentionhere. Equally they do not seem very anxiousto get a bill through the House. Still lessdo they want the renegades wandering about inthis country since this would undoubtedly giverise to questions in the House. They aretherefore suggesting to the Home Defence Exe-cutive that the army should detain them inFrance until such time as the necessary evidencehas been accumulated for their prosecution.I see the advantages of this but it seems to mea little weak-kneed.Cussen has seen P.G.

Isaid that if we were either to keep good peoplehere or get good recruits, it was absolutelyessential that we should pay our staff at ahigher rate. We could not be compared withordinary civil servants who when they reachthe higher grades had a very wide field forpromotion. If this office were given a largersphere of activity and was loosely knit withother intelligence branches set up in thevarious Service depts. there would be oppor-tunities here. If on the other hand we werereduced to our pre-war level there was absolute-ly no inducement for anybody to join the dept.except ex-officers or ex-officials who hadreached pension age. Charles said that he wasglad I had put this point of view as he andHorrocks were considering what our budget tothe Treasury should be. He wants me to havea talk with him and Horrocks on Thursday morn-ing. I am quite sure that we should notgrade our officers in any way until we knowwhat the future shape of things is to be.Lennox came to see me. He wanted to have myopinion of Maunsell. He said that he had heardfrom many sources that he was extremely ambi-tious and would like to be head of this office.I told Lenox that I was well aware of this butI was not worry ing very much at the moment.He said that the battle was going very well.

Thereis some doubt about the reason which promptedthe payment of the additional E50 which appearsto be in the nature of a bonus.

We felt that thefirst point to be decided by the HDE waswhether Catalogue military Referehce:KV/4/195 and should be treated6gm an equal basis. If this is agreed then someLegislation will have to be passed to preventcivil or military renegades who have alreadybeen sent back here from mov ing about thecountry. Although the H.0. suggestion thatthe armies in the field should hold renegadesuntil such evidence is obtained to stage aprosecution would be quite a suitable arrange-ment from our point of view it is we think justas likely to raise questions in the House asany other procedure. We all felt doubtfulwhether the military would be prepared toaccept the obligation. The probability isthat the H. 0. will be forced to get a billthrough the House authorising the detentionof renegades for a period of 6 months pendinginvestigation of their cases.Hollis told the weekly meeting briefly whatthe position was in this matter.Hart is proposing to stop issuing a weekly ISOSsummary as the reports are now quite worthless.Milmo said that a German Red Cross ship, theRostock, had been captured by the Navy in theWest Atlantic as it was not notified as a Re?Cross ship, and brought into Plymouth.

Hansteijn; the hiefof Staff., Rocher-Lund, head of Intelligence,Nagel, head of C.I., Gleditsch of L.1. andone other were present. All of them seem tobe extremely keen on maintaining the goodrelations with us that have been establishedduring the last 4 years. They would very muchlike to see an MI5 representative in Oslo.In any case for the moment--they proposetoleave someone behind to keep touch. Olafis of course bi-linguil in English, having beenborn and largely educated here. He wasvery pleasant and struck me as -being intelli-gent. He has also a keen sense of humour.Hansteijn is a very pleasant persnality. Healked-a-certain-amount-a aboutthe-Finnish aboutthwar of which he had some first-hand information.I asked him whether he thought that when theyattacked the Finns in 1940 the Russians haddeliberately leliberately-used-untrained-troops-and-poorequipment in order to mislead the Germans.He said definitely no, the Russians had useduntrained-t trooped as-they-had-very-much-under-estimated the strength of the Finns, whoextremely courageous -and good fighters]e Laon the: Russians had realised their mistake-nd-put-experienced-troops-and better equipmentinto the field.

I think he feels it something of a deadend-and- will not-be-sorry--to-go-back not back to-duty:Satalegusefeence:kytii9st the internecine83strife which goes on in all intelligenceorganisations. The Norwegians are apparentlyno exception to the general rule. He was veryanxious to maintain touch with our office whichhad given valuable oo-operation. He hoped thiswould go on during the post-war period. Nagelis well disposed towards us but not such anattractive personality as Gleditsch who isobviously the best u. I.officer the Norwegianshave. He really knows his stuff. TheNorwegi ns evidently intend to deal fairlydrastically with their renegades.September 2lstI had a talk with hirles and Horrocks about thefuture of the office. The D.G. has apparentlytalked to John Anderson who has asked him tolet him have some estimate as to what he thinksour future budget will be. This the D.G. haspromised to give him and Charles a.nd Horrockshave been told to provide the figures. I saidthat I felt this was rather putting the cart bef-fore the horse. It was impossible to budgetuntil we knew what our commitments weregoing to be. These at the moment were verymuch in the air although we were doing all we ccould to press for some sort of settlement.We had reached a stage where we were proposingto say to Arnold-Foster that we could neitheraccept a total amalgamation nor SIS absorptionof B and F divisions, leaving only what Nasdescribed asn an executive rump. In our viewthe only possible solution was to have a defen-sive and offensive organisation. We should beresponsible Catalogue Reference:KV/4/195 Reference. for the and SIS for thelatter. If Arnold-Foster felt that a deadlockhad been reached we should have to take thematter to higher authority,eit to Bridgesor to Joh Anderson with a request th t thecase should be submitted to arbitration.Ipointed out to Charles and Horrocks thatthis was becoming a matter of very greaturgency since we were in danger of losinggood officers who for lack of any knowledgeof their future were considering eithergoing back to private life or taking on jobswith CCMS or UNRRA. Further, Section Vwere recruiting all sorts of personnel forjobs abroad after the war.. If we were goingto be in control of CI activities we shouldlike to have some say in the personnel whowere going to be employed. Haldane Porter whohas just got back tells me he has a definiteoffer from Felix for permanent employment.He is not very keen about joining Section Vnd would really much rather stay with us buthe must be told something definite. I toldCharles and Ho rocks that I thought it wasof paramount importance that we should pay ourpeople well, particularly if we were not goingto be able to offer then amy wider field forpromotion than the one which exists at present.If there were no compensating advantages in paywe should never be able to get good people. Itmay be true that through our honesty Ne tandwell with the Treasury but it will not do muchgood if as a result of cheese-paring we loseall our good officers. I think both Charlesand Horrocks saw my point. The great thingis to get on with the proposals for amalgama-tion with SIS.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19587Dick came in today. He has just returned fromBrussels, where he had a talk with BillNilliams,Montys Ss BGSI. Apparently the lateststrategical move by which we are outflankingthe Rhine in Holland was Monty's and it nowlooks as if 21st Army Group are likely to bethe first in Berlin. The view of the staff isthat ie we can get the bridge at Niemijn andalso at Arnhem, there will be very littleto stop us. Niemijn has in fact fallne todayand a link has been formed with our first air-borne division. It is estimated that some100,0 German troops are between our forcesand the Dutch coast.I have given Dick a copy of art's note onthe amalgamation of ourselves ind Section V.He is going to study it and we hope to discussit on Saturday.Dick was not able to make any progress inBrussels with regard to the appointment of BrookBooth. He felt that the atmosphere was for themoment too confused. He intends to try againa little later when uepage has settled down.I told him that there was already a necessityfor some similar appointment in Paris to deal(a) with renegades ind (b) with intelligencegenerally and liaison with the French. Doubtlessthere will be strenuous opposition to any suchappointment from SIS although as at present cons-tituted they cannot possibly carry our problems.I have asked Dick to find out about the courseto CI officers which McDemott has asked us togive in Brussels. He had never got my telegramon the ubjectCatalogue eference:KV/4/195Lastly I told him about the difficulties wewere having with the American Army Group ingetting bodies back here in an orderly fashion.If he could look into this matter when he gotto Paris it might be a good thing.Bonnefous came in to pay his respects and totell me that he was shortly leaving for Paris.He will however leave behind sever 1 officerswho will continue the liaison with ourselvesHe seemed to be very appreciative of all wehad done and hoped that we could keep in closetouch and appoint an officer for liaison purposein Paris. I said we should be very glad to dothis if we could possibly obtain the necess ryauthority, since at the moment Paris as a sta-tion was outside our sphere.Philip came in to see me. Since he left herehe has been working in NID6 at oxford. Iasked him how far he regarded the work of hisdept as being of V lue and what its limitationswere. He S id thut basically they worked ondirectories, photographs sent in by the public,and guide books. Information supplied byindividu ls unless they happened to be tech-nicians in some particular line, was generalsyof doubtful value. He said this was notsurprising since if anyone were to ask him togive informatio about the supply of gas,electricity and water in the city of Oxford where hehad lived all his life ne rly, he would be com-pletely at Sea. Equally he would not be ableto give width of the roads or the strength ofthe bridges. Nevertheless it seems that thereports tout in by NID6 have been of value inItaly Catalogue ue Reference:KV4/195ill but people who have accurate8eminds would infinitely prefer to cut out muchin these reports which is doubtful. NID6 arenow trying to work up a report on Japan. Thisis an extremely difficult matter iwing to thepaucity of any information regarding thatcountry. I asked Philip what he thought Nouldbe the value of NID in peace time. He saidthat there was obviously an attempt to carryon the organisation by certain interested partieHe himself however felt that it would bea pure waste of time and money to keepexpensive records about all towns,ports, rail-ways, roads etc in all foreign countries wherewe might conceivably be engaged in war, atsome distant date. On the other hand he agreedwith me that some record of the machbnerynandmethod of working employed by NID6 which couldbe put into operation about Munich-time wouldbe of value. Meanhwhile the show should bedisbanded.The D G. has had a letter from Duff, I thinkinspired by Victor, suggesting that Cussen shoulgo over to Paris to discuss the security ofthe PM's visit there some time next month.I pointed out to the U.G. that while Ithought Cussen might be able to ascertainthrough Paillole of the 2eme bureau the generalstate of law and order in the country and thereliability of the Prefecture and Surete, hecould not very well go further since the pro-tection of the PM was essentially an SB res-ponsibility. If the PM or the King and Queen wevisiting Parss in peac ce time it would be forCanning to get into touch with the Prefectureand Surete in order to make the necessary arrangcatalogue gue Reference:KV/4/195s sead officers over90with the PM. If we tried to inerfere in thisand something went wrong we should be heldresponsible for a matter which we in fact werequite powerless to control. The DG thoroughlyappreciated this point.September 22ndI dined at 020 last night. Stephens seems alittle worried by the vagaries of Ken Johnso.and Maunsell in regard to his future. He isworking with Rawlinson to set up some jointestablishment in Getmany under CCMS. He wantsto feel that he is still an officer of MI5and can have direct access to us when he wantsto. I said that I did not think there wouldbe the slightest difficulty in this but thatwe had made a great point of telling the Armythat when we lent them personnel they werefor all purposes in the army. At the sametime we had made it clear that we felt we hadthe right to say from time to time that wethought this or that officer should eitherreturn to HQ or be employed on duties wherehis services and experience were urgentlyrequired. We h id established for ourselvesquite a namemin military sircles owing tothe contribution we had made to the SecondFront and the value of our organisation andofficers seem to be thoroughly appreciated.I did not think therefore that he would meetwith any difficulties, and that if he intimatedthat any particular case was of interest toMI5 his wishes would be respected. SIS onthe other hand nad got themselves a bad namein the army because they always wished to floutCatalogue Reference:KV/4/195army authority and advertise their independentstatus. This had led to many difficulties,and to their being regarded with some suspicion.It was important that we should avoid fallinginto the same trap.Stephens had a small complaint about thedifficulties he was experiencing in producinga report in 5 days concerning agents who havebeen brought back from the field. He saidthat by the time he got the property etc. thisperiod was often reduced to about 2 day s andthat his officers were in consequence havingto work very long hours. Apart from this hethought that the practice was a rather danger-ous one since a man might quite well tell onestory and at a later stage in the interroga-tion say that he had been lying and begin allover again. I said that I would took intothis but that the principle reason was that thearmies in the field were anxious to get inthe shortest possible time any information whichmight lead to the apprehension of other spiesor the disclosure of sabotage dumps. There wasa danger that if we did not give them someinterim report on these lines they would notdeliver up the bodies at all.I spoke to the D.G. about Courtney Young goingto France to clear up the tag-ends of the StellaLONSDALE case. He has agreed tothis.Roger has given me his views on the suggestedamalgamation between ourselves and Section Vand Section IX. He agrees that counter-espionagCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1959subversive movements and security should hangtogether. He feels however that if SIS takeover .Division they would be extremely embar-rassed by the extent to which Divisionactivities are likely to come out in the openat any time. He thinks that SIS should notattempt to study communism abroad withoutthe extremely important and in fact majorcontribution on the subject which is bound tocome from this country and may well affect t.F.O. far more than the possibility of arevolution in Brazil or Paraguay. He doesnot think however that the H.O. would evertolerate the placing of subversive movementsunder the F 0. He thinks, and I agree, thatmuch could be achieved if an offensive anddefensive organisation were established, underseparate heads but in the same building andworking to one registry. His suggestion is abuilding with exits on two different streetsSIS would have their entrance in one streetand ourselves in another and both would meetin the centre of the building. I said that Ithought that SIS would say that it was danger-ous for them to be in the same building asourselves but that such fears would be gabergroundless since the C.P. always know whereSIS are through following the couriers adddelivery vans.I talked to Cheney about the seamen's index.Horrocks and the D.G. G. and Adam have over theweekend decided to discontinue it though nofurther reference has been made either toBrook-Booth or myself.

The advantage ofthis of course would be that we should put goCatalogue Reference:KV/4/195THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958.Mo )odforward with SIS instead of being immediatelythrown into opposition. If scheme 1 is throwncut, it will be thrown out by the great oneswho villrealise that both C. and ourselvesconsider the present state of affairs unsatis-factory. This would inevitably lead to somesort of enquiry and arbitration. If on theother otherhandwe-g hand we go forward withour own schemein opposition to SIS they will probably wanto know what it is, pull it to pieces andhave the whole thing sat on by Eden or the PM.Our great difficulty is of course that theDG will hotly oppose scheme 1.I--had-ata -had-atalk-withSt alk with Stopford.

I said thatI would speak to Maunsell and suggest thatan interview could be arranged. He could thenstate his terms. I thought he might be welladvised to get them quit.e clear from Maunsell,and the job he was to do and rank he would hold.This might be difficult at the moment since thewhole organisation was in a somewhat fluidstate. Stopford is quite an able fellowbut is rather a lone hand, jealous of hisown preserves, somewhat dogmatic, and does notappear to get on very easily with other people.September 23rdDick came in to see me before going off toParis. We first discussed the position ofGisda. Dick will find out whether there isany chance of getting her into uniform for theuse of CCMS.Joe Stephenson is wanted for the Civil Securitysection of HAEF.

Dickwas in general agreement that we should do wellto agree with Arnold-Foster that total amal-gamation was undoubtedly the best remedy forthe difficulties of the present situation in SOfar as the collection, collation and distributionof information were concerned, but that fromsoundings that we had taken we were confidentthat the proposition would be turned downby the Ministers, and that we should find it.difficulty if not impossible to get the .G.to put it forward. Nevertheless if "C" likedto put it forward to the responsible authoritywe person lly would not mind. As an alterna-tive however we should try and get Arnold-Fosterto agree to reorganising on offensive anddefensive lines.In a paper produced by the JIC, the DMI hasgiven his views on what measuresshould beput in force to co-ordinate intelligence afterthe war. He thinks that JIC London should beconstituted as at present with C. and a repre-sentative of the Security Service as members.TIts responsibility would include SIS,SIGINT, Economic Intelligence and Geographi-cal Intelligence. Intelligence within theBritish Commonwealth would be co-ordinated inLondon. JIC London would consider the world asa whole, and issue general statements on policyto regional JICs. it would also ensure thedissemination of detailed intelligence. Itwould maintain contact with JIC Washington andwith allied intelligence organisations. TheDominions would have their own intelligenceCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1957organisatiins also in touch with London. Region-al JICs would be established in Cairo,Delhi, Delhi,Canberra and Ottawa, on the London model, witha representative of "C". No mention is madeof counter-intelligence. DMI also envisagesdominion representatives on all JICS.September 24thSniper has been promised a transmitter by theGermans in 10 days time. His future employmenteither here or in France has to be considered.Harmer is being asked whether he wishes to havehim in France.Baydur, the Turkish Ambassador in Moscow, isto be replaced by Salmi Sarper. Before leavinghe had an interview with the Vice-Commissarfor Foreign Affairs, Vishinsky. He told V.that he had observed that Soviet circles hadnot always been getting clear and accurateinformation about Turkey and that this had ledto misunderstandings. As an example Baydurmentioned that the view had been expressed inthe Moscow press that Turkey's non-aggressiopact with Germany was an action designed tosafeguard the German Army's right flank. Baydarsaid that the action of his country had merelybeen designed to defend its natinnal securityagainst a very powerful and aggressive state,which at that time was in a dominating positionin central Europe and the Balkans. He con-cluded his remarks by saying "And Moreover youyourselves signed a treaty with the Germansfor the same reason, and before we did.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/195aVishinsky merely replied that the reason forfor theirs was wellknown and passed on toanother point. He complained that people inTurkey had rejoiced when the Russians wereretreating. Baydur said that this merely meantthat some people held different views fromthe majority. This was not surprising in anation of 20 millions. It seemed to him toothat in Soviet Russia the public trials in thepast had been an indiction that evenimportant personages had held views contraryto the policy of the Soviet Govt. When suchthings happened theTurks did not say "Every-body in Russia thinks like that". V. replied"Yes, in our country we do not permit people togo against general conceptions. If they dowe punish them". The Turk said "We do the samein So far as our constitution permits".V. then touched on the Turkish attitude to thewar. He said that Turkey could have hlped byentering the war. Baydur Said that Turkeycould not have entered the war since it was anation which had to make war and not angovernment. Demoeratic governments werebound to keep in view the nation's desirein the matter of entering war. Turkeywould defend her frontiers but there weremany political and military considerations tobe taken into account. he could not assumethe responsibility of dragging her countryinto war unprepared.In the event of Rankin B or C conditions cominginto force, SOE have been assigned a number oftasks involving the rendering of assistanceto the allied commander. They are to furnisheatalogue Referenee:kv4/195tr local resistance79leaders and civil authorities, to assist inpreventing civil war and excesses by the popu-lace especially the partisans, to furnish localinformation regarding ports, airfields, roadsrails etc. and to booby-traps and otherpreparations left by the enemy, to assist inpreventing the destruction of naval, air andcommunication facilities and also publicutilities, to provide additional informationto C.I. regarding undesirables, to assist inthe recovery of escaping allied P/, and toprevent theescape of German or collaborationistofficials, to preserve records useful to theoccupying forces and machinery of technicalvalue.A CX.report gives an account of plans for apost-war German resistancemovement. The maincentre isto be in Styria but the Tyrol will alsobe a stronghold. The organisation is in thehands of Bormann. Partisan groups are beingtrained and are being entrusted with storesof poison gas for hiding. It is realised thatthe active resistance can only be temporaryand that the main work consists in layingche foundations of a secret organisationintended to operate years hence. The immediateobjectives are to prevent any group of Germansfrom overthrowing the present regime So thatthe idea cun be spread that Germany nevercapitualted nd that the struggle goes on.Afurther objective is to make sure that Hitlerdisappears in time and cannot be traced,whether in reality alive or dead, in order tomaintain the legend of his existance whichmust be kept goingCatalogue Reference.KV/4/195at costs for the nextD20 years or more. The whole organisation isbeing run by Himmler and is said to numberabout 25,00( all of whom have taken over theidentity papers of harmless non-Nazi Germans kilkilled in air raids and have moved away fromtherplaces of domicile thus rendering tracingthem difficult.A number of members of thisforce is to concetrate on attacks on pro-alliedGermans rather than on the allied occupationforces themselves.D.M.I. has put up a paper on military securitypolicy after the German surrender. He thinksthat security should be nintained in so faras it is necessary to safeguard 'a) futureoperations against Japan (b) forces occupy ingGermany, operations grinst resistance, theliquidation of German secret and politicalorganisations and the military administration(c) secret tactics,metho and equipment whichould be of value to any pther power. Theorder of battle should not be compromised tothe extent of revealing the forces to beemployed against Japan, revealing the degreeof our succeeses in building up a notionalorder of battle. This will involve keepingsecret until the surrender of Japan the orderof battle of forces remaining in Germany andthe order of battle of allied forces in the UK.The present standards of security should ingeneral be maintained for secret equipment, methodand tactics. It may also be found necessaryto safeguard information about German weapons wh:which may be used by the allies agains theJapanese.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/195A J.I.C. appreciation of the enemy situationin the acific states that Japan desires toavoid war with the USSR in order to be freeto direct her energies against her enemies.As a result of their fundamental beliefs themorale of the Japanese populace and especiallyof the armed forces has remained relativelyhigh, but a continuing series of sharp defeatswill tend further to confuse and disruptthe Japanese. Such defeats joined with thecollapse of Germany might conceivably cause are-shuffle of the ruling clique followed by anattempt to secure a negoti ted peace. Japanesepropaganda has already shifted from theoffensive to the defensive. Production of highpriority armaments and items such as aircraftmay continue to expand for some time even ifthe rapid growth of Japan's basic industryhas been levelling off since the beginning of1944. A further substantial growth of theJapanese steel and other basic industries isbelieved impossible, in the light of thepresent Japanese shipping position. whippingis now barely adequate to assist currentproduction rates in the basic industriesand sinkings exceed launchings. Japan isdontinuing to develop raw material sourcesin the inner zone (Japan proper,Korea ManchuriaNorth ina,Formosa and Japanese Sakhalin)in an attempt to achief self-sufficiency butis unlikely to achiefe this goal. She isparticularly dependent on the outer Zone foroil. Her present stocks are estimated atdufficient for about 9 months possibly less.Any other raw materials not available inCatalogue eReterence:xv4/1g inner zone Japan isbelieved to have stock-piles to carry her forlonger periods. Her food supplies are stringentbut not yet critical. Other commodities,e.g.clothing, are deteriorating. On the militaryside Japan has been compelled to adopt thestrategical defensive. She hopes that she maywear the allies out and conclude a satisfac-tory peace. Her Air Force has deterioratedin quality of personnel and her navy hassuffered serious losses. Only her groundforces have maintained their strength andfighting qualities. She will make desperateefforts to resist any allied penetration ofher inner defence line, Japan,Formosa,Luzonand Mindanao.A meeting of the HDE on the subject of renegadestook place last week. The military haveundertaken to hold renegades captured in theirarea. The H.0. have refused to legislate. Ithas however been pointed out to them that bydetaining renegades in a military camp inFrance they will not necessarily escape theodium of the House of Commons. The HomeSecretary may possibly raise the matter in theCabinet.I dined with Walter Bell last night. He tellsme that OSS are recruiting what they considerto be likely German P/WS with the idea ofputting them across the lines as soon as ourforces enter Germany. They want to train theseP/Ws in this country and are anxious that theyshould avoid the LRC. I suggested to Walterthat he should try and persuade OSS of thefutility of such operations. Firstly it isCatalogue Reference:KV/4/195163extremely unlikely that suitable candidateswould be found although quite a number mayvolunteer. They will have to be carefullytrained and to be any use would have to havewireless sets. The average German P/W, havinghad a really difficult time, would eitherreport himself to the nearest German militarycommander or go quietly home. He would havenothing to gin by acting as a traitor to hiscountry,and even if he did operate itisvery unlikely at this stage that he would beable to tell the allied authorities any thingworth while. The probability is that hewould be used for deception by the Germans.Hence no reliance could ever be placed in any- -thing these agents said. The whole thingstrikes me as being typical OSS projectdesigned solely as an attempt to justify theexistance of their organisation.Kliemann of Alst Paris, the spy master ofTreasure and Brutus, has been captured.

There is some ideathat Kliemann had mixed up in the plot tomurder Hitler and that for this reason hethought it better to stay where he was than toattempt to go back to Germany:Catalogue Reference:KV/4/195o4September 25thHorrocks wants to amalgamate B. 4a and F.3 onthe basis that both are dealing with renegades.While this is true, that the emphasis haschanged from espionage to renegades to a cer-tain degree, .4a still nevertheless have togo on dealing with P/Ws who have been incontact with the German I.S. which is solelya interest. apart from this B. 4a dealsentirely with the military and Seymer wouldhave to go on doing this work. Horrocks isI think thinking mainly af a tidy chart.Personally L think that as long as Shelford andSeymer are in close touch, which is nowass red through helford coming up to London,it would be better to leave things as they are.BID/UK are also concerned with renegades thoughmore as a filter than as a section dealing withcases. I have discussed this matter withShelford and Sey mer who appear to be indifferentabout the proposed change. Doth agree thatthe work will have to go on in the same way asbefore.Briscoe and Jimmy Dickson had their partyover the weekend. It was suggested to thevictim whotwas to assist in picking apples thathe would be well-advised to put on an old pairof trousers. This he accordingly did. MeanwhileBriscoe did a bit of high precision work whichshould give us all the deta that we require.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/195osI discussed with Baxter the Information Index.We propose to incorporate certain cards atSHAEF and with the armies in the field plusrecords about spies and collaborationists fromthe U.S.7th Army. The index socompleted willact as a useful check against collaborationistscoming here who wish to evade arrests and forreference by allied governments who are tryingto clear up their various cases on the con-timent. We feel that the index should be keptfor about 5 years and that at the end ofthat period only such cards as have been inaction in the interim should be included inthe main index. This is only a provisionalview since it is difficult at the moment tosee all the uses to which it might be put.Arnold-oster came to see me. He was evidentlyrather perturbed by what he thought was a volte-face by Lick White and Dutler, following whathe thought was an agreed policy. He wanted toknow what had prompted this. I said that Ithought it was pure reflection on the wholequestion. In reality I did not thinkthat ourviews were SO divergent. We arl agreed thatthe present arrangement was unsatisfactoryand that to put it right either Section Vshould come to us or we should go to SIS.Weagreed that total amalgamation would be idealfrom the purely intelligenee point of view butwe were rather appalled by the obstacles thatwe should meet in putting such 'proposal for-ward. I had taken certain soundings and wasquite convinced that in many high quarters anysuch suggestion would be vetoed. What thenwould happen to the scheme. "ould it just beCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19506thrown into the WPB in the same was that hashappened during the last 25 years on everyoccasion when such a proposal has been mooted.I did not gish to prejudice what inmy view wasthe nextbest thing, a division into offensiveand defensive and the abolition of the 3-milelimit. Arnold-Foster seemed to think that theobjections on a high level were not really validand that if we went forward together there wasat least a reasonable change of being cons-idered. I said that this might be so but weshould be up against a very great difficulty ingetting the D. G. to make a serious proposalon these lines. Arnold-Foster went back to hisold arguments that we could not possibly getthe benefits from the SIS machine unless we werepart of it. I said that Ithought this view wasin a way more apparent than real. To my mindthe worst factor of this war had been theruling that we were to conductall our businessthrough Section V instead of talking to thepeople who were actually doing the particularjob in question. A liaison section was allright when an organisation was expanding. Onceit had settled down it could have no meaning.Any representative' could come and see anybodyin this office. The same had never been thecase in the opposite sense. We had always beenforced to deal through a bottle-neck ind not avery good one at that. The result had beenstagnation. We had gradu lly broken this downin a number of ways. For example we had now gotdirect liaison with GC &c CS which had been ofthe greatest value to us and also to them. Allthis seemed to me purely a matter of adminis-tration. What I could understand much moreCatalogue ReferenCe:KV/4/195107easily was the psy chological difficulty ofgetting information out of anybody who handledagents, a.nd that in that sense L could under-stand his arguments. Arnold-Foster did notseem prepared to accept our alternative schemeat any rate in toto. He did not like the ideaof the removal of counter-espionage from SISor of a controlling section put in by us intoSIS to direct the activities of SIS agenciesabroad. He thought this would meet withconsiderable opposition, but precisely why Idid not ascertain. I said that if total amal-gamation were not accepted I felt that ourscheme at least provided more logical divisionof functions than the present arrangements whichwere chaotic. At this stage I had to go toa meeting called by the DG. I told Arnold Fosterhowever that I should like to come over and seehim again this week to continue the discussionand decide precisely how we were to go forwardwith our proposals.The D. G. called a meeting to discuss the D.M.Ispaper on future security requirements. We areagreed that the essential D.R.S should rem in inforce until Stage B. It was merely a metterof their application. If the D.M.I.S requestswere to be fully implemented clearly the 1.0.would have to maintain a more strenuous controlover travel than they at present contemplated.The dangers could however be very largely miti-gated if the government brought pressure uponall neutrals to sever diplomatic relations withthe apanese. This would pretty well hanstringthe Jap I.S. such as it is and make rapidcommunication of information eithe r from hereCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1951or the USA an extremely difficult task.Wedecided to put this view forward and also torecommend that when the chiefs of Staff hadreached their final decision their paper shouldbe discussed by the HDE.September_26tLord Gort came to discuss ISPAL I withKellar. He was anxious that one of his P.A. Sshould be put into the picture. I said 1thought this was highly desirable but since we hahad SO much trouble about this project ofwhich C. .was the custodian I felt that it wouldbe as well for Gort to take the matter up himselfdirect with C. Gort said that he would be goingback to Palestine shortly. He was only heldup on account of the PMs absence. Before leavinghe was anxious to know whether any mattersrelating to the future of Palestine had beenagreed on at Quebec.I attended a meeting of the u.I.C. to discussthe D.M.I.S paper on future security requirementsI said that I thought that if a directiveon thismatter could be obtained from the Chieisof Staff it would be for Sir Findlater Stewartiscommittee to work out the details with the govt.depts. concerned. Meanwhile I thought it wouldbe worth exploring the possibility of bringingpressure to bear on neutrals after Stage A tosever diplomatic relations with Japan. This wouldreduce the security risks by at least 75%.Cavendish-Bentinck wondered whether it would benecessary to expel the ap Embassies or whetherCatalogue Reference:KV/4/195&a withdrawal of their prevelege to use bags andcypher would be sufficient. I said that Ithought it would not since they might quiteeasily get some other power to carry theirtraffic. C. then raised the question of JapB.J.S which of course would cease. He saidthat he would like time to consider whetherthe ntelligencemvalue of these B.J.S outweighedthe security risks.. My own recollection is thatvery few of them are really of value exceptthe Berlin traffic but I have asked Courtney tolook into this. There is also the deceptionangle to be considered. If there are no JapEmb ssies there will be no hannels through whichto pass deception. Cavendish-Bentick thought thawe should have to leave the Jap Embassy inSwitzerland and end we might therefore alsoleave the one in Afghanistan which from thedeception point of view was the most importantsince it controlled the Silver case.We have been asked to prepare a paper showingwhat security measures will be necessary togive effedt to the D.M.I.S paper (a) if theJap Embassies in neutr 1 countries are turnedout and (b) if they are not. We have alsobeen asked to state what the effect of va) or(b) is likely to be on man-power. proposof this I said I did not think there was likelyto be very much difference since travel controlwas being maintained for other reasons as wellas security reasons, and that therefor therequisite personnel would have to be retained.Ne were retaining all the basic DRs untilstageB. It was only a matter of to what degree theyshould be applied.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/195Naumann, Vice-Minister for Propaganda inGermany, has had a conversation with the Japon the various problems with which Germany isnow faced. It wasmade clear that while peacewith England or America was out of the questionGermany Russia, would if a favourable n not t be averse opportunity to peace had with occurred.It was mentioned that Hitler had speciallyrefrained from putting Vlasov's army into thefield as he felt that one he had done SOhe would be unable to get rid of these peopleif the situation suddenly underwent a change.Naumann said that Goebbels,Himmler, Speer andbormann were now in compete agreement as regardsthe conduct of the war and were the personsmainly responsible for its prosecution. Himmlerand Goebbels both were anxious to see Naumann.It appears that Rundstedt has again beenappointed to command the armies in the west.Those on the Germar right wing are under Modeland on the left wing under Blaskowitz. Rundstedtis apparently regarded as a soldier withoutpolitical views.Horrocks, Bird,Kellar and I had a discussionabout the post-war Black List. First of allwe agreed that the main purpose of the listwas firstly to prevent undesirables coming toBritish territory and secondly to give us a clueto the movements of undesirables and the businesscover under which they were working. We thenconsidered the German problem. We felt that themost satisfactory way of dealing with thiswould be if Passport Control in Germany or CCMScould refer all visa applications for Germans togo abroad to this country. It would also becatalogure Refetencukth4figsrocedu Reference.kvi4/i9s tie oprocedure with ourallies. It was suggested that I should discussthis matter vith Jefies. the type cf German whowill be of not interest nill be the ex-Abwehror SD min wao is opening up international traderelations.

If they havean intelligence background they should alsogo on to the world list. It follows from thisthat there is no particular point at thismoment in trying to list any Germans, thattisseprovided the Control ommission or assportControl are prepared to refer back here beforegranting visas.We then passed on to other nationalities.

In assessing whathas happened at Arnhem it was said that on theliability side we had (1) failed to gain theArnhem bridge and (2) suffered very heavy casual-ties, while on the asset side, by holding theplace, especi lly for the last 48 hours, we jadprevented much heavier attacks on our corri-dor and against Nijmegen, where the bridge wedid capture was the most important of all.

Sloaneseemed in very good form and was clearly lookingforward to returning to his native land. Hetalked a great deal about Russia. He thoughtCatalogue Reference:KV/4/195Benes' polidy had been a very wise one He Nasquite certain that Russia had no designs onCzechoslovakia either territorial or in thesense of creating a communist revolution. Stalinrealised that fundamentally the Czechs Nere anti-communist and indivudalist barring a smallclique of intellectuals. He alsorealised thattheir cultur 1 ties were more with the west thanwith the east. Stalin was glad to have friendlyrelations with Czechoslovakia Which heregarded not as a menace to his security butas a link with western Europe. Sloane was wellaare th Stalin was a completely unserupulousman but t king the realist view of the situationhe did not think that Russia would in any wayconstitute a menace to his country. Sloane wassorry for the Poles and he thought thatthey wereextremely ungeschickt in all political matters.They had no able politidal leaders. They alwaysseemed to say the wrong thing at a criticalmoment. Whatever the facts of the (atyn murdersmight be, it would have been much better if thePoles had kept silent. Equally Sosnowski'srecent performance in blaming the British forthe Narsaw situation could not possibly h vebeen more tactless. Sloane was quite sure ththe Russians in taking the Curzon line hadcalculated that it would be difficult for theBritish to argue against it since they had infact created it and what was more importantStalin had calculated that if the Poles could beinduced to take a piece of Germany in compensa-tion it would throw them permanen'tly into thearms of Russia and drive a wedge between themand the Germans for all time.

A.BRASSART & Co. of Berlin, who is inturn a branch of the American concern of thatname. There is also a branch in London. KNIPPINGhas been in Spain about 2 years nd has alsotravelled frequently to Gijon and Oviedo. Heis primarily a technician. The MEW epresenta-tive states that men of this kind hold keypositions in firms for which they work and whenthey become attached to firms in neutralcountries, whether theresis any German capitalinterest or not, the firm's activities arevirtually controlled by them. A considerableinflux of these people is being noted oflate. They are chemists, engineers and labora-tory workers, all working in opanish technicalindustrial concerns where they will be safe fromallied supervision after the war, where they willhave access to equipment enabling them to carryon research work for their German principles andwhere they can plot and plan to their hearts'content.

Two wereapprehended in Leghorn on their way to Naplesto ascertain the preparations of amphibiousoperations against the Ligurian or northAdriatic coast. The case of one of the others,a woman n med Anna SPATA, is of interest asshowing the difficulty of preventing infiltra-tion under refugee cover. SPATA and a malecompanion were despatched on Bth Augustfrom Milan allegedly to report on prepatationsin the ports of -eghorn, Naples and Salerno foran allied landing in the south of France. Theycrossed the lines on the 14th August and regis-tered as refugees at San Casciano. the manthen proceeded to nome where he contacted athird agent who was in fact under allied con-trol. He was accordingly arrested on 28thtugust and interrogated He had not seen SPATAsince they parted at San Casciano. He gave adescription and other details which enabled alliedsecurity agencieis to trace her to alermo whereshe was arrested on the 5th Sept. She had beenevacuated to Scily as a refugee. this is aclear indication of whathappens when there is noLRC machinery and when attempts are made toCuoch spies on a purely catch as catch can basisand without any sy stem of controls.

It is believed that all agents are noweither known or are remaining in hiding, withoutdirectives. At Adana German intelligenceactivities are virtually at an end.September 28thI had a conference this morning with B-W,TARBuster and yourtney. B-W thinks that we shouldput someone permanently into the War Room, sinceothersise he does not see any hope of our gettingwhat we want. I pointed out to him that we hadpreviously had Hart in the War noom but that hecame to the conclusion that there was nothing hecould do to improve the rather lamentableorganisation and apart from that there was verylittle of any importance going into the WarRoom at all. Some weeks ago B-W himself andKim Philby had come wer to tell me that theyproposed to close the War Room down mainly Igathered in order to provide an excuse for gettinrid of the Americans who were hanging roundand were merely an embarrassment. After theyhad gone, something in the nature of a warroom would be re-constituted in the GermanSection. B-W told me that this idea had beenturned down by Helix whose pet babies were theWar Room and the Purple Primers. Meanwhile theWar Room had been staffed to a large extent bypeople who had not the slightestridea what theywere doing, and reports which came in oftenwent astray and were not propoerly distributed.He thought that the only way of meeting thissituation was to have our own man on the spotCatalogue Reference:KV/4/195liwho could tactfully exercise the necessary direc-tion. Buster comphained that practicallynothing came through from the War Room and as faras he could make out there was nothing there.Occasionally a very inadequate wire was receiv edabout an arrest but there was never sufficientin it to say whether it was worth having thebody over or not. He presumed that if a manhad been arrested he must have been interrogatedand that there must be a report somehere.Such reports never seemed to come through.B-W explained the life of an SCI unit in thefield under present conditions. considerableamount jeeps, of getting time was accommodation, spent in getting getting food, in mending touchwith the nearest signals station ete. Once thishad been got over btreams of people were sent tothe SCI unit many of whom were of no importanceand who normaly should be dealt with by theindigenous organisation or by the officerrepresenting the P.Sections, who could rarelybe found. Then a message would be received,as was in fact the case, that a Belgian spy hadcome in with a wireless set. The local policewere not particularly interested in him andhad passed him on to the Air Force Police,who not knowing what to do at told him to gohome and report himself regularly to the policeand in the meantime to keep in touch with theGermans. case of this kind needed a good dealof sorting out. The SCI units were primarilyresponsible to the Army HQ for keeping the areaclean of any spies who were actually operating.Once therefore they had got a man into the collerthey passed on to another area. Buster pointedout tataoguenreferercekv/49yggere atafotgul that not getting thebenefit of any records here which might assistthem to arrest other people within the zone ofthe armies. This was generally admitted. Itseemed clear that what was required was somebodyof the calibre of John Mair to control the SCIunit at the army level. It is presumably toolate now to get anything like this done even ifthe necessary personnel were available. becondLyit seemed desirable that there should be anMI5 officer in Brussels attached to Fapageand one in Paris attached to the 2eme Bureau.There would be ample justification both onmilitary grounds and on grounds of cleaning upour own cases and lastly in order that theremight be someone to handle the cases of Britishrenegades. Meanwhile I think we should, in orderto maintain our rights and possibly get betterservice, put Joe Stephenson into the War Roomif for no other reason than to ascertain whatthe present position is and whether there isanything that could usefully be done. It wasagreed that we should put forward a memo statingour reasons for having someone in Brussels andParis and then consult with Dick about ho' itcould best be put over. Probably the simplestthing would be for the demand to come fromSHAEF. Whichever way we handle it there isbound to be a storm from Felix who will regardthis manoeuvre as the thin end of the wedge.I saw Dick last night. His policy seems to be toget anl the SCI units ready to deal with theGerman problem. This means that unless we haveofficers in Brussels and Faris we shall never beable to give the allied governments the benefitof our records in cleaning up the back areas andCatalogue Reference:KVI4/19521 2lines of communication. Dick has apparentlyhad something of a row with Maunsell, There wasa discussion between Kenneth Strong, maunselland Dick on Sunday, when Dick felt bound topoint out that he thought R.J.S plans for CCMSwere conceived on a far too grandiose scale.Dick's idea is that CCMS should finally establishitself at Army Group and should be receivinginformation from corps and armies.Inthiswayit would gradually build itself up and takecontrol of the whole British area. He thoughtthat this was preferable to going in with a hugeorganisation at the outset. R.U. then accusedDick of being solely interested in the SHAEFaspect of things up till the time of the hand-over. Dick said that this was absurd. He hadno axe to grind whatever and was merely say ingwhat he thought would work out to thebestadvantag in the long run. ersonally I thinkthat Dick is more likely to cut ice with AennethStrong than RJ and there is nothing much towerry aboutPandora discloses that the Irish have receivedan offer from the Germans to exchange one hobertEdward Kingston VERNON and other Irishmenau present under sentence of death for certainpeople whom the Germans propose to name. Pre-sumably this willbe GOERTZ Cc Co. Nothing hascome through officially SO far. I imagine thatthis is just a ramp and that the Germans havepassed sentences of death on these people inorder to bring pressure to bear on us. We shallhave to consider how far it really matters tous at this stage of the war if the various Germanspies in Eire are sent back. Presumably theCatafegue Refererrce:RVia/igem as soon as hostilities12cease, and it may be better to ge T them awayto Germany while the going is good. I doubtif they can do us much harm in the present stateof affairs. On the other hand the precedentof submitting to blackmail is rather a dangerousone and if successful may be extended to coverpeople that we have interned here.John Senter came to see me about Prince WEIKERS-HEIM. I asked him how it was that W. gottaken on by OSS. We seemed to be partly toblame in that we had passed him after vetting.There was nothing really aginst him except thathe was one of those who saton the fence. Hehad previously had connections with the Nazisbut probably owing to the fact that he hadproperty in Germany. He was not however thesort of person whom one would think it wise toemploy since he would obviously later on ask forsome quid pro quo. It had occurred to me aslikely that 30 OSS were employing him to recruitGerman P/Ws to be put back across the line.Senter said he would try and find out Hewould also try and ascertain what OSS policywas with regard to recruiting P/Ws. I said thatif they wanted to bring such people back herewe had no objection provided they kept themunder detention while in this country. On theother hand it seemed to me that such people couldbe of very little value at this juncture. Mostof them were being used for espionage purposesand been given wireless sets, and then desertedback to the enemy, they would constitute a realmeaace. On the other hand if they were beingput across the lines to commit acts of sabotage,they could not really do us any harm. SenterCatalogue Reference:KVI4/19523told me that SOE policy wity regard toGermany had recently been discussed. They toohad been recruiting German P/Ws. It was howeverquiterimpussibde at this moment to get SHAEF toprovide any agents over the line. Germaninternal defences were extremely strong. Werean attempt made at this moment to carry out a thothousand bomber raid on Berlin the estimate wasthat we should lose 150 planes. The may planesthat could carry out such raids were Mos-quitoes. It would be necessary to reduce theenemy's fighter forces considerably beforeextensive raids into the German hinterlandcould be carried out from the western front.Hence the only policy of putting agnets acrosswas to infiltrate them through the lines.Senter then told me that SOE were going tomaintain a small section in Paris for thepurpose of clearing up their own cases. Hewould let me know the results of any investi-gations where we had been interested.A P/W report fro one of the Generals statesthat Goering is completely senile and malicious.TAccording to Rancke, who was ordered toreport to him one day at 2 o'clock, andeventually saw him at 6, "At last when wascalled into the room, Goering was sitting theredressed in the following way: a green silk shirtembroided in gold with gold thread runningthrough it and a large monocle. His hair hadbeen dyed yellow, his yebrows were pencilled,his cheeks rouged. He was wearing violet silkstockings and black patent pumps. He was sittingthere looking like a jellyfish. He nevernever Catalogue rose Reference:KVI4/I but sat in front of him. In2uthat get-up he dismissed me to return tothe front".One of the German generals has stated that V.2could not be adapted to aim at the bridgeheain Normandy because it would have taken fourweeks to alter the position of the launchingsites. The question as to whether this shouldbe done was raised but the decision was givenagainst it.I had a long talk with Arnold-Foster. I said thatI had come to the conclusion that it would beimpossible to get the D.G. to go to the table andargue in favour of one huge united show but thatI myself, and L thought Dick and Richard Butleralso, were all agreed that a united show providedyou could get any body capable of running it onsuch a big scale, was, from the point of view ofthe collection, ollation and distribution ofinformation and action taken upon it, the onlything which would remove the evils of thepresent situation. I should however feel greatdifficulty in going beyond this or in arguingagainst the objections which would be raisedby ministers and in particular by the H.0.who would feel that the absorption of subver-sive movements in an organisation which wasspredominantly an espionage and counter-espionageone might lead to their interests being lostsight of. Another possible objection was that thhead of this vast secret service would have tosome extent to be a public figure. He wouldhave to be personally acquainted with the C.C.Sand also with foreign police and 2eme Bureaux.Foster did not think that this mattered veryCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1952Smuch. lot of care had been taken over thismatter in the past but the representatives offoreign services and their offices were allwell-known and we were practically the onlycountry to endeavour to keep the head of theSecret Service and its location in the back-ground. I said that for practical purposesI did not think it mattered at all but thatsomehow there was an inherent objection in thiscountry to a Secret Service,particularly ifit was not kept strictly in the background.Foster then explained how, if his plans wereagreed, he proposed that SIS,basing itself onG C & C S proposed to carry a great deal of thework of the Service Intelligence Depts. It wouldbe carefully integrated with all availableinformation and be served up on a plate. Adivision of functions between ourselves andSIS would be a reversal of this pattern sincewe were demanding to do our own collation fromthe raw product. I said that we could notreally be classified with the Service IntelligenceDepts. in this matter. Not only were e,likeSI" a producer dept but we had to implementexecutive action by giving advice to govt.depts.in the handling of such information. Fosteragreed and said that it was precisely forthis reason that he thought we ought to be unit edwith SIS, and co-partners in one organisation.n considerable amount of further discussion tookplace at the end of which I suggested that weshould enumerate the points concerning which wewere both a greed:(a we vere both agreed thatthe present situation was unsatisfactory and someimmediate remedy was essential; (b) we feltthat the solution lay either in the SecurityCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1951vService coming in toto to SIS or in Section Vnd Section IK of SIS joining the SecurityService. Foster demurred slightly over thealternative. He wanted to know preciselywhat this would mean. He agreed that weshould have our representatives abroad, forthe purpose of overt liaison.h had alway'sthought we had a very good case for havingsomeone in Washington.

He did not think however thatwe should dictate to stations abroad howthey were to carry out their enquiries.

R.J. is becominga little nasty about this and is beginning tosay that he does not think there is room forhimself and Dick.

After a lengthy discussionwe all agreed that the Argentine was at themoment an extremel bad spot. American relationswith the Argentine were pretty bad. In factwhilst I was in America they had been onthe brink of war. The situation had only beensaved by a decision of the Argentine Govt. toarrest anumber of Germans. Any information thatcame into the hands of the FBI they felt induty bound to pass to the State Dept. mighteasily land up in the hands of the Argentinepolice. The State Department had been prettyunscrupulous in handling information which itthought could be effectively used as a stickwith which to beat the Argentinian Govt.Although the FBI might be willing to helpus there would be andless complicationswhich it would be difficult if not impossiblefor us to control at long distance.

Wickham isextremely knowledgeable about Irish politicsgenerally and I should say would be a greatloss to the Govt. of N. Ireland. He is of coursean Englishman and quite impartial. He would liketo see a united Ireland and thinks that if therehad been one Irish Govt. it would have joined usin the war. While it is possible this is notnecessarily SO that the Irish would join us inany way, and if we gave up N.Ireland we wouldmake ourselves extremely vulnerable.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/195(49October 9thGot back after four days away with a cold.Tin-Eye has got ahead rather too fast with hisplans for moving to Germany.

The 1930Imperial Conference reaffirmed the commonstatus of British subjects. It laid downthat, if any changes were desired in the exist-ing requirements for the cmmmon status,provision should be made for the maintenanceof the common status, and that changes shouldonly be introduced after consultation andagreement among the several members of theCommonwealth. It was for each member of theCommonwealth to definite for itself its ownnationals, but SO far as possible thosenationals should be persons possessing thecommon status, though it was recognised thatCatalogue Reference:KV/4/195150local conditions or other special circumstancesmight from time to time necessitate divergencesfrom this general principal. It was also laiddown that the possession of the common statusin virtue of the law for the time being inforce in any part of the Commonwealth shouldcarry with it the recognixxtion of that statusby the law of every other part of the Gommon-wealth. These conclusions were reaffirmed atthe Imperial Conference of 1937, whichadded that the common status was describedby the term "British subject", by which wasmeant "subject of His Majesty" It was recog-nised however that a distinction existed betweenBritish subjects in general and those Britishsubjects whom they regard as being members oftheir own respective communities. This wouldentitle a dominion like Canada to deport aBritish subject who was not a Canadian. Althoughit has never been done a similar distinctioncould be made by the U.K. This has not SO farbeen the practice and legislation would benecessary if any variation was contemplated.So far as Eire citizens are concerned, theprincipal exceptions to the rule that theirtreatment is exactly the same as that ofBritish subjects belonging to the U.K. are nowas follows: (1) National Service. Eire citizensare not liable to section 11 of the U.K.Nat.Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939 (which followsthe corresponding provision of the MilitaryTraining Act 1939). this only applies hoeverif they are not ordinarily resident in GreatBritain. By the term ordinarily resident ismeant resident in Gt Britain for less than2 years or ffrthey can show that the circum-stances of their residence are for temporaryCatalogue Reference:KVI4/195ISTIpurposes only. Other members of the Empire(exeept .Ireland and the Union of S.Africa)are liable after 3 months residence.Aninformal arrangement was made in March 1940with the Eire High Commissioner that wherehe would give a certificate that a man had ahome in Eire the man could be allowed to leavebefore the date of calling-up on the understandithat he could not return here except formilitary seervice. As regards generalservice it is likewise permissable for Lirecitizens to return to their own country as analternative to registering under the NationalService Act. This has been extended to regis-tration under the Registration for EmploymentOrder, and the issue of directions to employmentunder DR. 58a. In the latter case the direetionsare issued, but the worker concerned is given thopportunity to return to fire before proceedingsare instituted (2) Travel into and out of UK.The Prevention of Violence Act 1939 permits incertain cases the making of an expulsion orprohibition of entry order against persons int.Britain who have not been ordinarily residentin t.Britain for the last 20 years (or theirlifetime if less than 20 years). Registra-tion with the police orders may also be madewithout restriction as to the period in whichthe person concerned has been ordinarily resi-dent in Gt.Britain. Eire citizens who areBritish subjects are not treated as aliensin this country,e.g. for registration purposes.It is however the case that under the PassengerTraffic order of June 9th 1942, a Britishsubject entering t.Britain from Ireland (northor south) may be R.L.L. and returned whence hecame Catalogue or alternatively, Reference:KV/4/195 landing be subjec-5ted to conditions as to length of stay in ut.Britain, occupation or employment therein orregistration or notification of his particu-lars. This has been employed in practice tolimit the duration of a stay in this countryto 6months to prevent change of occupationwithout notifying the M/L and to force applica-tion tonthe police for an extension of permissioto remain here for a longer period than 6months. It should however be noted thatnone of these provisions are directed t Eirecitizens as such. they apply to all Britishsubjects who enter Gt.Brit in from Ireland.3. Allegiance. Special consideration has beengiven to the position of Eire citisens inrelation to the condition which it is proposedto impose on Germany that she should hand overto the United Nations any of their nationalsfor whose surrender they may ask on the groundof activities during the war inimical to theirinterests. The conclusion reached has beenthat while each case must be considered onits merits, there can be no objection tothe K.Govt. demanding the surrender of anyBritish ubject who is also an Eire citizenif it is clear that before the war he had asubstantial connection with the U.K. or thathe had maintained no substantial connectionwith Eire.have been reading Commander Coxis report toPeter Reid's committee on wireless deceptionand security measures broadcast by the 3 serviceprior to Overlad @ Neptune. There is no doubtthat the wvavy and to a lesser degree the otherServices, have done a very fine job. They basedCatalogue Reference:KV/4/195183their work on the assumption that the enemylistening-posts being favourably establishedfrom Norway to the south of France, all signalswould be monitored with comparative ease.Having made a careful study of our own signalsour which own incidentally security, they assisted knew exactly in tightening the type upand volume of traffic to put across if theywished to create the impression in the minds ofthe enemy monitoring service that a forceexisted in a particular place and was likelyto be used for a particular purpose. this workinvolved amongst otherthings what was known as"finger-printing". Certain ships have certaintypes of wireless the waves from which whenphotographed are of a distinctive type. Equallyan operator's touch can be photographed in sucha way as to identify with almost certaintyany operator who has any peculiarity in histransmissions. the more skilled the operatorthe more likely he is to have idiosyncrasies.although the science of finger-printingdemonstrates clearly how units and theirlocation can be identified through theiroperators, it also provides a valuable means fordeception. When planning an operation it isessential that those who plan the wirelessdeception should be in right at the start,since it is necessary to get the enemy accustom-ed to certain signals and to a certain volumeof signals during the varios stages of thetraining period. It is quite possible for aclever monitoring service to work out precise-ly to what point training has actually devel-opedand what the lifting power of any par-ticular force is likely to be. For the purposeCatalogue ReferenCe:KV/4/195of Neptune two entirely bogus assault forcesV. and W. with their associated ships andcraft were created by wireless in the clydearea early in April and were maintained thereuntil the end of May. ns the result of thismanoeuvre not only did the enemy retain hisforces in Norway but actually reinforced them.The second part of the cover plan was soclosely related to the actual operational planthat in its later stages it should beregarded as tactical. Its intention was, asthe amount of activity in the south becameincreasingly apparent, to induce the enemyto anticipate the main attack in the area ofthe Pas de Calais and eastward from there.This deception plan was launched beforeNeptune and its intention persisted afterthe Neptune assault which was thus to beregarded by the enemy as a large diversionaloper peratio ation. A completely bogus Force F. wascreated and maintained by wireless on theeast coast. This force, the groups of whichwere at first situated between armouth andHarwich and later moved south, was heard towork up and trained with elements of theFirst Army Group. Tor the benefit of enemyrecce planes there were dummy landing crafttank, and eventually a stand-by headquartersship. Further to reinforce this threatconsiderable effort was put into giving theFree Neptune iaval wireless traffic a south-eastern bias, particularly by increasing theimportance of Dover and the Nore and ofHarwich. A special broadcast consistingentirely of dummy traffic was initiatedfromChatham. By D day it had been so arrangedCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/195tha activity round the principal headquartersthere was greater than usual. In the eastand south-east it was increasing. In thesouth it had decreased. In support of the-main assault two inter-service diversionaryoperations were planned to lead thetenemyto expect landings in the Boulogne area(Operation Glimmer) and in the Fecamp-d'Antife:area (Operation Taxable). The notional H hourof these oper tions was about 3 hours beforethat of the real assault. On the naval sidethe main contribution was made by variousradar counter-measures and sonie devices.These were arranged to give the enemy's radarthe impression shipping appropriate to theassault forces approaching each target area.On the 12-13th June it was required by thegeneral army tactical plan that the enemyshould retain troops on the west of theCourtentin peninsula instead of moving themto oppose the US forces moving over fromtheir original assault area. In order togive the enemy some reason for hoiding histroops as desired, wireless traffic indicativeof an assault force moving in towards thevoast north of Granville was transmitted fromtmo destroyers that were routed so that theforce appeared to be coming in south of Jerseyearly in the morning of June 13th. It is notat the moment possible to say what the enemyassumptions on this traffic was.Itiscertainhowever that his troops were not moved, whichwas the result desired.There has been a broadcast on the 22nd Sept.by talogumpereRencedof4rigs Coy. with someinteresting evidence of the effect of ourdeception for Overlord. Matthew ralton, ofC.B.CC had been studying the captured trans-scripts of telephone conversations betweenthe German Generals during the first monthof the invasion. The first conversation was onthe morning of June 6th, two hours after theallied landings ad begun. Gen.Marx, speak-ing to the Chief of Staff, said he urgentlyrequested mobile reserves for the areawest of Caen. The Chief of Staff in replyingstates that Hitler himself orders that thebridgehead shall be completely anrinilatedby the night of June 6th "because there isdanger of additional sea and airborne landingsin other areas". On the 8th June nommelgiving instruetions to his commanders toprevent a junction of the bridgeheads andthe capture of Cherbourg states that he isexpecting larger landings in the Calais andBoulogne area in a few days. He thoughtour landings in Normandy Nere perhaps notmuch more than a feint. Commanders in thefield were calling day after day for supportwhile the High Command saved the reserves incase of new landings until it was too late.Hitler entered the picture several times a weelin person and always said the same thing:"There must be no retreat. Every man mustfight and fall where he stands rather than givean inch of ground". Complaints were madeall the time by the forward forces of theenemy that they had no air support and that ourbombing prevented them from concentratingany where for counter-attack.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/195FHIS IS CORYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958 Mos 200Civil Affairs report of 20th Sept. refers tovertain towns in Germany which were the firstto come under allied occupation.

Cussen'spaper on bringing the terms of the OfficialSeerets Act to the notice of all retiringofficers who had had access to confidentialinformation was discussed. Apparently Bridgesthinks that a friendly letter is Likely to bemore effective than the signing of a document.Cussen and I maintain that probably both werenecessary. The thing would have to be donevery much on an individual basis and the methodadopted to the type of rerson concerned. Itwas astonishing however how ignorantpeople were (a) about the penalties which theymight incur and (b) about the harm that ean bedone through talking about confidentialmatters even after the war. Many of themthink that once the war is over they can saywhat they like. This of course if very farfrom being the case, where the security oflong-term sources and method S is of thegreatest importance.Catalogue Rhe other discussed was the D.M.I.S1paper on future requirements of militarysecurity. Nobody seemed very clear as towhat was wanted. The D.M.I. had not read thepaper which had been drafted by Peake on hisbehalf, and passed the buck to Larry Allen.-E said that I thought that if the chiefs ofStaff made a clear statement as to what theywanted to keep secret it would very muchstrengthen the hands of the Security Serviceand of the Dervice Depts infighting theirbattles with the H.O. whose tendency was topull the whole fabric to pieces bit by bit.If we could say that it was the instructionsof the Chiefs of Staff that certain informationwas to be withheld from the enemy and thatunless certain restrictions were maintainedtheir wishes could not be carried out, itwould make a considerable difference.
