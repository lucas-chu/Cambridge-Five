The agentsemployed were mostly members of pro-GermanFascist parties. Since Mid-December 21parachute agents have been arrested and afurther 11 are believed to be at large. Themajorityare saboteurs with fuel sabotigemissions. The 150th panzer brigade,witan estimated strength of 1-2,500 in Americanuniforms aind 300 american vehicles includingtanks, has been engaging in harrassing tacticsin support of the German offensive Under thecommand of this brigade is a unit known asEinheit Stielau, with an estimated strengthof 120 to 150 Lnglish-speaking Germans, person-nel recruited by Skorzeny. The Stielau unithas been used in small jeep parties whereit nas probably intended for work on the nearesdefences from the German lines, where linguis-tic abilities and false identity papers weremore likely to be accepted. The principlesabotage ebjectives appear to have been theMeuse bridges. So f far 13 of the Stielau unithave been captured and 12 killed. Despiteorders to this effect it is now evident thatvery few arms have been surrended by members ofthe rench Resistance groups. Three membersof a ranco-Beigian arms smuggling gangoperating across the Franco-Belgian frontierhave een arrested. A captured letter fromJacques Doriot gives plans of P.P.F. Thereis ample evidence to show connection betweenPPF and the G.I.S. and much use has alreadybeen made of its members for S S. work.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/196J.I.C. have written a paper on the recentGermar offensive. It is believed that it ispart of a ran conceived as early as Sept. 1944for the purpose of restoring confidence to theGerman people and demonstrating to the alliesin the west and to the USSR that German powersof resistence are still formidable. They mayalso hope that by ensuring a striking defeatof the allies to increase war-weariness anddissension among them. Finally thoughtsceptical about the possibility of any compro-mise he may feel that a big victory wouldstrengthen his position if it came to bargain-ing with one or other of the allies. Early inDecember the Germans had succeeded in stabil-ising their position without the employment oftheir strategic reserves. They had to face thepossibility of a further attack in the westand also a major Russian offensive as soon asthe ground hardened in January. To meet thislatter offensive they might have to call onthe strategic reserves now situated in the vestConsequently it would be natural for theGermans to attempt to prevent simultaneousAoffensives on the east and west. In view ofthe conditions on the two fronts, an attemptcould only be made by a spoiling offensive inthe west. hundstedt would probably haveagreed to this strategy provided the attack wasnot pressed dangerously far. The fact thatall avail ble German aircraft in the west andalmost all the armoured reserves are beingbrought into the battle suggests that Hitleris striving for some really big success. SHAEFappreciate that the immediate objectives areCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1966the Meuse bridges between Liege and Huy withother columns pushing out to one line of theMeuse between Huy and Givet and into Luxem-bourg to prtect the flank and rear Of the mainattack. In SHAEFs view Liege cannot be usedby the allies for the maintenance of theirforces in the Aachen salient. Their powerof renewing the offensive in that area wouldbe greatly reduced even if they were notforced to evacuate the salient. it is notthought likely that the Germans can maintainthe offensive for more than a fortnight unlessthey capture large quantities of petrol. Rund-stedt would therefore wish to avoid placing hisforces in a dangerous position. li counter-attacked he might decide to witndraw gradually,sure of having dislocated the allies plansand having denied them many of the resources Wwhich they have acquired in the past feN monthsIf however the Germans gain a major successHitler might demand exploitation bey ond whatthe OKW would consider sound strategy.Deeemeer 2ndhobson-Scott asked me about the possibilityof the Czechs being allowed to interrogateNAUJOCKS.

They are both regarded as honest-minded people who if in disagreement withBritish policy vis a vis Germany would nothesitate to say so.Horrocks,TAR, Herbert, bert,Buster,Bir and myself hada meeting about the War Room. I was anxiousto ascertain definitely whether Horrocks wasprepared to bear the responsibility of carry-ing the records. There was an immense amountof irrelevant talk which all of us foundextremely diffialt to follow. Thuerreersindeone positive complaint, namely that R.B. wereat present doing the same look-ups over andover again. Information on these look-upswas submitted to the field but there was nothingto show what the field already had or to preventa further look-up on information which wasalready in their possession. he explained thatthis was due to the general War hoom sy stem fromwhich we suffered quite as much if not morethan the RB registry. It was hoped to get thisright when the directing staff were appointed.Horrocks then expressed some doubt as towhether we had a charter to card recordswhich related to the eleaning up of Germanintelligence agents on the continent. I saidthat this was the whole purpose of the reorgan-isation of the B registry and that this had beenagreed long before D. Day. 1 then asked for adefinite assurance that he would carry therecords from the field if it was finally agreedthat they should be based on our registry.We had all been proceeding on this assemptionCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1961but if there was any doubt about it I shouldlike to know now. I said that it would beextremely humiliating if we had to go to SISat this stage and say that we could not do thejob. Horrocks at once said that there was noquestion of this at all, that he would certainlydo the job provided it was confined to SD andAbwehr and did not include all undergroundmovements in Germany including the Nazi PartyThere followed some explanation of the functionof EDS, about which Horrocks was evidently inthe dark. He had never seen the records him-self but understood and I think wrongly under-stood, certain things he had heard from Potter.The position at EDS is that.ti there were some60,000 cards, of which 20,000 have been receivedfrom the War woom and relate to purely CE mattersAs far as the War room is concerned, EDS ismerely the sausage machine reproducing cardssupplied to them and circulating the to the fielAdam rang me up about a proposal to run a lineof spanish ships from Spain to Caen. These.ships are to anchor off Falmouth and proceedthence under convoy. This arrangement isnot very satisfactory as it provides a meansfor the Germans to send their agents fromSpain to France. We know already from MSS thatthey are aying plans to get agents across theFranco-Spanish frontier, and to dump them byship. We are also afraid that if we allowthese ships to go to France it may create aprecedent for opening up a Spanish line to thiscountry. The ships are apparently to carry acargo of certain Spanish ores which are requiredby the French. I said that SHAEF ought to beCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19613fullyzacquainted with thefactsbefore theygive a final decision.

It isalso definite that the organisatiol will notoperate abroad except under C's direction andcontrol.I then asked Peter what had happened about theenquiry by Bridges into counter-espionage or therelations between ourselves and Section V. Hesaid that the Secretary of State had receivedreplies from all the Ministers who had beenasked for their views about such an enquiry.The Admiralty and the Air Ministry had agreedto Bridges doing the job, the 1.0. had suggestedthat the financial and organisational heads ofthe Treasury should form a committee withBridges, but that the W.0. had said that theirSecretary of State and the CIGS were of opinionthat such an enquiry would not be likely toachieve the desired results and might do harm.Grigg wished to discuss the matter with Eden.o far it had not been possible to arrange sucha discussion but it had been decided thatCadogan should see Grigg about the matter onTuesday next. We know that Grigg is set onFindlater Stewart conducting the enquiry andit may be that he isdesirous of pressing hisview on this point and that he does not thinkthat Bridges will have the time to go into thematter in sufficient detail. F.O. are proposingto reply to Morrison to the effect that as theCatalogueReference:kVI4/196 Catatoguesome weeks he doubtswhetherthe Financial Secretary and the Organisa-tional Secretary of the Treasury will be ableto give the necessary time but should theirservices be required Sir Edward Bridges willbe glad to call upon them. In fact they won'tbe required.I told Peter about the discussions with Arnold-Foster and of my fears against presenting aproposal for mass fusion. I told him of mysuggestion that we should have a co-ordinatinghead on a working level who would reorganisethe two services on offensive and defensive linethat both services should be put into one build-ing and that the registries should be linkedand the personnel should be inter-changeable.Lastly I mentioned the suggestion that thejoint organisatior should second certain per-sonnel to Service Intelligence Depts. Peterseemed to think that this was a good ideaand agreed with me that if you got the twoorganisations into the same building withtheir records linked, half the trouble would beover. He was also confident that mass fusionwould not be likely to be acceptable to thepowers that be. I pointed out to him thatcomplaints had been raised about over-lappingand lack of co-ordination. It was thereforedifficult for the authorities to complain abouta suggestion that there should be a co-ordinatorI told Peter that in putting forward this ideawe thought that it was right onganisationallybut that we nevertheless did it with certainmisgivings since we had no sort of guaranteethat all the hopelessly dead wood in SIS wouldCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196be removed. Wehad a pride in our show andwe note of us wished to find ourselves servingunder Sir Claude Dansey, Lousy Paine, MosesBeddington, Col. V or anyone else. We took thelowest possible view of them and of the organ-isation. He seemed to think that this outburstwas reasonable.Lastly 1L came to the somewhat delicate subjectJohnnie Dashwood, Will Codrington and theF.U. Security Service.COPYoosCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196wTHIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION(4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958.Co000Thesame reasoning applied in the case of theleakage at Ankara. the safe had bee opened morethan 2 ye ars and 8 months ago and Knatchbull-Hugessen's important documents had appeared onISOS. There were various theories about howthese things had happened but in fact nobodyknew. We had not even been told about theincident officially. Ne had just learnedlittle snips nere and there. Hed we beencal led in we should have sent out somebodywith a knowledge of secret sources, oussen anaBurt and should have not abandoned the caseuntil we had tried every possible means afdiscovering the cuprit. Apart from this wehad a general interest in knowing when leakagoccurred. Wie might be looking for someindividual here when in fact he was in Stock-holm, Lisbon, madrid or elsewhere. It might bethat there were no such cases but in any casewe were never told about them if there were.All this arose I thought from an incident whichoccurred several years ago when Cussen and Burthad interviened the P.M. cook on a leakagecase. For some reason or other Will odringtonhad intervened and insisted on being present.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19621He kept breaking into the interrogation and soembarrassed Burt and Cussen that they had toask him to desist. Ever since he had been hos-tile to this dept. and extremely cagy about allsecurity matters affecting the 1.0. I thinkPeter sees the point of all this but I doubtif he is in a position to do much about it.The D.GI talked to me today about the War Room.He wants me to go and see "C". I showed himDick's letter. He is quite agreeable to TARrunning the War Room if he is acceptable to "C".I had a lk with Herbert about O.C. e proposof a file on Gib. which apparenty he has neverseen. It relates to the personality of theGovernor, the general state of the colony andthe possibility of an invasion from La Lineaif civil war once more started in Spain.It seems to me that all these are matters onwhich the B.division officer dealing with Gibshould be informed. Lastly there is a statementin a JIC paper relating to the possibilitiesof sabotage which has never been passed to usat all.took this opportunity to discuss the generalquestion with Herbert. He seemed to thinkthat something on the lines of 0.C. was necess-ary although he saw the dangers in Ede's caseof the administration becoming top-heavy. Hesays that provided you have somebody who hasnot got too grandiose ideas and is quite pre-pared to tell Governors that he is not qualifiedto speak on Intelligence matters, the systemCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19629should work well. He certainly thinks that itis important that Governors should be enter-tained and that our own DSOs should have thefeeling that someone was looking after theirwelfare. Policy matters he thinks should befor joint discussion.At the 12 o'clock meeting today Hart and Bustergave an account of the man calling himselfDIECKENHOFF who has been arrested by the >hef-field police and who alleges that he is aparachute spy. Both uerbert and Buster areconvinced that he is not a spy in the ordinarysense, namely a man trained by the Abwehr or SDand sent here on a special mission. They areinclined to think that he isa Belgian, possiblya deserter or a criminal. Herbert thinks he isa murderer. He has long ape-like arms andlargehands.Herbert feels that he could onlyput forward the theory that he is a spy if he hacdone something worse. DIECKENHOFI has saidnothing that in any way corresponds to the normalform of spies as we know them.Infacthehassaid several things which lead us to think thathe has never had anything to do with theGIS in his life. It is thought that he ispossibly a Belgian racing cyclist who was hereseveral years before the war. An attempt isbeng made to get him identified. It is almostcertain that he has give a fdase name.

His main object was toemphasise that/the unions would not be witingto alter their rules but would be prepared toaccept and adjust themselves to general govt.policy covering the employment of aliens.Herbert has produced a memo on the present trendsof the Abwehr in Belgium and he reaches thefollowing conclusions:( the Abwehr stay-behindorganisation of espionage agents has beenrendered or become almost wholly ineffectivealthough (a) approximately 29 W/T operators havenot yet been identified as captured (b) at least4 uncontrolled agents made transmissions sincethe liberation of Belgium, one at least as lateas November. The single most important measurein rendering the st y -behind organisation in-effective has been the arrest of known collab-orators since the Abwehr drew their stay -benindCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19616agents very largely from members of these or-ganisations.

After the dissolutioof the Abwehr, the Brandenburg division whichfrom the beginning had always been closelyCatalogue Reference:KVI4/19627associated with Abwehr II, passed unde r thecontrol of the Wehrmachtfuhrungstab of the OKW.At about the same time the 5th Lehrregiment ofthe division was placed under direct orders ofAbt.

He rather agrees with my view that agood deal of the work can be done better inits own environment. It is fair to say howeverthat he is not very keen about a large build-up in this country as he thinks that ultimatelythe schwerpunkt for C.I. work should be inGermany rather than here. I told him that Iwas not in entire agreement because I thoughtthat it would probably always be necessary tosome extent for the Control Commission to throwthings back here. Obviously they would referless ind less as they built up their ownrecords. There would also be a large numberof cases which would be of purely local signi-finance and which would therefore not be worthrecording.

I askedhim whether any attack was expected on.the Maas.He said that the Germans had planned to launchan attack there in February but he did not atthe moment know whether they wou.ld be able tocarry this out or not.th JanuaryI have ascertained from Montagu that thesubmarine previously reported to be carryingan agent to Canada is identical with the onewhich landed two saboteurs in the USA recently.We are informing Cyril Mills.I attended a meeting of the JIC at which decep-tion in the Far East was discussed. Bevanwanted W/T backing but the Admiralty and Igather the other Services as well had been unablto supply the necessary personnel. Apparentlythose units who have been trained for the Over-lord period had been disbanded owing to short-age of man-power, and drafted to varioushships.I said that from our experience nere we werequite convinced that it was useless to try anddo deception without wireless backing. Itcould only result in throwing agents down thedrain. It was decided to inform SEAC of theposition and also I think to report to theChiefs of Staff.I then raised the question of the Chinese BJswhich seemed to me to have a bearing on decep-tion in the Far East It would be difficult tocarry out any useful deception unless it werepossible to block the Chinese leak. Messageshad been going from this country for some timeCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19632showing the disposition of our ships. Thesemessages were either broken by the Japs orpinched in Chungking. The D.I.I said that hewas glad this matter had been raised as it wascausing him considerable anxiety. There seemedlittle doubt that the Chinese N.A. obtained hisfacts from some 50 Chinese naval students whowere working with the Fleet. He did not seehow these officers could be withdrawn withoutcreating a serious incident. We then sug-gested that the document captured in the FarEast which showed that the Japs h ad beenreceiving information sent from London byChinese attaches, might be pepped up and thenused for the purpose of making a demarche tothe Chinese.

Elaborate deception plans had beenworked out. Some engineers had been going intothe camp daily in order to lay dyrain-pipes inthe vicinity of the huts.

It seemed likely that theControl Commission would take over the respon-sibility for the War room after the SHIAEF periodOn the other hand the War hoom as such mightbe abandoned. He was also interested in C'sreservations about SHAEF control. He thoughtthere should be SHAEF control not only of theWar Room but also bf the SCI units as atpresent.

The circumstances wereas follows: Templer had got into touch withthe Danish Resistance Movement for the purposeof getting them to run a show into Germany. Inthis he had been successful. Unfortunatelyhowever one of them named Nordentoft wasacquainted with the arrangement and talked abouthis associated with Templer to PETERSEN inStockholm. PETERSEN suggested that he too mightbe able to help Templer in a similar way, andsuggested that he should come over for adiscussion. I said that provided the propo-sition was considered really important Idid not think we should have any ob jection inprinciple to PETERSEN being sent to this country.There would be a certain security risk but nota very gr ve one. I asked Templer what heknew about PETERSEN. He said that he had had atalk with C. and with Dunderdale who was goingto talk to Garno of the Polish Secret Servicewho had had dealings with ETERSEN in the past.As far as he knew PETERSEN had been rather onthe fence in the early days of the war,i if hehad not in fact given, the Germans a certainCatalogue Reference:kVi4/196(7amount of information and assistance. uatterlyhowever he is said to have been extremelywell disposed towards ourselves. 1 pointedout to Templer that if he wasaccepting PETERSEN'offer he was laying himself open to beingdouble crossed on a big scale. If he suppliedmoney to finance PETERS N'S projects in Germanyhe would never know the value of the reportsthat he received. Moreover PETERSEN might wellgive away the whole show to the Germans andtake money from both sides. The worst aspectof the situation was that as far f r as I could seehe would never have any means of knowing pre-cisely where he stood.

I todhim roughly what were the views of the variousparties on the War Room and where thoughtthere might be snags. SHAEF have apparentlyveen rather standing on their heads since Rund-stedt's attack. There is no doubt that theAmericans were caught completely on the hop.They have had some 40,000 casualties including18,000 missing. They had created no adequatedefences and their staff work generally seemeto have been bad. The redeeming feature wasthemagnificent way in which they had fought atBastogne.

He expressedbitter resentment at the suggestion that Montyshould take over the two American armies. Thissuggestion was mainly sponsored by KennethStrong and Jock whiteley,who are the only peoplewith any field experience. The move was aperfectly natural one. The line had beenbroken and it was obviously better to haveMonty take over the northern part p of the salientand Beadley the south. Feeling generally israther bad. The Americans dislike us, the Frencldislike the Americans, and are generally try ingto drive a wedge between them and ourselves.De Gaulle threatened to withdraw his troopsfrom the line if Strasburg was not defended.Eisenhower had to respond to this piece ofblackmail.

This ended witha meeting C illed by the D. G. which TAR, Horrocks,Buster, butler, Dick, Harker and myself attended.Horrocks took the line that the Section .cardswere not nearly SO bad as they had been painted,that they contained quite a lot of information20f of which was not recorded on our files. Forthis he must have been relying on the statementsof Section V. Buster pointed out that a good de ilof this 205 consisted o1 Gestapo records whic'were nouin fact relevant to the work of thear thoom. Horrocks questioned whether in accor-dance pith our present charter we had any rightto card in our files a lot of inform tion regard-ing S.D. and Abwehr which in theyfuture wouldhardly concern this dept. but only the Germansection oi Section V. the D.G. was inclined totake a similar vie. It was pointed out howeverthat what we vere really rying to do was to servCatalbuetRefeferceskvamgstage. None of us,not even members of Section V. themselves had-s9been able to get any satisfactory results fromtheir registration system and it had beengenerally recognised that our registry was theonly one on which the documents could be based.It will obviously take many months to buildup the existing SIS sy stem into any thing likeefficiency since it would have to be convertedfrom an information card system to a file sy stemIf and when this was completed we shouid havetwo registries more or less covering thesame ground, since we would never ourselvesrefrain from doing a considerable amount ofcarding of foreign names on the ground that tocombat the German Intelligence sy stem it wasessential for as to have a comprehensive ideaof its workings in all parts of the world andstudy the reports in the raw. The only realsolution was of course an amalgamation of sectioV. and ourselves or a total amalganation of SISand MIS. One of the best methods of bringingthis about (although this is an idea with whichi do not feel that the DG is in sympathy) wasto create an approach through absorbing theSIS records in R B. and giving SIS free accessto RB in the same way that they gave us freeaccess to the ISOS Index It was eventuallyagreed that TAR and Horrocks between them Sshould try and put this view across and getSIS to agree to the assimilation of the Warroom cards into R.B.20th January 1945.I saw Peter at the Club. I asked him what hadbeen the result of the conversation betweenCadogan and Grigg a propos of the enquiry intothe relations between ourselves and Section V.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/196GoHe said that Grigg had been worried aboutBridges conducting the enquiry since his absencewould undoubtedly have come to tne notice of thePM who would have anted to know all about itand moreoever he felt that as much of thematerial was very delicate,particularly HogerHollis's work, it would berdesirable to havepapers relating to the enquiry floating aboutin Downing St. where they mignt be seen by theBeaver. He thought it would be infinitelypreferable if the enquiry were conducted bysomebody who was away from abinet Secretariatcircles. In this connecteon indlater Stewarthad been suggested though no final decisionhad been reached. Peter inclines to the viewthat any thing in the nature of total amalgama-tion will not be acceptable although it may bedesirable. I said that in my experience oncethings of this sort reached Cabinet levelit was the toss of a coin whether they wentright or wrong. Peter entirely agreed andmentioned off the record the atmosphere inwhich S.0 E.S future was being discussed. Therehad been several minutes by Eden and by theChiefs of Staff and the apers hadcome up tothe PM at the end of a rather tiring day.He had written across them "Let Major Mortonlook into this and advise.

On his first, for whichhe had been dropped by parachute in SouthItaly, he had made his way nathwards byvarious means collecting information n-the-way,CaatalogureRefepence*v/4/t9e and interrogated. HeHe told the story that he was endeavouring tojoin his family in South Marino and he wasaccordingl. released. Possibly being short ofmoney, he obtained employment in a Britishofficer's mess where he worked as a waiter fora week and duly received his wages. He thenobtained his release by sa ing that he wassuffering from malaria, and proceeaea on hisway to join the Germans.AA section V report referring to the Italianfront states that two agents were arrestedin Rome who have peen transmitting since lastJune. They were a German serviceman, a Luft-waife sergeant and W/T operator, and a privatewho gathered the intaligence. These men wereinstalled in a flat in Rome at the beginning of1944. They took good security precautions,working entirely on their own. Their arrestresulted directly from the sending of a courierto them. The courier was an Italian who wasdropped near Rome and who promptly surrendered.He subsequently kept a rendez-vous with the twoagents who were immediately arrested.Another agent has started operating in Naplesand one in Florence and have not SO far beenlocated. Owing to the absence of ISOS informa-tion it is not pparently possible to assessthe line-crossing situation. A smaller numberof arrests have been made recently. OneFascist Republican line-crosser has,accordingto a captured agent, completed 5 operationsand set out on a 6th on Dec.20th. Air opera-tions are again on the increase. It is knownthat 10 agents at least were dropp ed duringthe month of December. All haye peen accountedfor except one. In addition a reliable sourcereports the parachuting of 5 W/T agents inthe Pesaro area and that the numper of agentsready for parachuting in the near futureCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19666is between 50 ana 60. A total of 45 agentshad been arrested between 17t th Dec.and lIthJan. The general impression given from theabove is that C.I. is somewhat Lax in Italy.It is of course aue to the iaat that Hill-Dillon has never established the proper con-trols. He has a far easier frontier to control than SHAEF has in the west.The JIC have considered the possible use ofchemical wariare py the Germans.

The routine for gaspre earedness has een energetically maintainedand even slightly step ed up which conformswith either offensive or defensive intents.General strategic factors do not show anyimmediate likelihood of the initiation of gaswarfare by the enemy but a turn of eventson lines in favour of the allies either inthe east or west would produce a situationin which the use of gas by the Germans wouldhave to be egarded as possible. Germanpreparation for gas wariare justify closeand constant watch aainst a move of whichtheir mightbe little warning.January 25thV.2 is continuing on an average of 12 to every24 hours and on one day reached the recordfigure of 16.

Cammaerts saidthat he too had given the undertaking which vermuch streng thened the whole case. In anyevent however he thought that owing to Chris-timet noble action her wishes Should perespected, even though she was not a Britishsubject. Senter wanted to get WAEM over herefrom Bari. We felt however that there wasnothing to be gained and that the H.0. mightdecide to deport him to Belgium against hiswishes. We thought that he should either goback to Belgium of his own accord on theunderstanding that we should make strongrepresentation on his behalf or that SOEwould use him in the Far East in accordancewith his wish to serve the British and Sopurge his ofence. If he agrees to do thishe could go direct from Bari to Burma. Hewould obviously be a great embarrassment tous here.I went to see nci this afternoon to ask himabout the ease OI MARCUS. He told me that inNov.last MARCUS had come through the lines asa Volkssturn aeserter. He had peen interro-gated by the French but said that he wishedto see the British. The French, either becausthey did not want to pass him to us or moreprobably through sheer negligence, left himmore or less loose in Paris. We eventuallyheard about him through the Chinese MA whoinformed our MA. MARCUSS story was that hecame with a special mission From JAHNKE whois now working Work in close touch with SCHELLEN-BERG. JAHNKE might conceivably be gettingout to Switserland Ior consultation about aplan to dislocate industry at the moment ofthe British invasion of Germany. Foley wasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19619sent over to Paris to interrogate this manana said that he haa a lot of valuable informa-tion about the SD and should in any case bebrought to this country. A flap then startedin SIS as the felt it was necessary to getthe FO,if not the PMS, sanction for bringinga man to this country who was prepared tocooperate with us in a plan of this kind.Somehow or other it seems to have got associa-ted in people's minds with a peace proposal.There is no reason as far as I can see whythe case should not have been treated ina perfectly normal manner. However, the author]of both Eden and the PM, the latter ratherreluctantly, was obtained. The French then saicthat they would only allow the man to come hereif he was accompanied by a French officer whoshould be present at all interrogations. Itwas under these conditions that MARCUS wasbrought over. C. I think had taken it forgranted that we had been told about the wholething but in any case made no mystery apoutit and was perfectly willing for us to begiven copies of all papers. I then pointedout to him that there might be a ratherinteresting tie-pp with the ola case ofJAHNKE and FLETCHER. I also remindea him ofKREVITSKY' associated with JAHNKE. C. thentold me that in order to avoid any possibilityOI the Russians getting to hear about thisand thinking that we were entering into peanegotiations a wire haa been sent to Barclayin Moscow instructing him to inform the NKVDthat we would give them copies of all reportsobtained. C. thinks that it is probably toolate to get into touch with JAHNKE but he isgoing to see if anything can be done. Hewould not I think pe averse to our seeingMARCUS if we thought that any useful purposewould be served. We should have to do So howevin the presence of Vaudreuil. MARCUS isCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19673technically a French P/W. It appears thatMARCUS also has details of the progress ofthe atomic bomb with the names of certainprofessors. C. says it i's not a big bomb.His view is that - MARCUS is quite possibly aplant by the SD to scare us and if possibleto draw us into some arrangement which willreveal to the Germans the date and place ofour next attack.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958.OV noC.told me that he had the gravest doubtsabout-the-Seydlitz Committee He referred to-an ISOS message from Istanbul to Sofia sometime in Augustlast in which ia mentionimade of the NKVD recruiting 8 divisions or290,000-men from German P/WS..Courno Sman-in Stockholm, tosthe Polish 2eme Bureaulere, and some confirmation had also beenobtained from-Switzerland.

He is an extremely phoneyindividual with an equally phorey story thathe formerly worked in a resistance movementin Holland and then decided to go to Germanyin order to find out about V.land V.2. Hevolunteered as a worker and according to hisown account eventually got the employment ment onthese weapons that he desired. This in spiteof the fact that he started life as a fruitmerchant. He eventually seems to have endedas a Sturmbandfuhrer in the S S. He succeededin this capacit in getting back to Holland andeventually crossed the lines. It appears thathis information apout V.2 is at any rate tosome extent accurate. He is also sa ing thatwe are bomping the wrong targets and that hecan put us on to the right ones. The caselooks extremely phoney to me. I think theman is eithe r a spy or he is a Collaboratorwho has in fact been worning for the Germansin some capacity or other and now wants toput himself right with us.I spoke to Adam today apout issuing instructionto SCOs to send up to the LRC all seamenCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196arriving from the Low Country for the firsttime. This isa precaution in the light ofthe ISOS information which indicates thatone of the German commandos in Holland maybe sending an agent or agents to this country.Adam says that he will also see what he can doabout reporting arrivals Of passengers and crewas heretofore. He had heard that the abandon-ment O1 this policy had cause comment atour Wednesda meeting.I have read Stamp's note on the activitiesof Abwehr 3F, The Hague, against S.0.E. Itis purely Iactual, and worded in moderate termsbut is an appalling indictment of S.0.E.methods and negligence.The story began in June 1942 when a certainJOHANNES and a W/T operator were dropped inHolland. J. had been sent to contact the O.D.an indigenous loyalist organisation. Hewas to tell its leaders that he had come on ajoint DutCh-British mission and was to dis-Close to them the plan for Holland which hadbeen worked out. He was to obtain theircomments on this plan and to emphasise thatthe Dutch Govt. in London had approved it inppinciple and expected it to be accepted insubstance. After introducing himself to theleaders of the O.D., J. was to mane con-tact with its various sub-groups operatingthroughout the country. He would report backto London who would send out a trainedorganiser and instructors to the groups as andwhen J. reported they were ready to receivethem. For the purpose of carrying out thismission J. had to organise reception commit-tees weapons and supplies and for the addi-tional personnel which were to be sent. Theindications are that J. never operate exceptunder the control of the Germans or that he wasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19677certainly under control in November if notin August of that year. SOE were informed ona set which was obviously under control thatJ. had been arrested on the 8th Nov.1942.It is astonishing that this arrest did notindicate to SOE that it was quite hopeless tocontinue the undertaking il the chief organ-iser with all the plans was under German con-trol. To act upon the assumption that acaptured agent hasnot peen broken is to courtnot only mortal perid for those concerned butdisaster tothe whole enterprise.After the 8th Nov.1942 the part assigned toJ.by the Abwehr was carried out in the nameof KALE, his successer who had been sent outfrom this country as his No.2. Upwards of 25receptions were arranged over KIS W/T setand no less than 10 W/T operators were despat-ched from this country. AS SOE had failedto get back J.owing to his arresty K. wasasked to send to Bngland some other personthoroughly well informed about the progressof the secret organisation. In face OI thisrequirement the Abwehr determined to go throug!all the motions of supplying such a person.On the one hand this would serve the purposeof allaying any suspicion which might be feltin London and on the other hand SOE shouldbe made to disclose the method by which agentcould be evacuated from Europe. On 14.3.43SOE were therefore informed that K.woula sendhis chief assistant who was called ANTON. TheGermans were asked for particulars about ANTONand gave his name as Nicolas de WILD of acertain addressat the Hague. DAMEN,WhO wesubsequently captured was in fact the occu-pant of the address and on nstructions fromthe Abwehr was to saj,ii anyone called, thatde WILD was away but would return in a fewdays. When SOE decided to arrange For ANTON'SCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196evacuation through Belgium and Holland, some-one was found by the Germans to fill thispart and he left Holland about L2th May 1943and travelled to Paris. The spurious ANTONwas accompanied by a certain ARNAUD who hasbeen a 3F agent since 1940 and who we alsoknow was receuited by SOE as a passeur oftheirs. In Paris ANTON ana ARNAUD made con-tact with another SOE agent MARCEL. AS soonas they had sat down in a cafe with MARCELthree German soldiers came in ana startedto examine the cards of those at the backof the cafe. ANTON got up and walked out.ARNAUD said "They have arrested ANTONI.MARCELlooked out and saw ANTON crossing the road witha man in civilian clothes. Such was theaccount given by MARCEL when he arrived in thiscountry o1 ANTON'S disappearance. A greatdeal of trouble was taken to decide whetherANTON had been arrested because he had beenfollowed or whether it was sheer bad luck as tthe result of a snap check of identity cards.A great deal of trouble was also taken toassess the dangers which would fall upon theorganisation as the result of this arrest,regard being had to the fact that ANTON,accor-ding to MARCEL, had been carrying compromisingpapers. It never ce cured to anyone that ANTONwas nothing but a German agent and that ARNAUDwas lying when he said that ANTON had beenarrested. ARNAUDIS stock inevitaoly rose 1.in the eyes of London and MARCEL was sentback to the continent to fall into the enemy'shands. The problem aatisedo SOET requestfor the sending to England of a man who waswell acquainted with the secret army had beenanswered by the Abwehr with striking success.SOE then requested the fiela to send anotherman who had full knowleage of the secret armyand the reply came back that a man in closeCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1967atouch with the O.D. would be sent. In steadof chosing a fictitious individual or someonewho might by chance ge known as a German agenthere they chose a man against whom nothingadverse could be known in London,wh was infact a bona fide aatriot. This man wasKNOPPERS. He had been approached at the end af1942 or the beginning of 1943 by the 3F agentvan VLIET. KNOPPERS had been doing resistancework and had been in contact with a certainCol.Coppert, when van LIET,representing him-self as a member of the resistance,asked himif he might use KOPPERS1 address as a letter-drop. Thereafter KNDPPERS continued to seevan VLIET regularly until he rinaliy leftHolland. Van VLIET gave himself an excellentbuild-up and got thoroughiy into the confidenceof KNOPPERS. On the 20 th June 1943 he askedKNOPPERS if he would travel to England andwould return with instructions for the resis-tance organisations. As KNOPPERS understoodit the idea was that several resistance move-ments needed coordination ana central direetiorand ficial recognition and support fromLondon. This could best be obtained by send-ing an emissary from Holland and securinghis return as a liaison officer with Londoncredentials. KNOPPERS went via Paris,w wherehe stayed some weeks and was finally broughtout by SOE channels over the Pyrenees toSpain. For the purpose of facilitating KNOPP-ERS! mission he was provided with documentspurporting to come from resistance circles.These included a note to the Dutch and Britishauthorities concerned suggesting the desir-ability of establishing an escape route overwhich important Dutch intellectuals,indusists and officials in Holland who withoutthemselves acting in a rash manner had assistein the sabotage of the German war effort,mightCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19be got out of Holland. When KNOPPERS arrivedhere there were certain discrepancies in hisstory and that which had bee put over on theGerman-controlled wireless from Holland, andwhen the investigation was still proceedinginformation which had been in the possessionof SIS for many months but which had not beendistributed by them, was brought to our notice.This showed that Van VLIET,i not a Germanagent, was at Least highly suspect. We cameto the conclusion that KNOPPERS had beenplanted by SOE on Van VLIET and that theW/T agent in Holland was under control.ARNAUD however escaped suspicion and thesuggeston that the SOE escape route FromParis onwards might have been blown was notaccepted. According to KALE who was supposedstill to be in charge OI SOE activities inHolland,one STEAK, recruited in the field, hadtaken ANTON! place as second in command,ANTON having been reported as arresteu whenattempting to reach this country. SOE weredetermined to get STEAK over here. He wasalso told to bring two other agents with him.The Germans had all these peo 2e internet andwere placed in the position of having eitherto make excuses for the failure of the SOEfield Oficers to bring out the 4 men or toannounce the arrest Of these people in circum-stances which would inevitauly suggest thatthe SOE organisation had been blown. Theydecided to create 4 substitutes for the 4SOE agents. These were taken to Paris wherethey men the 4th man. There they were handedover to ARNAUD with instructions to find outby what route they would be evacuated fromFrance. ARNAUD handed them oyer to a memberof the VIC espionage organisation and theywere accepted for what they pretended to be.The last stage of the journey was in a lorryacross the frontier. Before they reached thisCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196point two of them jumped off. A littlw laterthe 3rd jumped off and hailed a car belongingto the Felagendarmerie, showing his papers.He made this car follow the lorry ana in duecourse his partner was arrestea. The 4 Germanagents weturned to Paris, ana made their re-port to ARNAUD. Subsequently SOE were inform-ed by a member of the VIC organisation thatthe 4 agents had been arrested while attempt-ing to escape, in the Pyrenees. This wasaccepted as sufficient explanation. AS VanVLIET was under some suspicion the Germansdecided to make strenuous efforts to build himup. It SO happened that the SOE agent APPOLLOwas dropped in Belgium with BRUTUS on 8thOct.1943 with instructions to use the routetaken by KNOPPERS in reverse and go toHolland. APPOLLO reached his contact addressesin Brussels, the house of a ceetainMme.MERTINS, and was there visited by VanVLIET.The latter successfully played the part ofa patriot and assisted his return to thiscountry. APPOLLO gave a tolerably good accountof VanVLIET on his arrival back here. Thenight ad ter APPOLLO was dropped a Lt.HIRST, aUSA airman, made a forced Landing in Holland.HIRST by devious means was put on to VanVLIETwho facilitated his escape. This story wasalso regarded as a re-assuring incident inproof of Van VLIET' bona fides. In August1943 2 of the captured SOE agents CHIVE anaSPROUT escaped. They reached this countryin Feb.1944 and at some stage the Germansbecame aware of this. They almost immediatelyclosed the traffic by a message on all linesaddressed to the two SOE officers by what infact were their correet names,y thanking them Icfor their long mutual cooperation and promis-ing them that if they came to the continentthey would be received with the same care astheir agents. Had the whole O1 the W/T trafficbeen under enstant review in the light Oi allCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196the known dfacts; had trick questions been putto the agents; had each mishap seen examinedwith a view to appreciating its possibleimplications on the posit ion of themeelvesand the organisation as a whole; had eachreturning agent veen meticulously questionednot because he was suspect but with a viewto obtaining all possible information Fromhim; above all had a record peen keptwhich set out in chronological orderral.the known facts reg arding the enterpriseand the sources from which such facts wereknow, a record which would have beenreadily available for consultation lin con-sidering all the above matters; had all thisbeen done there is very little doubt thatthe S9E organisation in Holland would nothavemet the fate that overcame it.Bird came to see me about his position vis-a-vis the War Room. He is rather worried ashe finds it di ficult to express a view as tohow his section can be run until he knowsmore about more about the facts and proposals.I told him as much as I knew and said I wouldhave a word with TAR.28th JanuaryA further message has come in which indicabthat the arrival of ARTHUR may be imminent.I got on to Walker and arrange that he shouldgive an extra waring to Fighter Command.Colin Roberts of SIS has senit a messageto the field to look out for line-crosserswho may be attempting to get,to Antwerp andsign on as a seaman.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1968329th January 1I saw Nigel Watson this morning. He is justback from Yugoslavia. He was apparentlysituated not far from Gorizia which of courseI know well. He constituted a liaison missionwith one of Tito's corps headquarters. Hisactivities have become very restricted. Hecould only pass on such information as wasvouchsafed to him by the Partisans. He doesnot think that we are parti ularly popular.The Partisans are very pleased to get ourarms but do not give out much in the way ofinformation. There was a Russian Oificerattached to the Mission who was apparentlyquite friendly SIS are now making a proposalto send him to N.Italy. He would be quiteprepared to gome back here if there was a jobfor him to do. He was apparentiy a littledisgruntled about the way that he haa beenpassed over in this office. He said that hetried twice to get away on an active job buton each oceasion was made to stay with blex.Finally whe Exex went,Baskerville-Glegg tookAlex's job and he was of fered an Asst.DSOpost in the Bahamas. Feeling that this wasnot good enough,he volunteered for parachutes,not because it was the job he particularlyliked but because it was the only onewhichwould get him released.Bennett came to ask me about the atomic bomb.He is responsible for Tube Alloys who areconcerned with experimental work. The DGasked him the other day what the Germans weredoing in this line. He wanted to know whetherI would keep him informed. I said that theatomic bomb was not really our business.Occasionally I heard about it from ,veryconfidentially but that I was not really atliberty to pass this on. Bennett is apparentlyCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196cthinking of asking Walsh of the Naval Sectionof SIS for the required information as hethinks that it places him in rather an awkwardposition if he cannot answer the DGS question.I said that I thought probably the DG hadmerely asked out of curiosity and that heprobablyedid not wish any special stepstaken to discover the answer. I recommendedBennett to lay off this enq iry since if C.thought he was asking about the atomic bombhe would probably have a fit. C. is underthe impression that only he and two othersin his dept. have ever heard oi it.There has been a lot of trouble owing toSwinton trying to get hold of Mark Johnston,whom he met casualiy in the Dorchester theother night. He is taking the line that inview of all he has done for this dept. it isextremely wrong that we should not hand overJohnston at once. In his characteristic wayhe has handled the matter just about as paalyas anybody could. There is no reason to thinkthat Johnston has any specia qualificationsfor the job which Swinton is oirering him andwe here have need of his services both inconnection with the work he is doing now andwhat he might do in the future in the WarRoom30 th JanuaryWalker showed me the memo on what he thinksshoula be aone in connection with the controlo1 pigeons in the rear of the armies. Thiscouument is based on our experiences here.It wiil be sent to Dick in Paris and possiblyWalker may go over to talk to the Allied Govtsconcerned.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19683James Robertson came to ask me about hischances of staying in the organisation. Itold him that it was quite impossible at thismoment for the DG to make any definitepromises because he did not yet know whatour charter was to be. II we went pack toour pre-war status we might even find itdifficult to produce sufficient for thepermanent staff to do. It was not thereforepossible to take on extra personnel with anyguarantee of permanency. I was quite surehowever that Kellar would be very glad tokeep him on for the time being as the workin Palestine was going to impose a consiaer-able burden on us.Martin Forrest has just arrived back. He needsa bit more leave,having had a break-down inCairo and would then like some more or lesslight duty at a desk,after which he would beprepared to do nything provided he could goback to his normal peace-time profession atsome not too far distant date.He said that C.E. was rather winding up inthe Mid East in spite of the fact that therewere still two German agents at lage in Pal-estine and two in Iraq.I had a long talk with Stopford about hissection. Elton will be Leaving him ana inspite of this be will only just have enoughto do. He coull very easily take on otherwork. He does not seem partidulariy anxiousto leave at this moment. At any rate he didnot suggest anything of the kind. He has agreat admiration of Hooper's work. Hooper isrunning the Swedish agents very successfully.It occurred to me that possibly Hooper might doCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1960(osome recruiting in Embassy circles. He isextremely able in that kind o1 work. I saidthat I would have a talk with Anthony andsee where our Embassy show needed streng then-ing.At the daily meeting Herbert disclosed thata more recent ISOS message indicated thatARTHUR would not be coming for another 8/10days. Apparently a moon period is notfavourable. It rather looks as if he wouldbe crossing the lines.Mark Johnston has finally broken OIf negotia-tions with Swinton. It was decided thatMark should go for a perioa't6 weeks. Swintonthen rang him up and said he wantea him tocome over at once. When Mark said that hecould not come over till the fternoon as hehad to hand over to hisasuccessfor, Swintonlost his temper, and said that he would getone of his secretaries to do the job,andbangea down the receiver.Roger came to see me. He tola me that he hadmore or less won his battle with HorroCksover the carding of communists, though inrather peculiar circumstances. He had triedto discuss the question with HorroCks beforethe DGS arrival but Horrocis had not beenvery forthcoming, beyond saying that hethought that there was a good deal of workbeing done which was of no particular value.In the interval before the DGS arrival hehad clearly been looking up a number ofcases where he had been asked to card. Thesewere all shown to the DG before his meetingwith Roger. The DG was rather inclined toaccept HorroCrts view that much of thecarding of lesser lights in the communistmovement should pe done by the local police.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19687Roger pointed out that this was not really aver practical suggestion since. the bulk ofthe information on communist came from ourown sources, Fintercepted letters,telephonechecks, agents etc. We should have to passthis informatior on to the AC.C.s for whichpurpose it would ha\ tobe carded in any caseHorrocks seemed to feel that this was anbbvious knock-out and immediately changedhis tune and said that he thought that: allthat was really required was for F.2 tolower their 100% standards slightly.

Summary for the week ending 26thJan.gives details of the new contraption fordropping agents by parachute. It consistsof a bomb-shaped canister 22 metres by L metrein which 3 agents and equipment can bedropped together. Four parachutes supportthe canister which has shock-absorbers andis sel-destroying.There are indications that German agents mayrepresent themselves as allied airmen whohave been shot down. A captured agent saidthat the type of information being received bby the Germans indicates that they may havesome control of telephonic communicationsacross our lines. Interrogations indicatethat line-rossers may make increasing useof pigeons. One has been caught with amessage for a saboteur. Four members of theHitler Jugend have been arrested, two whilegetting across the Roer. Preparatiols forguerilla warfare are said to be proceedingapart from Wehrmacht activities. The mentrained are all volunteers, party membersand mostly S.S. Training takes place in theBerlin area Wannsee and in Bavaria at Bad ToleJanuary 31stBriscow came to see me about the difficultieshe was having in getting information out ofB.1B. He mentioned the case of der SMIDT.The final 020 report had come out at the endCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196of October but he had only just heard aboutthe man's secret ink.Blunt came to see me about the case of CHOW.It is proposed that we should suggest thatthe only feasible approach is to quote thecaptured document as a reason for havingexamined Chinexe messages and discoveredthat they were insecure.Roland Bird talked to me about the WarRoom. He is not very happy about beingseparated from Buster and is still moreworried aout the possibility of gettingpapers. He thinks that files are to be fedboth to the War Room and to this Office and ththat there will be consequently very seriousholdups on both sides. A check-up shows thatout of 400 files which are out at the moment,one third are being dealt with by Busterand Bird and the rest by the remainder ofthe office. If you have the two organisa-tions in the same budiling or in adjacentbuildings, it is always possible to get onwith one's work by having a look at the filesor borrowing them for 10 minutes. If theoffices however are widely separated thetendency in each case will be to hang on tothe file and no administrative arrangementswill get over the human element. TARjoined our discussion and feels somewhatworried about the position.I lunched with Sclater and Brig.Wheatley,D.D.Sigs.W.0. and Brig.Vernham,D.D.Y. W.0.Waeatley had remarked a short time ago toVernham that he thought information leakedfrom this country through spies. I felt surethat it would be a good thing to explain tohim that this was most unlikely and thatwhat was far more probable was that informatio:was going out over the airy. Wheatley wasCatalogue Reference:KVI4/196I think easily convinced that we had anextremely strong case since he himself hadbeen for some time trying to tighten upsignals security in Italy. To do this he hadarranged for the monitoring of the signalsof a whole corps. He had caused all O.R.Swho had committed blunders to receive reduc-tion in rank and pay and had submitte theindiscretions of officers with a request toknow what disciplinary action was being taken.In one case a Brigadier lost his jop.Wheatley said that the indiscretions werebeyond belief, and there had peen cases wherewhole attacks had been given away severaldays before. He Xpressed very greatinterest in the examples of lack of securitythat Sclater had tained and is all infavour of having a drive on the lines thatwe suggest. We are putting up a paper tothe JIC and I shall talk to the DMI ara toC. before the matter comes up.Milmo came to see me about the War Room. Hefeels that the War Room should be divided upinto sections dealing with subjects andthat the case olIicers and reseaach workersshould work together on that basis. He isvery emphatic that all the machinery shouldbe a going concern before any moves take placesince it is his firm belief that if you makeany move before that has been accomplishedthe registry,which is already complaining,will break down. He is very worried aboutthe location o1 the War Room. He is quiteconvinced that if it is not in the samebuilding as ourselves or aajacent there willbe endless hold-ups both in our work ana thework of the War Room.I spent an hour and a half with Charles talk-ing about the pay of the female staff. HeCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196avshowed me the file. He told me that he,Horr-ocks and the DG had had a meeting and thatHorrocks and the DG had expressed theirviews on the file which he gave me to read.Horrock's minute refers frequently to theCommittee thinking this or that about members.of the female staff and the workthe are doingThe fact is that nobody represents thedivision on the Committee and that thereforethe Committee cannot possibly know whatvalue attaches to the work of anyone inB.Division. The only person who cangive a proper ap reciation o1 Mrs Spring'work is Herbert Hart or myself. I expressedthis view very strongly to Charles. He dianot say much but I rather felt that he wasnot altogether in agreement. I told himthat there was a feeling in the office, ofwhich he was apparently aware, that Horrockswas in the habit of doing his own peoplepretty well. I cited to him the AAs incharge of registry sections, whose workcertainly could be of no greater importancethan the creative work done by Miss Wadesonat the LRC. After reading the minutes onthe file I told Charles that I frankly couldnot feel that their answer was a good one. Itwould be possible to say to Mrs.Spring thatfor better orworse the grading system hadbeen instituted, the establishment laid dorand could not be altered exceptby Treasuryruling. If therefore the AA grade was fullupap it was impossible for anyboday to bepromoted unless as in the army you gaveacting unpaid rank. That at least would bean answer with some element of logic in it.It would however completely fell to the groundif it could be said that the establishmentwas not in fact rigid but elastic and thatlthough we had started with So many G.lsor AAs the numbers had in fact been increased.It could further be argued that where womenCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1963doing work of equal importance andresponsibility they should et-equal pay.The Treasury could I should have thought betold that they were extremely lucky to getthe services of women in many jobs whichwere formerly done by men and that they leastthey could do if the did not wish to paythem on an equality basis would be to promotethem to the highest women's grade. Howeverarguments such as these cut no ice with theTreasury, who are extremely difficult andcheese-paring. Only the other day they crackedown on us becaise a girl was. foolish enoughto say in her income tax return that shewas getting a language allowance.

He had beendining with Prince Bernhard who had told himthat-itwo sortsof rumours were circulating inDutch circles in London,on to the effectthat Bernhard himself led a very dissolutelife; this rumour had been going on for yearsand he was quite prepared, to Iaugh it OII.The other however was more serious, andsuggested that information passed to LINDEMANN@ King Kong by Bernhard had led to theafailureof Arnhem. This he said was manifestlyuntrue since he only met LINDEMANNS for thefirst time 6 days after Arnhem. I told J.ohnsthat I was aware that in Dutch circles therewas a belief that LINDEMANNS had betrayedArnhem. We had told the Dutch Securitybut as a result of our enquiries there wasno never ssible heard any foundation suggestion for this that Bernhard beef. I was hasinvolved.

The DG hadwritten a long letter to the DMI about thepart we had played on the Secona Front. TheDMI had replied cordially acknowledging ourcontribution and saying how valuable ourassistance had been in building up the militarsecurity organisation at the War Office whichwas non-existant at the outbreak o1 war.He madeit clear however that itwas his inten-tion that that organisation should in futurestand on its own feet while still using thisdept. for purposes of advice. He made noreference however to civil security and tothe major problems of C.I.,catching spies etcLennox has just told me that the last planeout for the Yalta conference carrying 12passengers including Peter Loxley has come dowin the Med. of Lampedusa. 9 bodies have beerpicked up, 5 are said to be missing and 7injured. This is quite the worst bit O1 newsI have heard. I saw Peter the night beforehe left at the Club. He told me he had justbeen to Oxford to see the doctor who islooking after his wife. She had just had astill-born child. He said tha he could quiteeasily have avoided going to the conference buCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196that the doctor had told him that his wilewould probably be mare worried if he hadstayed than il he went.

We decidedthat the best line oi action woula be throughthe use of an intercept letter to try andcheck CHOW from calling Lor reports from theChinese naval cadets. We would then refer tothe document captured in the Far East whichindicated that Chinese telegrams Irom Londonwere being inte cepted, state that our crypt-ographers haa veriliea that the Chinese cypher!were extremely easy to break ana suggestas a way out of the difficulty that we shouldre-encypher them. This might have the effectof enabling us to continue to read the Chinesecyphers while securing them from the vaps.It would also enable us to control the volumesince we could say that we could notencypher more than a certain number. Itwould also ensure against the buying up ofcyphers in Chungking by the Japs whichaccording to reports from Chinese sourcesin the Far East is almost common form.

He is getting on tosome extent with the War Room. Having seexC. it has been agreed that T-R shall run thresearch side of things. TAR had been doubtfabout employing him as there had been SO muchop; osition from Section V.Oflicers.

He said that he had alwaysbacred T-R and that it would be a great mis-take to leave him out of the organisation.Herbert has complete his analysis of theStockholm K.reports which we have picked upon Jap JMAS: The information relates verylargely to the strength and dispositions ofBritish and American air force units. In somecases the in ormation appears to be quiteimportant and a large amount of it is accurate.The fact that most of the informationrelates to air matters and both Britishand American air matters, are a pointer towathe CERVELL-TUrNer combination although thereis no positive proof. Meanwhile a study ofreports by Kraemer the I.Luit man in Stock-holm seemed to show that the informationreaches the Japs through one of Kraemerisagents in Swedish ovt.circles. There is apossibility that some of the misinformationmay be invented by Kraemer or by the Japs.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19699February 6thSince yesterday there have been no reportson ISOS or ISK from Berlin. On the other handthere has been no operator's chatto showthat the Berlin station is closing down. Inthe circumstance it would not be surprisingif it was.C. rang me up today about certain OI Kraemertreports which have been got by an SIS agentin Stockholm. One which was obtained on the26 th Jan. related to a change in their plans.It was said that the offensive which was totake place early in March had now been put onto early or mid Feb. owing to the Russianoffensive. It stateu that the attach was tocome on the British sector and gave the units.Chough the information is not strictly accurateit contains a certain amount of truth and isgenerally regardea as dangerous. The reportin possession of Kraemer was teleprintea on toBerhin on the 31st. C. had wantea to let meKNOW that it had appeared on MSS on the 28th.He thought it might have been telephoned fromStockholm and then confirmea by teleprinter,or that the agent might have got hisdateswrong. What of course would be o1 interestto us would be to see precisely the text ofthe MSS and to learn how far it coincideswith the text of the letter transmitte by theagent from Stockholm. If there is identitythen think we must at least envisage thepossibility of a leakage from this country,in which case we shoul regard CERVELL andTurner as good starters. Itymight moreoverbe argued that since in any attach the airforce in this country would obviously be takinpart yarreessice would be better informedthan army circles.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/196torAnthony and I attended the JIC today whenhis paper about the Chinese was discusseeg.The plan was generally agreed but DNI thoughtperhaps it might be better to launch it inChungking rather than here. Wedemeyer theAmerican new broom who is a kind of Chief ofStaff to Chiang Kai Shek,was thought to bethe best channel. This would ensure Americanco-operation and clear the American interest irJap BJs. which may be in jeopardy. I agreerto this course of action but did issue awarning that it would be extremely importantto see that the Chinese got the story right.Otherwise they might say something in telephone-ing their instructions to their variousstations abroad which would invariably leadthe Japs to think their telegrams were veingdecyphered.Bevan and John Senter came to see me about thecase of one James PONSONBY who had formerlyworred for SOE in Tangier where he had done anextremely good job in which Dudley Clark anaBevan had been interested. He haa in factposed as a disgruntled British official inTangier and had sold the Germans a bogus docu-ment which was to mislead them at the time ofour attack at Salerno. It was proved fromISOS that the plan was completely successiuPONSONBY had since been given a job inLisbon, the exact nature of which I do notknow. Through his own indiscretions and ratherodd behaviour it had been decided that he wasnot the man to carry out the task, particularlysince he no longer had the confidence of hissubordinates. PONSONBY had taken this veryhardly and had made all sorts of threats(a) regarding disclosures and (o) demanding asum of E110,000 in compensation.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/196/DIThe general impression is that he is the typethat goes off into a tantrum and subsequentlyregrets what he has said and done. He wasordered to go home and threatened to commitsuicide say ing that he thought he wouldprobably be shot when he got to London. Heis obviously in a very unbalanced state.He has now agreed to come. The object ofSenter's and Bevan's visit was to prepare merfor the possibility that there might be somenecessity to lock him up if he really becametroublesome. I urged on them the view that ifthis could possibly be avoided, it would be agood thing, since once you lock a man upthere always comes a time when you have to lethim out. Assoon as 18B was abolished, and itwould be at Stage A, there would be no powersunder which he could be held. It seemedtherefore desirable ii possible to find himsome kind of employment that will give him theoutlet he requires. On the other hand if histhreats do really appear to be serious andhe contemplates giving away his past activitieboth SOE and the Controller felt very stronglythat he will have to be locked up,if onlytemporarily. It is very much hope that thislimit will not be reached.I saw Seymer and Hoiiis about a case of anagent of M'S who is connected with GermanCommunist circles here. These circles areanxious to penetrate the internment camps.They presumably feel that in they can recruitsome good let wing agents they will beable to operate as soon as they get back toGermany. We all thought that the projectshould be encouraged in ordery that we couldsee how it developed.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/196TAR came in to talk about the War Room. He Wwants to get Duster and his whole outfittransplanted in due course. He also feelsthat Roland is perhaps unsuitable to run thesection in the War Room as he is rather atloggerheads with HorrockS. He does not thinkhowever that the necessary accommodation islikely to be found for some time,and thattherefore most of the work will have to go onin its own environment at any rate forsome weeks. I said that I would preferthat Buster and his minions remained herebut if it was foundabsolutely impossible toarrange things otherwise I would see whatcould be done. There was no harm in themeantime in building up Buster's section herewith personnel from the War Room. Buster camein later to discuss the same subjeet. Hestill thinks that the section should be insome building which is connected with our-serves and that any other arrangement will bewery inconvenient.Marriott and Astor came in to tell me thatthe French,with whom we have been lookinginto the case of GILBERT, have now comeforward with an accusation against Bodding tonof SOE who they think was working for theGermans. We have said that they shouldstate their full reasons in writing when wewill of course conduct the most carefulenquiry. It may oreover be necessary nowfor numerous other witnesses to come Overfrom France. The accusation will presumablybe based on statements of people heid inFrance and if we are to pringya charge againstBodding ton we ought to have their first handevidence.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19603Dick Butler talked to me about the plan foramalgamation. Somebody, I think Charles orHarker, has suggested to the DG that a goodof unrest is being caused in the office owingto our discussions with Arnold-Forster. DGhas rather cracked aown on noall our discussionsand is apparently fundamentally opposed tototal amalgamation. We shali I think haveto inform A-F about this as soon as he comesback from America. I shall also have to tellhim that from a conversation that I have hadwith C. I have the impression that he isreg arding himself as the future chief o1 anycombined organisation, if such an organisa-tion is to come into being. He did nothowever appear to be very sanguine about themerits of the fusion. He is still scaredabout getting into the limelight. As I see ititis is more and more difficult for us toagree to total amalgamation unless we getsome guarantee that a purge will take placein SIS and that the head will not be selectedfrom personnel of eith MI5 or MI6.February 7thCypher instructions have now reached Millsin Canada. He is therefore in a position todecypher the message received froom Madridby MOONBEAM. Wireless contact between Maariaand Canada continues to be maintained andMadrid is supplying GARBO in London withcopies of the messages passed.Bronx has received from the Germans a further2 months salary amounting to E197.

Summary For the week ending Feb 2ndshows that the Abwehr are at the moment concentrating on meeting the tactical intelli-gence requirements O1 the armies whereas theSD are concentrating on long term and stay-behind arganisations by the use o1 potentialpersonnel from liberated countries. TheG.I.S. continues to add to a large-scaleespionage, sabotage ana propaganda network.Incoming agents are being nstrueted toprepare to receive future ones and capturedGerman agents and German sympathisers. Itis thought that the Germans are urgentlycreating a stay-behind network on the leftbank O1 the Rhine. Meanwhile considerableline-crossing activities are going on by theAbwehr in the direetion of Leiter I west. TheHitler Jugend have been used as line-crossersand more are expeeted. The parachute operationhave not been taking place lately owing tobad weather but there is evidence that fairlylarge numbers of people are to be dropped infuure.I had a long discussion with Curry on theopening chaper of his book. It ranged mainlyround the question of executive functions.I was maintaining that in practice we do nothave any executive functions since evers thingwe do is on the authority of somewne else.The argument is I think rather academicand of no special importance.meC. rang up to tell/that a telegram had come inshowing that steps had already been takenin Delhi to tighten up Chinese cyphers. Hethought Anthony should see this before puttingup his letter to the JIC.

Thereis no doubtfrom the text that the MSS refersto the:'same information passed on by Kraemerin Stockholm. It even mentions that it wasobtained from an agent.

NOV oldMilmo and Wilson came to talk about theSCHLESINGENSEIF case. They have not gotStepehens' report/which the man says that hedoes not wish to be treated as a deserter butas a former SD official who has run agentsthad not been ba agent himself. We all feltthat this statement might have been made mnuera certain amount of pressure and without afull knowledge of its implications. We alsorealise that if the man was treated as avivilian the French could if they desired layclaim to his body. He could only remain hereas a P/W who had been passed pack by theAmericans. We decided therefore to hand himover to M.I.19.Catalogue Reference:V/4/19607I had another session with Curry about thefirst chapter of his book.I lunched with Joe Lynch. He told me thataccording to the nstars and Stripesi, EagarHoover has been offered the job of Commissioneof Baseball and that it is being kept openfor him till after the war. Joe said hehad heard some rumour about this when he wasin the States and that he had tac led the bosswho had said that he could not possibly leavethe Bureau during war time and rather impliedthat he did not contemplate taking the job.He did not however close the door entirely.The job is worth $75,000 a year.I talked to Jim Hale about the case of JamesPONSONBY. He got into touch with John Senterwho is already in dilticulties. PONSONBY onarrival here today said that he haa leftcertain papers in Lispon and that on a workfrom him they would be handed over to theGermans and would blow the whole of SOESscheme on which PONSONBY was engaged. Theman is obviously mad.I had a talk with JC about the Boddingtocase. I wanted him to take it over but he isevidently reluctant to do so. He advancesthe view that we shoula not be mixed up withitmore than is necessary since it is a matterbetween the French ana SOE. I explainea to himthat we could not altogether take that linesince it had always been our policy to assisSOE in any enquiries particularly in the caseof a British agent who was thought to havegone wrong. It was left that we would seewhat the outcoe of our meeting with the Frenclwould be.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1960Vaudreuil,Kressman, Hugh Astor,Herbert,Marriotand I took part in the discussion on Bodding-ton, this afternoon. I said that our onlycourse in this rater would be to presastthe indictment to the Security Division ofSOE and to co-operate with them in anyenquiries that were necessary. Much of the worlhowever would have to be done by them and weshould be entirely dependent on them as towho was brought into the case. We could notfor example prevent them from consultingBuckmaster. Had the French any objection?Or would they like to be informed before any-thing was done? They placed themselvesunreservedly in our hands and said that theyperfectly understood that SOE would have tobe the judges. We undertook to let them knowas soon as possible whether we wanted any ofthe bodies in the case brought over to thiscountry. We thought SOE should have theopportunity of expressing their views ont is point. It was agreea tha there was atthe moment no evidence against Boading ton andthat the theory that Jeannette was the culpritfitted all the facts. The French Delt howeverthat Boddington was SO linked with Jennettethat if she were wrong he must have knownnething about it if indeed he was not aparty to her activities. There is no doubtthat some very curious facts have emergedaand that Bodding ton has quite a lot toexplain. I undertook to see SOE tomorrow andlet the French know the result. It wasagreed that in So 1ar as Brutus was concernedwe could renounceeany interest in the bodiesat present under arrest. All we asedwasthat their cases should not be tried publiclyin the near future. An assurance on thispoint was given.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/196February lOthJohn Senter came over. I showed him the memowhich Kressmann had prepared in which itissuggested that Boddingtor may be the culpritin the GILBERT case. He Said that he wouldlike to have an opportunity of examining thedocument and consulting other members oi hisoffice. Meanwhile he thought that the sugges-tion might have been prejudiced and that onche whole they seemed to him most improbable.1 xplained to him that the matter was some-what urgent since the French wanted to knowas early as possible whether the presence ofBARDET (Roger) was required in this country.There is no doubt I think that the French Xrather have it in for Bucimaster,. partly Ibelieve because certain SOE people have madea proaches to their former agents and askedthem to continue working for them in France.This has got to the ears of the French, whonaturally resent it. Buckmaster has beenmaking a tour of his various circuits with aview to giving rewards, and the French havebeen placing considerable dit itliculties inhis way. They probably regard his visit as atour for the purpose of giving instructionsto his people on the work that they are toconduct in France in future. In this ofcrse the French are entirely mistaken,t. Jugh their attitude is understandable.There is no doubt that in some ways theywould be rather glad to prove not only thatBuckmaster's circuits were blow but that hishead man, a British subject, wa S atraitor.Boddington is apparently a rather curiouscharacter, who has lived most of his life inFrance, and the possibility of his havingacted as an agent cannot be entirely ruledout although SO far there does notappear tobe any concrete evidence.Catalogue Reference:kV/4/19I talked to Roland Bird. TAR had at one stagesuggested that he should control the caseofficers in the War Room. Buster For onereason or another did not agree wit h thissuggestion not least because he evidentlywants to do the job himself. He put forwardvarious reasons why Bird would not be suitablethe principle one being that he did not geton very well with Horrocis. Roland did notwish to go into the War Room but was some-what flattered by the offer and did not sethat he had any valid excuse Ior turningdown. He would therefore have accepted itsomewhat against his own inclinations. Heis on the whole quite relieved to remain hereand deal with the specia cases formerlyhandled by Herbert.THISIs A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDI had another session with Curry ON the ERISEESIONchapter of his war book.E,PUBLICRECORDSACTAnthony has picked up onthe details of a memo which CERVELL has dic-tated to Nordenskiold. In this he refers toa conversation that he has had with Maycock.Maycock has told him th t he has recentlyvisited the secret service and had discussionswith then about Karl FLORMAN and his sonwho are suspect, and that the British andAmericans are tr ing to eleiminate them.On enquiry we find that Maycock did at thsuggestior of Hepbertson and Malet,ouMinister in Stockhoom, have a conversationwithin order that Maycock and theMinister might know the general background ofthe FLORMAN case. The later yhad beenrefused a visa to go to this country andconsiderable pressure was being brought tobear on the Minister to get the decisionreversed. There is no doubt that Maycock':Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19disclosures are highly embarrassing both toourselves and to SIS and that his actionreally constitutes a court-martial offence.In view of the source of the information,however, we shall have to proceed withconsiderable caution. I have sent a copyof the information to C. and sugested thatwe should mae a joint approach to Inglis.Maycock we think should be removed fromhis post and sent to some distant land. Itwould be disastrous to have him wanderingaut here. This is the second time he hasbrotted his copybook. On the previous occasionhe wrote a letter to CERVELL which he sentby the bag for Air Ministry approval, anddelivery, in which he warned CERVELL that theSecurity people were interested in him. Theonly inference to be drawn on that occasiongas that Maycock was of the lowest order ofintelligence On the other hand as a dealerin Rolls Royce engines he doubtless wishesto Keep in well with the Swedes..THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION(4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958.NOV0000dthen talked to me apout Hiii, the SOE manin Moscow, who is Aapparentiy very well inwith the Ambassador and very much in thelatterts confidence. There are rather unplea-sant rumours about the reasons for this asso-ciation. It is thought that Hill may berendering certain services which if know tothe Soviet authorities would place theAmbassador in an extremely embarrassingposition. This may be all idle gossip, butthere is no doubt that Hill sees a great manyCatalogue Reference:kV/4/196papers in Moscow. There has recently beena suggestion that Hill should take over theSIS liaison as well as the SOEI C. has deiinit-ly turned this dow. It would be by nomeans surprising if Hill was giving more thanhe got. He certainly gets Very little. TheSoviet people brought back his mistressfrom Siberia and she is now living with himfor obvious reasons.I spoke to C. about Hart's memo on theJMA. He said he would very much like tosee the memo. He thought that possibly thebest course would be to put the matter up tothe JIC coupled.a: with the infoomation aboutthe leakage of operational information throughKraemer. I told C. that we thought that theleakage in this country was probably throughthe CERVELL-TURNER compination. He suggestedthat we might try and put through a piece ofhot information and see how it came out inStockholm. This seems a good idea.Gen.West has seen the DG on the subject ofMaunsell. West said that unless the DGthought Maunsell was not suitaole Ior theappointment, the present proposal was thathe should join the Control Commission and beresponsible for all Future C.I. planning.The DG said that he had heard variousrumours about Maunseil but that in hisview, if he was under proper control he wascapable of running the organisation. Westintimated to the DG that if Maunsell came inRonnie might wish to go. The DG has sinceasked me to use my influence vith Ronnie toget him to stay. I haye already seen Ronniewho has expressed to me his anxieties aboutbeing able to work with Maunsell. I told himthat while I sympathised with his views,itwould be a very serious matter for the ControlCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTIONACT3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS1958Commission and also uesalves if he didnot stick to his post. I am inclined tothink that in the long run he will, or atany rate he will give the job a trial.February 12thI saw Charles Butler about the payment ofagents in Gib. SIS who agreed to pay theSaction V agerits who we took over,are nowging down that we mustsupply them withall sorts of details. This will obviouslybe very troublesome from the point of view ofaccounting and ot work. I have suggested toCharles and he and the DG have agreed, thatwe should pay for all the agents except thetwo P.section agents who are adminis trativelyunder our control.I spent the whole morning at Broadway at ameeting with Vivian,T livian,TAR.Buster,Pearson TAR andWynnscott of OSS anaWe discussedTARS plan for the War Room, which is to obtairits final approval this afternoon from C.andthe DG and Murphy and later From KennethStrong and Dick. TARS arrangement Seems tobe quite sound. He wants Milmo to run thecase officers,which is really the bulk of theib, since a good deal of' the research workll be done in the case sections. Theother sections deal with administration,communicatiols, Pair, documents and publica-tions. I made it clear taat while I wasquite content to let Milmo aid all hispeople work in the War Room as long as theyremained at SJ, I had to enter ya caveatthat we should not be able to give the samecontribution ir they were to be placed inanother building. I also made it clear thatour people worsing in the War doom would beCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196ikunder our administrative CO:trol and wouldalso be responsible to us for a certainpercentage of their work.I asked Teresa about the agents in Gib.andwhether those taken over from Section V.performed any ifferent Functions to theones we had recruited ourselves. She seemerto think that there was no diiference.Kellar brought in GenEraser,our MA inTeheran. We had quite an interesting dis-cussion, particularly on the attitude ofthe Russians. Fraser thinks that they arequite genuinely suspicious of our intentions.The subsidised Persian press constantlypublishes articles about our designs on Bakuafter the last war. Whetherthis is merely tocreate an atmosphere or due to a genuinebelief that we shall make some attempt onsimilar lines after the present war,it isot absolutely certain. Before long wepropose to make a suggestion that armed forcesshould be Nithadraw from Teheran. This willonly be done on a reciprocal basis. Frasertold me that Brocas-Burrows lost his jobon account of a lecture which he gave inCairo to certain officers. He was verycritical oi the attitude O1 the SovietGovt. towards his mission. This got backto the Russians who aeclared him persona nongrata. He was therefore sent to W.Africa,and given promotion.John Senter came in. He had reaa the memoabout Boddington and had com; definitelyto the onclusion that there was no real sub-stance in the allegations made.

It has been agreedthat we will pay all C.E. agents whetherthey were originally recruited by us orSection V. and that SIS will pay for theP.section agents.I have been told about two further secretdecisions at the Crimea Conference. One is thathe Dardenelles are to be internationalised.What precisel this means I don t know, unlessthe area is to be take away from the Turksand come under international control. Winstonhas apparently undertaken to break the newsto the TurKs, although Joe originally Olfereato do so. The othe point is that apparertlyAlexander is to command our troops foroccupation,instead O1 Monty.In a letter from Cyril, he ex lains how thingswent wrong over the cases of COLEPAUGH andGIMPEL, the two German agents who proceededto the States in a submarine, Having heardnothing from us Cyril had assumed that theinformation he had got from DNI ottawa wasmerely of the gossipy kind. He had leftOttawa before getting our reply,an conse-quently when in Washington mentioned theincident to Mic y Ladd. He thought possiblythe US.Navy might have been the source.The FBI had heard nothing nor did they hearanything till about 3/4 Dec. when ONI toldthem that a Canadian tanker had been sunk offthe US coast and that one or probably moreagents had been landed. From then on the FBItried to secure further information from ONIand were eventually told that the statementabout landing agents was pure supposition.Under interrogation COLEPAUGH and GIMPELstated that on or about 22nd Dec. the sub-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/196imarine received a message giving instructionsthat the landing was not to be eilectea atFrenchmen's Bay, as another submarine hadbeen sunk there. These instructions werehowever disregarded. From the above statementthe FBI assumed that the actual place oflanding,namely Frencheman's Bay, was mentionedin Ultra and that had they been told theywould have got on to the spies much sooner.Cyril has told th them however that there may hea flaw in their argument since it is quitepossible that Frenchmant Bay may have peenselected before the departure of the submarineand that in their message the German commandermay only have been told to avoid the previous-ly selected place. The only reason thatCOLEPAUGH and GIMPELWere caught is that theyhad a row and spearated. COLEPAUGH who isan American was stupiu enough to let hispresence be known to a friend of his, andwas eventually given away. He then gave adescription OI GIMPEL and said that he haasome kind of Peruvian background and readPeruvian newspapers. The FBI therefore covereevery newsstand in New York where Peruviannewspapers were sold and caught GIMPEL inone day.The C.E.summary O1 AFHQ for Dec.1944 showsthat 56 agents had been captured excludingtwo parties of saboteurs in uniform numbering13. Altogether in the campaign 82 cases havebeen tried, 29 executed and 291 sentenced toimprisonment.A document captured recertly emanating fromthe OKW in Berlin directs all Abteilungsleiterin North Italy to prepare for the eventualliquidation of Italian collaborators who havehad access to secret information about theGerman intelligence organisation sinceCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196127experience has shown that they cannot betrusted. This liquidation is to take placeat a given signal,when the Germans witharawfrom N.Italy. It is hoped to put thesedocuments to good use in the near future.There is increasing evidence of over-all SDcontrol. The SD have been engaged duringthe last two months in attempting at intervalsto penetrate allied intel ligence organisationsby sending agents across the lines withinstructions to surrender at once,say thatthey have been forced into the German serviceagainst their will and then attempt to getrecruited by an allied secret organisation.The moving spirit is Dr.RAGAN @ BEGUS of theSD at Verona who is also preparing a stay-behind network in N.Italy.February 16 thBurt came to see me about the two moreofficers required for Paris.

He said hewas only concerned about getting Hoover overand tying him up with ourselves for alltime.

The was only allegsince the informatio was inaccurate, anuwas to the effect that there was oneCanadian battalion (parachute) in Canadaand this was intended to go toAustraliain Jan.1945. DMI Ottawa had learned ofthisfrom Brisbane who had passed to him amessage from Tokyo to Manilla dated 24thNov. which ran approximately as follows:"Special report Swedish Air Attache (Swedish-Bakan) one parachute battalion now inCanada is due to go to Australia in Jan.45"This is apparently a verpatim relay byCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196t 29Tokyo to Manilla of aJMA dated 20th Nov.which adds that 4other Canadian battalionsare in the U.K. but does not give thedescription or source, pointing to CERVELL,which has been added by tokyo to Manilla,no doubt to add to its veracity.

There may alsohave been instances in which a prisonerhas talked because undue pressure was broughto bear upon him or because the tricks usedagainst him were more clever than he wasmentally capable of ithstanding or becauseof other extenuating circumstances.

He begins bysaying thatit is no exaggeration to saythat on the British Govt.': present hald-ling of the Palestine problem will mainlydepend our ability to retain the predomina-ting influence we enjoy in the Mid East,an area where our interests, political andstrategic, are being increasingly menacedby both Russian and French designs and byan acal mulating xenophobia in the ArabStates fanned by a growing belief that ourpolicy in Palestine consciously favoursthe Jew in preference to the Arab. Asthat belief grows - and the fact that we toono punitive toal in Palestine for theassassination of Lord Moyne is turningbelief into conviction - So are wecorrespondingly losing from the very corsiderable reserves of Arab goodwill whichwe have acquired for ourselves during thewar years.It is the view of theauthorities on the spotthat more troublemust be expected in further and increasingacts of terrorism inspired as it may soonbe by Arabs as well as by Jews, a d thatorganised rebellion, following any announee-ment of policy, is a possibility thatcannot be discounted.The Arabs withinPelestine are admittealy aisuritea andlacking in leaaership. separated into. noCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19637less than 6 different political parties,they show little evidence of politicalmaturity or of any present ability to sinktheir differences. The Arab line is towarn us against the encroachments of Russiainto whose arms the Arabs will be thrownif we do not satisfy their aspirations.If the British contemplate partition, theindications are that the Arabs will. notbeentirely united. Ibn Sauds belateg andteluctant agreement to join the newly-formedleague of Arab States and his recentmeeting with King Farouk are Co sidered asbeing less concerned with a desire toachieve Arab unityas with securing analliance with the Egyptian King against theHashimite house now ruling in Iraq andTrans-Jordan. The Emir Abdullah ofTrans-Jordan too is more concerned with hisown dynastic ambitions than with moreambitious schemes for Arab unity. He covetsa greater Syria with his capital inDamascus and to secure this prize Fromour hands he is prepared to see Palestinewest of the Jordan in Jewish suzerainty.Again, Nuri Said, ex-premier of Iraq,anxious that the Arab countries shouldcontinue in close and friendly relations wit.the British, has now indicated that he isprepared to do what he can to persuaae hisown colleagues that they must face the factthat the ultimate partition of Palestineis inevitable.On the Lionist side Dr. Weisman,dur hispresent visit to alestine, has warned hisfellow members of the Executive that ifterrorism continues the Zionist cause standsin grave danger of losing not only muchof the moral support it enpys outsideCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196Palestinem but more important of all, thepolitical and very practical sympathy ofMr.Churchill. So it is that the Agency isnow co-operating with the British authoritessecurity, policy and Secretariat, in anattempt to stamp out terrorism. ThisCO-operati is however conditional andlimited. The Agency will only continueas long as they believe that their ultimatedemands will be met. Meanwhile they areonly passing to the police lists of namesfor the latter to make the arrests.The police who have no adequate records feelbound to act on the Agency's information.They receive very little information fromthe AGENCY ABOUT THE ORGANISATION EITHERof the Stern Group or the -rgun. This isbecause the agency ane only woo well awarethat the police have signally failed topenetrate these two organisations and thatthe CID are now to a very la rge extentdependent on the Agency security officersfor most of the evidence upon which thetarrest of terrorists can be affected.The more the police become dependent onthe Agency the more authority the Agencyconsider they acquire and in indeed do,in the civil administrat on of Palestine.This extra-eonst ti tutional action whichthe Agency is now allowed to take inPalestine has in fact given it somethingof the status of an imperium in imperiaIt kidnaps or openly arrests terroristswith its own personnel, usually seconded forthe work from the ranks 66 the Agency's para-military and entirely illegal Haganaorganisation.

These includeLinlithgow's son and also an officer calledAlexander who they wrongly believe to be arelation of the General.I had a talk with Alley,Crauiurd and Herbertabout Craufura's rep ort on diamond smugglingThe report centres round SLIHICKI who hasbeen previously mentioned. The conclusionsare that the Polish 2eme Bureau are fairlydeeply involved. The Poles have as ed usto let them know the results of our enquirieand Craufurd has prepared a memo. He hashowever based it rather on the possibilityof the diamonds reaching the enemy thanon the im roper conduct o1 members of the2eme Bureau. Herbert thinksthat the latteris sounder ground. Craufury is going toamend his memo accordingly.I saw John Mair. He is over here withHill-Dillon. He was much impressed by thelarge number of MI5 people he had seen inCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196Paris, all of whom appeared to be in coinmand-ing positions. I asked him how far H-D wasprepared to work to the war Room. He saidthat provided C.was agreeable he thought thathe would go a fair way. The only diificultyis the communications.I talked about C.I.activities on the Ita ianfront. Mair aamitted there had been very littleplanning. N-D apparently is opposed to anyplanning and prefers what he calls impro-visation. He had got away with it all rightin N.Africa as he had cleverly exploited theFrench through Trevor-Wilson. He haa no rightto assume that he would get similar co-opera-tion from the Italians but in this respecthe had again been lucky. SIM had in factbecome integrated with intelligence stafi'sin all the higher formations. They even hadtheir representative in Lisbon, France andSwitzerland. On the whole this had workedextremely well, although there had never beenany very efficient screening. I asked apoutthe agents in Sicily. Mair said they had onlyjust arrived and he doubted whether their setshad even piped up. AS egaras the two setsrounded up in Rome, these had been heard firstby RSS and then tracie aown with sniiters.Mair is still determined to get intointo the FO if he can possibly manageit.February 20 thMilmo talked to me about the KingKong case.During the night two Press representativesof the Daily Mail found their way to Camp020 where they got a cool reception. As theywent way they took a flashlight photo oi thegates. The matter is being taken up by Press&c Censorship. We have been in touch withNiall MacDermott who did not wish anythingCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196THIS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENTRETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTIONlu33 (4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958published uhtit Ger the trial In the lightof recent developments however it was sugges.tethat we should tell the Press that towardsthe end of last year a Dutch subject suspectedof treachery was brought to this country bySHAEF, that early in December he was hanaedback to the Dutch authorities in Horiand anathat he is now awaiting trial there. The manwas not a Dutch officer and is not in theTower. Lastly there is no evidence that hebetrayed or had any advance knowledge of theArnhem operation. We shall then say that inthe circumstances it will be appreciated thatmany of the statements which have recentlyappeared in the Press have been not onlyunfounded but mischievous and apart From caus-ing pain and anxiety to the relatives O1 the nmen who - took part in the Arnhem-landingshave been well calculated to prejudice thefurther investigations of the case. The casebeing sub judice no further statement bemade at present.C. talked to me aboutHe has seenPassy and Manuel and told them that he is75% certain thatunless he is one-oftheir D.A.s, is a spy. The French have takenthe matter very seriously. They suggest thatwe should watchre.and-search himwhen he leaves. I said that we would bequite prepareu to do this provided the Fo.agreed. The French will search hison the other side.At the JIC meeting touas our signals securitypaper was discussed. It was decided that thematter should be thoroughly investigated bythe Firth Commit ttee who are to report to theJIC what machinery they thought necessaryf'or dealing with the situation. MeanwhileCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196Authe Services were urged to monitor their ownsignals and RSS was asked to give a largercontribution towards the monitoring of civiliarsignals. The Air Ministry representativepointed out that the Air Force were intention-ally committing a certain number of indiscre-tions in an attempt to get the ftwalie intothe air. Their signals therefore had to belooked at in the light of these tactics.Ede came to talk to me apout a letter whic.the Du had asked him to write to Hendersonin which Henaerson is told that he is to getinto direct touch with the FBI and try andobtain their approval for circulating thereports on negroes both to ourselves and toBSC. This on the grounds that he is actingfor both MI5 and MI6. I told Ede that nothingcould be more aisastrous. Once the FBIthought-that we were passing their reports-. toBSC they would dry up completely. This was aregrettable state of affairs but nothingthat I could see could alter it.AS regards-Ceylon and CL-planning in theFar East Ede was rather anxious to take thebull by the horns and discuss the whole matterwith SIS. I--said that in view of a telegralI had had about para.9 oi Courtenay' letterit was clear that Lamplough dia not wish usto take this matter up and he intended to. doSO on his arrival in this country.I sent a rather stufiy telegram to Cyril com-plaining that the FBI have ot let us have acomprehensive report about COLEPAUGH alidGIMPEL. A report that has reached us fromNID on the case indicates that the agents wereto use the 1942 amateur edition of the RadioHandboek.Fron this they were to use standardCatalbeceaReterencek4196r the heading of theirmessages, such type signals as might be usedtby aircrait in communicating with the fieldor by outlying stations of coastguards orlighthouses. The men also carried letter-drops in Lispon and Maarid as well as thenames of American P/W in German hands, towhom letters could be adaressea.I saw Tommy last night. He had a ratherdifferent story about the decisions at theCrimea Conference. As far as he could recallthe question Oi the Montreux agreement wasrather sheived. on the whole the view isthat we got more than we gave. The Russianswere persuaded to take reparations to someextent in kind instead of in cash. Theywere also made to agree that only two of theirfederated states should have representation atthe Peace Conference. The P.M. before theCrimea Conference telephoned to Rooseveltsaying that everything would be done toassist his passage.He concluded: "FromGibraltar to Malta,Let nobody lalter. FromMalta to Yalta, let nobody alterit.February 21stFish came in to tell me that in spite of thefact that the Yard had rung up the F.0. twiceevery day to know whether ROWELL haa arrivea,the F.O. had denied it although ROWELL hadbeen in the country Dor 5 or 6 days. I believthe F.0. have now lost him.At the Weanesday meeting Grogan made a state-ment about the weakness OI French cersorship.It is clearly impossible to place any reianceupon the Controle Technique, particularlyinso far as any testing for Secret ink isconcemed. Belgian Censorship is to be with-draw after the cessation O1 hostilities.Brock mentioned that on the 13-14th two agentsCatalogue gueReferenceskv4fgo in Athens and 14lulothers had been dropped S.E. o1 Patras. 7 haagiven themselves up.Walker stated that 790 roCkets had beendropped up to date,&K an average o1 about12 per day.Hill-Dillon and John Mair came to see me.H-D wants an officer here to represent himon the Austrian Control Commission. H-D him-self will be in charge of C.I. and in thatrespect Maunsellis opfosite numper inthe German Control Commission. He will bedoing planning in Italy but wants someone tohold a watching brief here. I am suggestingDykes.Sclater and I had lunch with Capt.rirth whois head of the W/T Security Committee andhas been charged with looking into the questioof Signals Security. He seems an excellentfellow and is very conscious of the need Iortightening things upAfter lunch I saw Passy, Manuel ana Vaudreuil.This was purely a courtesy visit. they wereextremely frienaly and said that they wouldalways welcome the presence OI MI5 in Paris.There was a general feeling that they havefar more confidence in us than in anyoneelse.I talked to the D.G. about the publication pythe Mirror about an alleged Dutch officerinthe Tower. It refers of course to the LINDE-MAN case.He seemed to be rather opposed toa prosecution but was all in Favour of a ques-tion in the House, which would damp thingsdown and indicate that the Mirror had probab-ly caused a great deal of pain to the relativeof those who fell at Arnhem by stating thatthe disaster was due to a betrayal by a spy.The allegation is of course untrue.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/196Herbert has produced a note O.C. Havingread Alec Kellar's memo on the Mia East he hascome down heavily on my side that O.C. cannotinterfere in policy and must be confined topurely administrative matters. He recommendsthat it should be divided into 5 blocks, MidEast, Far East and Australasa, Meaiterannean(Malta &c Gib), Africa, East West and south,Caribpean, Canada and possibly United States.He thinks there ought to be a correspondingsection in B.Division to ohtrol these areasin the same way as Kellar controls Mid East.Dev has agreed to the establishment of Raaarat Malin Head. The apparatus us used toenable our Air Force to locate their positionwhen dealing with U-boats. The station willbe run notionally by the Irish ostensibly Forthe guidance o1 aircraft. The RAF are to bein control until peace time when the Irishtrainees will take overr.Cecil and I dined with Wickham. He has beenoffered the job of reorganising the policein Greece. He had a veryatislactory inter-view with Orme-Sargent, who coula tell himvery litt.e It was not cear whether he wastoue an adviser or was to take over completecontrol. He has suggestea that he Shouldgoout there for a fortnight and then return.He would then say whether he was repared to ttake on the job and ii so state his require-ments. This idea did not very much appealto Orme-Sargent whose sole wish seemea to beto get him out to Greece, whether there wasa job to be done or not. Eventually he agreedto telegraph Wickham's proposals to RexLeeper.Tommy told me more about the camp Oilag 4Cwhere George Lascelles ana other notablesCatalogue Reference:KV14/196 as hostages.1u'He was anxious to know whether a message ofencouragement could be sent through to them.I advised him to apply to the DMI who wouldarrange it through M.I.9D.B. came to tell me that there was a proposalon foot to make Cavendish-Bentinck Peter LOX-ley's successor in SO far as the receipt o1S.S.,aterial was concemned. I said that Ithought it was important that he Should.alscontrol the job as Cadogan's principleP.A. Otherwise 50% of the value to us ofthe job carried by Loxley would go. It wasessential to have someboay who was lookingat all the stuff going through to Cadogan,in order that he could keep us informed anapass to us anything that concernea us.Fepruary 22ndI saw Maxwell about the LINDEMANS case. Iexplained to him the position and that weproposed to set W.J.Brown to witharaw hisquestion and to put down another asking theMinister for war to make a statement. I thenread over to Maxwell the statement which weproposed to mase ana told him that Hili o1the H I. was rather opposeu to our mentioningthat LINDEMANS had been brought to thiscountry. Maxweil said he did not reallymind about this but that if we could avoid itSO much the better.I had a long meeting with J.C. ,Herbert andJohn Marriott with regard to the future O1 B.lAJ.C. was very obstinate about our getting ridof any of the B.lA agents. We had suggested thaGelatine and Bronx could go. He felt howeverthat the, might come in useful in cireumstanceswhich we could not perhaps loresee. He diahowever agree to a consideraple reduction ofCatalogue Referenee:kw4/96continuation o1 thetraffic analysis which now seemea unnecessary.This should releas two officers ana perhapsthree female staff. He felt in general thatthe XX Committee woula have to go on.I had a talked with Charles and Harker about0.C. I think they are fairly convinced thata reorganisation on the lines OI Herbertismemo is necessary.I went over in the evening to see Mr.banyon,who deals with P.QLs in the W.0. I suggestedto him that he shoud get W.J.Brown to with-draw his question and putdown another. Heseemed to think the idea a good one.In the evening I saw John Booth, who wasextremely interesting about his work ana wantsme to visit the llth Armourea Division if Igo to Belgium. He has a tremendous admirationfor his own unit and in fact for Monty andthe British as a fighting force. He hasunIortunately very little to say for theAmericans. He says their staff Work is bad,theyre grossly over-organised anu haphazardin their methods and they have little driveexcept when Patton is behind them. He quotedan nstance where after pomparument on twosueeessive days they Faileu to aavance at all.A brigade of theArmoured Division then wentinto action and drove south or 4 miles. Inthe Ardennes they were caught completely onthe hop, ahving taken no precausions what-ever. John told me there was no possibleexcuse for not knowing what was going on infront of them. They clearly had no reeceparties out in front and no air reeee,other-wise they would have peen bounu to see thepanzer tracks. One oi the excuses for thedebacle given by Bradley that he was movinghis headquarters. This John says is typical.Catalogue Reference:KV14/196They have wonaerful equipment but no iaea o1how to use it. Whereas our armourea divisiona.command is in permanet touch with all hisunits if not with every vehicle, the Americansare generally out of touch. He described tome on very rough lines how an attack was made.First o1 all there is air bombardment for halfan hour, then al artillery pombarament. theinfantry then advances and takes the firstline which of course is not a line at allbut merely a series of posts. Tanks thengo through and endeavour to break up furtherlines to the rear. As soon as they come upagainst difficulties,the infantry are broughtin in relays and deploy for a mopping-up operation. >ometimes they will carry out as manyas 6 in one day. This involves the captureof anti-tank guns etc. and is done under afairly stiff barrage Known as a stonkingbarrage. In the bigaavance to Antwerp theArmoured Division got on to a stright roadand went hell for 1 ather, until they werestretched to their furthest limit. theydid on one occasion go as much as 50 milesin a night. They would almost certainlyhave gone on from Antwerp il they haa receiveathe order. Unfortunately they were kept hang-ing about for 6 days until it was too Late.It was generally felt that haa they got acrssas far as Arnhem they could probably haveturned the Rhine.Feoruary 2raI had a talk with Burt about the Black Market.He is still very worried about Ned Reidpassing his type of information to the PoliceBurt himself is likely to ramain here untilthe end of the war when he may well be posteaas C.C. to S.B.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/196J.C. has come in to tell me that Drew wantsBronx and Gelatine kept on to act as back-ground for his rocket deception. He believesthat this deception has succeeded in movingthe main point of impact about 6 miles in aN.E.direction.At the daily meeting we discussed the questionof O.S.S. agents going out oi this countryunder control. It was decideu that Hervertshould deal with the matter on the SOE panel.He should also ascertain the conditionsunder which they are trained.Tate has peen told to report on V.il. whichmay indicate that an improved form OI thisprojectile is to be sent over at some futuredate.The Spaniaras are asking for a Consul atTrinidaa. we are recormending strongly thatthis should be turned down.Garbo has been told to render a report aboutalleged concentrations on the east coast foran invasion of Holland,Dermark or elsewhere.The Germans appear to be extremely windyabout this.e have learned that Brandes has been instrue-ted by Berlin to send E2,000 through one ofhis agents to the Wings Club to pe collectedby Brutus. As we believe that Brandes! agentsare all notional it is not surprising thatthe money has not so far been received.Brandes himself will probably be on the spotin consequence:Sclater and 1 had lunch with M-E, when weaiscussea W/T security. I toia M-E that wewould be quite prepared to see a committee ofrepresentatives of the Service Depts. RSS andCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196ourselves, with a deci'sion that RSS shouldallocate 6 sets for search of civilian trafficand for taking a cross section of servicetraffic. I felt however that RSS shouldgo further than they have hitherto. The twosets that we have now are only allocate tolook after civilian traific as and when theycan be spared from other duties. This I didnot think was good enough. We atght to havea positive guarantee from RSS that all thesets would be permanently employed on our workNo variation of this should be made withoutour consent. M-E is prepareu to recommendthis but anticipates considerable oppositiorfrom Maltby and G-P.The Norwegian resistance have during a housesearch in Norway obtained the photostate Ofa letter from Viv.to Harker in 1937 askingabout a Jap named Byken Matsuaka, and hisset-up as an agent. There is no doubt that ththis document is a photostat copy of theoriginal which is still in the SIS fites.It is not our copy. We are trying to findout precise details about how it was obtained.SHAEF C.I. summary for the week ending l6thFeb. states that according to captured agentsnumerous parachute operations are in readinessand only awaiting suitable weather and air-craft. A Flying Fortreess operated bythe G.I.S. was stated to have the Americansignals code and American methoa of establish-ing identity with the ground. The Fortresshas compartments to prevent contact betweenthe different grades of agents to be dropped.There is an agency for sabotaurs to be para-chuted and then passed through the lines.An increased effort is being made to activiateand extend the stay-behind rtwork, with apossible long-term aim.

Many3agents are now given as: an aaditional missionthe assassination of persons of importance.The use of dogs as couriers is consideredprobable. One has been caught in the 6thArmy Group area. The use oi carrier pigeonsby agents is considerably increased. Thereare many instances of parachutes and equip-ment being found, the latter including smallprinting presses, mattresses ana marked maps.Reports point to greater GI.Se activity fromSpain. the Germans are relying increasinglyon the paniards Intelligence service to runagents for them. here are indications thatthe G.I.S. are utilising sources in neutrallegations in Paris for espionage purposes. Theinterrogation oIfeaptured 15 year old HitlerJugend reveals tha he attende a a schoolnear the Dutch border where 400 Simitar memberwere in training. Gestapo men are peingintroduced into the Kripo so that they cancontinue to work under its cover.February 24thBurt talked to me about the STYLES case whichseems to be going very well. STYLES hasapparently admitted that his story about aspy at the Midland Hotel in Birmingham wasa mares nest.Ribbentrop has told Hempel to circulatethrough trusted British and American sourcesa long stor about the hovrors that willbefall Europe if the Allies allow Russia tooverrun the country. This happened about thel6th, but 4 days later Hempel was told to donothing until he got further orders. Thestatement was interesting in that it allegedthat Molotov haa said positively that the USSRclaimed control of the Skagerack ana the hatte-gat. There was also a defi ite statementthat the Germans were in possession O1 certainCatalogue Reference:KVI4/196telegrams between Moscow and Sofia indicatingsinister intentions by the Russians. Titiisimpossible to say whether this is true orwhether telegrams have come into theirpossession by interception or through thehands of an agent.ISCOT discloses that the Russians areproceeding on precisely the same lines asthey dd before the establi shment OI theLublin Committee. They are preparing anAustrian Committee which is to take overthe reins o1 government.The DG has seen Cadogan ane also Finaater.I gather that the latter is to conduct theenquiry into the affairs OI this office anaSIS but that at the moment he is examiningthe question of the return of Gibraltariansfrom N.Ireland to the ROCK. He is going toGib. this week but will be back in about10 days.26th February.Ronnie Haylor same in to talk about his rela-tions with the War Room. He thought that heought to tie up a little more closely withtheir affairs as they might well affect thecontrol commission at a later stage. I torhim I would speak to TAR about this.I attended the Firth Committee. It wasgenerally agreed that the present machinerywas satisfactory but needed official sanctionand an increase of monitoring facilities.The responsiblity for co-orainating activitiesfor monitoring the civilian circuits andalso for taking something of a cos-sectionof service transmissiosns will be with us. M-Esaid tha t he would recommend our being allo-cated 6 sets for this work. I asked whetherCatalogue we should Reference:kV/4/196n Reference have antee that these setswould be permanently employed on that work.I thought this was absolutely necessary,otherwise we should never know where we were.I hau in mind of course Maltby's habit ofusing these sets for all sorts of purposeswithout consulting us and doing so freely-in the past.February 27thJohn Marriott has just come back from Paris.de tells me that Bardet and Kieifer of theGILBERT case have both been release and thatBardet and several othertoughs have beenround to DicK Warder's price Waving revoiversand demanding DSOS. They have eviuentiy beentold by the French that their continuedinternmentis due to the British. John thinksthat we must reallyrwrite of the Brutuscase.I talked to Kim Philby who came to see meabout the amalgamation project. I told himquite frankly that what wie really worried usmore than anything was the prospect of beingplaced under the extremely unsatisfactorypeople who held the direeting positions inSIS. we felt that thus woula be a positivedisaster. Unless therefore they ail handedin their resignations with some prospect oftheir being accepted, it was difficult forus to contemplate a merger. Kim aseu whetherI should mind his passing that on to Arnod-Forster. I said that I could see Bo objectionwhatever. I had alreaay mentioned it toArnold-Forster ana so had Dick Butler.A telegram has come from Tim Airy to say thathe has been appointed head of the War Roomfor SEAC,with Cass as his deputy. It Lookst ereiore as ii we were virtually in commana01 C I. for SEAC.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/196February 28thJ.C. came to confess that he had been to seeDrew and Finatater Stewart about the sugeesteudissolution o1 B.lA.

He isjust back from Paris where he has beenworsing with Victor. He was anxious ifpossible for Teresa to work in the publica-tions section and not under Milmo. He had beertalking to TAR apout this but had evidentlynot made much heaaway. I said I would speakto TAR. Clearly Milmowants to controlsabotage. He has always trieu to get hisIingers on it berore out without success.On the other hand if Victor has ot got histentacles on the cases it may be thatcertainmatters Of importance will not see the lightof day. What Victor's oition vis-a-visthe War Room is ultimately to pe I am notquite clear. He is running a training schooland he has to supply the field with allinformation of importance which he may getfrom the interrogation of prisoners in theforward area. Many of the se prisonerswill never be sent back,either because theFrench or the Americans do not wish to handthem over. Hampshire was full o1 admirationfor the work Victor was doing and for histireless energy.March lstI had a long talk with Burley about thearrival of seamen from the low Countries.explained to him that I did not think thepresent situation was satisfactory.

It may be that the notesare forged. In any case an iniringement ofcurrency regulations has been committed. Thiswill puton the wrong foot when heis interrogated. The French are collaboratinquite well in this caseI had a long session wit} Bertram-Ede-apothe future of 0.C. I tola him that in reach-ing a decision I hau been governed mainly bya feeling that it was impossible lor 0.C.to know more about the Mid East than AlecKellar; that personnel and policy, intelli-gence and administration, were all inextric-ably mixed up. If therefore 0.C. aid morethan pure administration, namely the procurirof equipment and So on, when requesteu, theywould be going out to see governors etc. withhalf-knowledge, and would pe bound to be rawinto discussions on matters concerning whichthey would not be competent to speak. Allthis Seemed to me to ring quite true. I hadtherefore put the matter tov Hart,who had atfirst been inclined to think thata section carrying some oi the present functionswas necessary. After reading treilaris reporthowever he had come definiteiy to the conclu-sion that if O.C. hanuled policy and personieCatalogue Referencexl4ngsinteliigence was O1 anys'simportance, they woula be certain to COue togrief..

We agreed Iinalyto differ. Ee wili put uprhis views ana-Ishall then put mine. I expect the DG wilirefer us both to his original circular whichdoes not in my view provide a proper solutionMarch 2ndI had a talk with TAR. It appears to be quiteimpossible to obtain any accommodation forthe War-Room. He hs also rather worriedabout getting information back i'rom theFrench. There is evidently considerable-diriculty. also endless troubles betweenthe Americans as to what body is allowed tosee what type of information. TAR welcomedONI but this was immediately opposed by OSSas was also a suggestion that the FBI mightbe brought in. -Meanwhile G.2 wont let OSS seeDEGS which means that they cannot see certainof the ISOS cards which have DEGS on therback.At the daily meeting today Mrs Spring readouta that Ostro haspeensCatalog Refeteace: ritish subject in conmjunction with the International Police.

The DMI seemscontent to leave the training of C.I.stafisto us. He was not unreceptive to the ideaof a very small nucleus from the InteiligenceServices in M.I. to give continuity to the wor]He thought however that as MI as a whole wouldbe so small the numbers from the secretintelligenee organisations would have to bevery strictly limited, unless the departmentwas going tobe thrown out of balance.I talked to the D.G. about Eae's draft letterto Henderson. The DG haa instructed Eae totell Henderson to get into airect touch withthe FBI and to ask them whether they objectedto their reports going to BSC. The DG alsointimateathat he did not think that CyrilMills should have anything to do with thenegro problem. I pointed out to the DG thatCyril himself had made it very clear thathaving fixed up the liaison he wishea tofade out o1 the picture and that Hendersonand Seal-Coon would in future deal direct onnegro matters. Only if things went wrongwould Cyril step in again on account ofhis very intimate relations with the FBI.AS egaras BSC, Cyrik had made it etearthat when he discussed the matter with Ladathe latter would not countenance. any ofhis reports on the negro movement going toStephenson. I thought therefore that itwould be foolish For Henderson to re-penCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196this matter. The D.G. seemed to think thatCyril was exaggerating this point and isevidently anxiousfor Henderson to go toWashington and thrash it out. I think howeverthat he has finally decided to drop this idea.I discussed with Milmo the question in theHouse about the numper o1 spies convicted. Itwould be awkward to give the Figure with thenationalities, since for example MENEZES wasconvincted but no publicity was given.Wu want the Germans to think that peo lecan be executed here wi thout anything appearingin the Press, and we wish to keep them ignoranor guessing about the numbers.

It wasdecided to give the facts of the ease toAdmiral Thompson and recommend a prosecutionunder the D-R.March 3raDick has sent me the M.I.R.S. report whichgives the German views of the allied landingaccounts in Normandy, of based the invasion on an analysis operations.Referring of 23 Germanto secrecy and the factor of surprise it isstated that these were strictly safeguarded inall preparatory work and in tYe landing opera-tion itself. In general security appears tohave been successful. Even though a reportmentions that information filtering throughfrom England on landing exercises gave theCatarogueRelerenee:i4i1bon about alterationsin allied landing procedure, neverthelesstime and place of the Normandy landing evident-ly took the derenders by surprise. The exer-cise referred to was presumably the one carriedout in the Channel when it is known thatthe proposal to land at low tide was givenaway by bad wireless discipline. reports hadapparently reached the Germans from agentswhich statea that 300-ton cement-carryingboats were being built. The Germans believedthat these were to be used for blocking theentrances to harbours. They were oi coursethe Mulberries. I am inclineu to think thatthis deception was put across by ourselvesalthough the building of Mulberries might eas-ily have come to the knowledge OI the Germansthrough Irish workmen returning on leave.The fact that they were being made was widelyknown in this country.The Germans anticipatea large-seale operationsonly where the fol owing conditions were ful-filled: 1. in the neighoourhood OI at eastone good harbour. (2) in an area with a wideforeshore (3) in deep water without reefs orshoals (4) where strong currents and surfwere absent (5) in fair calm weather (6) witha rising tide, and (7) at new moon. In factthe landings commenced at full moon, awayfrom harbours, at some points on sheer cliffsand in water stated by German naval expertsto be impassible by reason of under-waterreefs and strong currents. -astly the opera-tion was carried out in a strong wind with lowcloud ceiling, a rough sea and at low ebb.Bad weather proved no obstacle nor did thedifficult water which was navigated wi with thexcellent seamenship and probably, in theGerman view, with the help of ocam Bretonpilots. Cliffs were overcome by means ofrope ladders which were fired by shells, stuckin the cliff ana unrollea. By landing on theCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/196ebb tide it was passible to pass foreshoreobstacles almost without casualties whilebright moonlight facilitated the previousdropping of airborne troops on terrain whichhad been considered unsuitable for air landingand had not therefore been blocked with ob-stacles. The paratroopers alarm was not givenas the landing was not believe possible.The first paratroopers droppea were taken forbaled out airmen. Thus it came about thatin spite of all subsequent attempts atdenial by the High Commana,, the force guardinthe coastal fortifications were taken bysurprise. Indeed in the sector of the 716thinfantry division not even the command to stanby was given when the First landing troopscame ashore. Local and divisional reserveswere still building defences and suddenlyfound themselves in the miast oi an engagement.The evacuation of labour units ana civiliansas planned proved impossible. British airoperations uputo a distance of 130 miles tothe rear, caused a shortage of ammunition atstrong points and by the second aay all centreof resistance had run out of ammunition. Minefields in front of the shore were mostly blownup as were also all position-finding installa-tions.The air-borne landings which protected theflanks of the operation and begun at nightpaund 1 am. on the 6th June were at firstmistaken for target marking operations,althaghno bombing ensued in the area. The Firstallied naval formations were sighted between3 and 4 am., 12-16 miles north of the OrmeEstuary. With the first light, 5 am on the6 th June, there began a terrible bombardmentby naval guns of all calibres,combining withthe air bombing which if possible had reachedCatafogue ReferencetRV4/19e 14/196 All reports agreethat the concentration and effectiveness63-of the naval and air bombarament were fargreater than previous ex erience in Italy.the number of guns employed was estimatedat 400 to545 pieces. The naval bombaramentwhich opened at various points in successionlasted for about hali an hour, anu from thenon smoke shells were employed. The effectof this bombardment was to destroy all mine-fields and barbed wire, all field worKS andmost of the conerete emplacements, all flame-throwers, goliath remote control tanks, whichnever came into actionat all, and all signalscommunications, searchlight cables and positior-finding installations. The moral efrecto1 the naval guns was tremendous ana gave thedefenders a feeling of utter helplessness whichin the case oi inexperiencea troops causedfainting or indeeu eomptete paralysis. Theinstinct of self-preservation urove theirduty as soldiers to right anu uestroy theenemy completely out of their minas.Disembarkation took place on a broaa frontat ebb tide, leaving the foreshore ary forabout a depth of approximately 700-850 yas.The marine commanuos and Rangers battalionswere the first to land, remove the remainingmines and open lanes through the Ioreshoreobstacles, marking them with flags. They aresaid to have suffered fairly heavy losses.A quarter of an hour later came the landingcraft with infantry and tanks. The divisionalsectors covered about 22 miles. In some casesconsiderable gaps were left between thedifferent divisional sectors. The firstarmoured divisions were already landing bythe eveing of the first day. yThe Germans haacalculated that heavy material woula be unload-ed only after several hours So that the mainrole for smashing the invasion wouta fall tothe long-range coast artillery,while localans strategic reserves Iinsshed off the troopsCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196who landed. In reality most of the coastalbatteries were eliminated by the bombardmentand those surviving were paralysed by smokescreens. The starting fire of the warshipswas extremely accurate especially when theywere at anchor and made movement o1 strategicreserves impossible within range of their-guns, 20 miles inland. It is true that asis to fire emphasised and had the to ships change were their very anchorage vulnerableor their course immediately they themselveswere fired upon. Naval guns,throughartillery spotting aircraft, captive balloonsetc. were in a position to eliminate everyimportant target and individual heavy weapon.Co-operatior between allied air and groundforces was complete and the allies absoluteair mastery re eraineu so unassailable thatthe German soldiers felt completely helplessand kept on asking where the GAF had got to.High praise was given by the German 6thparachute rifle regiment's commander to themarksmanship OI the American parachute air-borne troops. It was not until the Germanregiment was later opposed to ordinary Ameri-can infantry whose shooting the GermanCommander considered to be inusually bad,that his men regained their seli-coniidence.Dummy parachuters filled with explosive haasome measure of success in misleading theGermans. The dropping of real parachutistin the middle of a panzer aivison just asit was developing a successful counter-attackwas extremely eIrective. German W/T trafficwas closely observed and battery headquarterswas located through the detection Of their W/Tstations by allied direction finders. ourseparate attempts were nade,according to theGermans, to interfere with the fire controlof heavy weapons and the tactical hanaling oftank forces by means of false orders givenby W/T. The Germans complained apout theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/196state of their troops many of whom weresuffering from overstrain as a result ofincessant labouring on field Works. The17 year old recruits even went to sleepwith weariness. In the front line a highpercentage were convalescent or recruits withonly 4 weeks training. Commanuers couldnot rely on their sub-ordinates ana in manyinstances themselves evinced a remar haplelack of initiative and decision. one of thepanzer bataltions employed as a fighting unitwas equopped with old French tanks not morethan 32 of which were in running order when theinvasion started. The battalion had Frerchlight guns wi thout sights and obsolete rifies.70% of the M/T could not be used on accountof tyre-shortage. The German front linetroops did not appear to have a very highopinion of their close combat weapons.Most battle reports express a feeling ofcomplete helplessness in the face of alliedsuperiority which the Germans attempteu tocombat by quite inadequate make-shiits. Thefrequently misused "point O1 main efrort"was recommended as a universal remedy. thepoint o1 main effort originally conceivea bythe Germans as an ollensive concept, to builtup over-whelming local superiorityat the pointintended for a break-through, is in deiencea confession of German inferiority in allfields, and attempts to gain equality at afew points at least. On the question of tac-tics the German commanders seem to differconsiderably. Some of them think that thedefence ought to have bee mar e in depth,withstrong points which shoula hola at alt costsand provide a convenient starting point lorlocal counter-attacks. Some approve ana othersdeery connected trenches.

Of this number no less than 71 havebee sent to us by the Armies under SHAEFcommand all of them in the latter 6 monthsof the ear. The remaining 45 bouies whichhave been aamitted to 020 have been derivedfrom the usual channels. 31 bodies were ad--mitted prior to D.day. During the jear therehave been 12 enemy agerits charged with espion-age or sabotage missions against the U.K.Only 3 of the aboe agents could have beenregarded as having been primarily charge withanti-invasion assignments. In the second halfof 1944 there were no known cases o1 the enemysending an agent wit a mission against theU.K. The reasons for the above may pe la) thatthengeneral ban imposed early in the yearon travel of cecruits for the allied forcesand others to the UK effectively blocked oneof the channels most freaiently used bythe Germans.(b) that there was a lack offacilities open to the enemy for despatchingagents following upon his loss of control ofthe Franco-Spanish boraer.(c) that the enemywas generally satisfied with his existingorganisation with the country. 20 cases wereinvestigated of persons captured abroad, thisfigure contrasting with corresponding fiureof 50 in the previous year. The DSO controlCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/196points have ceasd to provide the same yieldof espionage bodies as heretorore ana inparticular there has been a noted falling offboth qualitatively and quantitatively of theproduct from Trinidad. We have had 7 agentsfrom Iceland whose advent strongly suggestedthat the Germans were expecting at leastdiversionary or subsidiary operations to belaunched from Iceland against Norway. Asmall number of cases have peen sent to usfrom AFHQ. The case of MANFREDI was of out-standing importance in as much as AFHQ,haVfailed to break this man, were at a particularly crticial moment beginning to doubt theinformatio that derived from ISOS.

The Americans inFrance are assisted ana sometimes obstructedby a formidable Frerch organisatior and theFrench do not tend to look with favour uponbodies being sent to this country for inves-tigation.

A total of 88 key-point incidents were caused of which 4 wereof ma terial significance and 1,256 Fatal ana2,774 serious casualties were causea,oi whichthe considerably greater proportion were dueto V.2. "he total number of V.l plotted inoperation during the quarter was 771 and thetotal number of such incidents 306. Thehighest number in any one attack was 62 onthe night of 18/19 Dec. Except for onemorning, 31/10, all the activity took placeat night. Usually the aircrait approached upto about 50 miles oIf the coast 01 Bast Angliaand despatched the bombs at London. Excep-tionally they came up towards the E.coast anthe estuary. When the quarter began marksman-ship with earrier-borne flying-pombs wasestimated at approximatel 16%. In the attackon London during the 3 months reviewed, marks-manship was 20% in October, 10jo in Nov. and9go in Dec. 15% for the whole quarter. Onthe night of 23/24 Dec. the enemy suddenlyswitched his attack to the inaustrial area ofManchester and met with some success. Noincident occurred in Manahester itself butout of a total o1 29, 16 were located within20 miles of the centre of the city.
