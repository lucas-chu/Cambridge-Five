Suggested to Harkerthat he should see H.O. and find out whetherthey approved all the cases we have putbefore them. If so, do they agree to ourgiving the names of these people to C.C.s andasking them to keep the individuals more orLess under observation from now onwards.Ne can I think assume that nearly all Germansfeaturing on our Suspect Index will havegone prior to a declaration of war. Theonly possible exceptions are Frl.AHLFELDT andFrl. BINZER, both of whom are remaining, itis thought only because they expeet that aswomen they will be repatriated. Discussedwhether it was worth while getting aDeportation Order against them. It wasgenerally agree that this would serve no veyuseful purpose.The case of KUCHENMEISTER was also discussed,but we felt that the chances were that hehad already gone and that there was verylittle that he could pass on to the Germansthat he has not given them already. Theonly thing he could possibly report would beincreased activity which on the whole mightbe a good thing. He must already know thelocation of all our armament factories.Z.O.R. rang up to say that Baron de VILLARSwas again in this country and anxious toget Lazard Bros. to purchase 60-70,000Polish Mausers.

VILLARS does no t think anything willhappen for at least 15 days and that therewill be time to get the arms to this countryI told Z.O.R. he would have to consult theF.O. in this matter. Lazaras apparentlyhave block currency in Poland and would bequite prepared to make the purchase if therwas a reasonable chance of getting the armsover here. Z.O.R. said that if he could beof any use he would be only too pleased todo anything.Vivian Seymer rang me up to say that he knewa Miss Dorothy Reynolds of 5 De enmark Avenue,Wimbledon, .W.19, who was employed by M.I.5at Plymouth in the last war.

It seemed possible thatDowning St. might be making use Of him.Suggested therefore to Harker that he chouldfind out from Ball if this were so.I have suggested to all B.2. sections thatthey should make out a list as far aspossible in order of priority of such casesas can be best cleared up through directinterrogation immediately after the out-break of war.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1854.P.M.The following is a resume of special materiup to about ut midday on August 27th:It seems that Hitler's demands are that thePoles should accept before negotiations arereopened the cession of Danzig, and a roadthrough the Corridor, and that Britain shouannul her guarantee to Poland.In the opinion Of the Polish Ambassador,the British reply will be firm, but he woulprefer it to be firmer. The French reply,which it seems has already been give, ismuch sharper in tone. Everybody seems to tthat Italy is doing her best to avoid war aand the Italian Embassy in their usual presreports have said that things are slightlybrighter and that anglo-Italian relations anot strained.The POlish Ambassador is of the opinion thathe English are waiting to have their replcommented on by Roosevelt and that they arenot only working for today but for history,and have an eye on the future, say 6 monthsor a year. He does not think that it willlead to a peaceful solution.It seems that the French Minister's converttion wit 1 Hitler on the 26th was completelynegative. The French believe that the Turnare behaving satisfactorily and that thediplomatic atmosphere is distinctly clearelThe Germans hoped the Russian Pact wouldcreate a disturbance, but Paris and Londonare firm and thus all have not reacted asexpected. The situation with the Far Eastis improved and it is possible that theFrench may abandon the Chinese and changeCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1853their attitude in favour of the Japanese.The French believe that the Poles are readyto discuss matters or to put forward sugges-tions, but only on the assumption that theyare not threatened.The German report on Sundayls British pressis that there is no opposition to theGovernment and that if the latter refuseHitler's proposals the Press will support it.n the opinion of one member of the GermanEmbassy it was possible at 1.27 p.m. on the27th August "that the peak had been crossed"but he hardly dared to say so.D.S.S.heard at about 4 p.m. that D.M.O. & I.was optimistic about the situation, basinghimself to some extent on the fact that therehad been no further movements of German t roopsduring the last 24 hours. He thought thatthis was very significant.Harker saw Van, who seeed slightly morehopeful. It seems quite definite that thereis to be no Munich. Van thought that if thereis no war within the next 48 hours the crisiswould peter out.August 29th.A.M.We informed D.N.I. a short t ime ago that asa result of a speech of Lord Stanhope'smentioning the efficiency of our submarinedetectors, the German Intelligence Servicehad become very interested in this matter, asthey themselves had nothing of the kind.Enquiries made by a naval Officer show thatthe Asdic Gear is being fitted to trawlersCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1856in a number of ports by naval ratings.

There have beenrecriminations between Party men and non-Party men. Non-Party men are saying:We always told you that you would get usinto this mess, and you will be the Firstpeople to suffer for it." P. has theimpression that we have got Hitler onthe run and that nothing should be doneto provide him with a golden briage tomake his getaway.Discussed this morning with Holt-Wilson uIand Cooper the liome Secretary's sugges-tion that tribunals should be set up todeal with enemy aliens. My persona]feeling is that enemy aliens should beinterned and that they should be calledupon to show cause why they should bereleased. The present suggestion, whichenvisages a tribunal in each police dis-trict, will not in Iy view be able todeal with all the cases for at least 8months. In the meantime the Germans willhave an opportunity of working on enemyaliens in this entry and organising theminto some kind of intelligence service.From an M.I.5. point of view it would befar prererable to have them put away. Iwas told however that it had already beendecided by the C.I.D. that interument ofall enemy aliens was impossible and un-desirable and that there was nothingCatalogue Reference:kV6n18EThe suggested tribunals are to be establishein all egistration districts, although itis thought that the same chairman mightcover several tribunals where alien popula-tion was small. he Chairman, who willrepresent the H.O. is to be a barrister ora man with legal knowledge. Othees on thetribunal will be the local registrationofficer who should be secretary, the C.C.or his nominee, a representative of theMinistry of Labour, and a staff officerfrom the local command who will representall three services. Procedure will be afollows: The C.C will supply a complete listof male enemy aliens ower 60. They will bedivided into categories and dealt with inthe following order (1) Technicians (2)Ordinary aliens (3) Refugee Technicians(4) Ordinary Refugees. Careful instructionswill have to be given to the tribunal as tothe most suitable lines for interrogation.The tribunals will recommend either intern-ment, full control as for enemy aliens, orint termediate control. Any information inpossession of M.I.5. will go to the C.C.concerned who will lay it before the tribunalAny appe als. for revision by local tribunalwillbe dealt with by a special centraltribunal set up under the H.0., the HomeSecretary's decision being the final oneCzechs arre to be dealt with on an entirelseparate basis and aliens other than enemyaliens under the ordinary Aliens Tribunalsset up under the H.0.

There is nowconsiderable concern as by so doing theymay give away our embarkation ports, which wehave been trying to keep secret. The matteris eing dealt with. The suggestion was putforward that we should try and get out mis-leading information through double-cross age ntsor by other means. Allen,\ who spoke to me, andI both agreed that it would be better to doothing.Special material of the 28th contained nothingof articular interest. Most Embassies appearto be gloomy about the prospeets and feel thatnegotiations have reached an impasse. Theydo not see how Hitler can recede from theposition he has taken up.Cooper showed me his draft of the meetingabout the tribunals for dealing with enemyaliens. He had inserted a para suggestingthat aliens should be allowed to be legallyrepresented. I said that this would createan impossible situation but that I would referthe matter to Colonel Holt-Wilson. I alsotold him that on reconsideration we feltthat the officers from Commands would be oflittle value and that there might be consider-able such difficulty in irs supplying some 240 ofpoints officers. when talking He said Maxwell. he would mention theseCatalogue Reference:KV74/1851D1Discussed with White and Hunter the questionof observation of suspect Germans.

He seems very confidentthat disintegration has set in and evensuggests that if the order were now given toit is doubtful whether the Germans wouldmarch. It is difficult to estimate how muchhis views are based on documents or on gossipin diplomatic circles. It is also difficultto assess the significance of the new WarCouncil from which Goebbels,Hirmler and RibbenCatalogue Reference:KV/4/185((trop are all excluded. It may be one furthermove in the general game of bluff, or it mayindicate that there has been some sort ofserious internal dissension.The Russian view of the Soviet-German pactwould appear from the Communist press to beroughly as follows:Stalin has made a master stroke and driven awedge into the Anti-Comintern Pact. Thispart is in no way incompatible with a fullmutual assistance pact between Russia,England a,and France, since such a pact would notnecessarily be directed against anyboay. Iftherefore this pact were signed before Germanycommitted an act of aggression against Poland,Clause 4 of the German-Soviet Pact would beinoperative and Russia would be at liberty torender assistance to ourselves, the Poles orthe French. No comments are made on thepostponement of the ratification Of theGerman-Soviet Pact, which is extremelydifficult to explain, unless it is meant toencourage us to make a Mutual Assistance Pactor to stiffen Polish resistance in order thatwar in the west will be more likely. Theeffect must at any rate be to leave theGermans in some state of uncertainty.DAWKES heard from KUTZNER, who has given himan address in Oslo to which to communicatehis reports, and also certain other eportswhich he will receive from Palestine.The following is a summary of special materialfor 29.8.:-The Poles seem rather pleased that Hitler isincreasing his demands beyond the question ofDanzig as they evidently feel that this willCatalogue Reference:KV/4/185I 2prevent the British from pressing them tocompromise over Danzig. Beck and the PolishAmbassador feel that our note to Hitler isperhaps to some extent an attempt to forceaihim to open direct negotiations with thePoles. They hope that this demarche will notbe misunderstood and that the Germans willnot regard it as weakness.Summary for the 30.8:-The French seem to think that ltaly conte.ates neutrality with a view to helpingGermany against the west after Germany hasdealt a blow at the Poles. They realisehowever that Italy might change her mind.Maiski says that according to unofficialcircles in Moscow the Russians are with-holding ratification of the German-SovietPact because they wish to exercise certainpressure on Germany. If the treaty is notratilied it falls to the ground. It seems tthat although the treaty is operative at themoment the Clauses regarding one year'snotice before cancellation do not come intoforce until after ratification. Maiski hasapparently allowed journalists to publishthe fact! K.x This is the view of an importSoviet diplomat in London. It would setherefore that he must be acting on insructions from Moscow but with what purposein view is not clear.Harker saw Van today, and gave him U.35'slatest report. He says he has had it con-firmed from a number Of sources that theGermans have got the jitters.

The purpose of the Bureau is toobtain information from existing French agentsoperating through Scandinavian countries andto recruit such agents from neutral seamenothers who may be thought suitable. Forhis purpose it is necessary for them to havea close liaison with ourselves and have thenecessary facilities at ports through oursecurity officers and the immigrationauthorities.

This was done and the telegramwas sent off about 11 a.m.D.S.S. suggested to Commissioner that he mightconsider having up Sir Oswald Mosley and Harry PollittCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18516and asking them what their attitude is and that oftheir party in the present situation. It was thoughtthat in this way one might get some public declarationof policy from them which would help us and the Policein dealing with the Fascist and Communist problem.The Commissioner thanked D.S.S. for the suggestion,He was actually at the time considering what courseof action he should take with regard to both parties.He had come to the conclusion that for the time be'it would be better to wait and see whether theyinfringed the law in any way.

The responsibility for any mishapin the factory would have to lie entirely with theinistry ofSupplies, and as soon as the man hascompleted his work for the W.O. he would be internedas a technician.

Maxwell is averse to any steps being takento nsttuct people in the Services to lay off theiralien domestics. He wans them to be dealt withby the tribunals in due course. My feeling is thatwe should press the three Services to get ridof enemy alien servants whether employed in oroutside barracks, and that any other alien servantsshould be vetted. At present the Army and Air Forcewill not allow enemy alien servants in barracksand alien servants only after being vetted.

Germany intends after the defeatof Poland to start intensive propaganda inFrance to dissuade the French f rom fightingfor British Imperialism. This will befollowed immediately by the putting forwardof peace proposals by Mussolini.Another report from S.I.S. by a diplomat.of a neutral state more or less confirmsthis view but adds that just before theachievement of final success by the Germans,the Russians would make a token advance rightalong the Eastern border, not really SO muchto help Germany, as to make sure that theGermans did not come too far a cross in thedirection of the U.S.S.R. After this therewill be a terrific drive for peace by theDuce and the Pope, and if this is turned downItaly will come in on the German side.U.35's special source considers that ourleaflet policy has been a failure.

He had notrealised that about 50,000 were at large andthat little was known about their antecedents.He has evidently formed a bad impressionof Cooper, from whom he could get no sensibledirection. He had not seen our recomenda-tions as to the lines interrogations were totake.

Thecurious thing was that one of the names wasspelt in the English way. He felt convincedthere must be a leakage going on fromStephenson's office and it could only bea matter of time before he was discovered anddealt with. The general impression is thatthe whole situation had rather got on hisnerves and that he felt he could not go on.His servant was magnificent and apparentlyarranged every detail of P's departure.P. had played up 100% until the momenthe left the Legation. The Germans at thHague must now be scratching their headswondering how much has gone west.We had a meeting of the German sections whenit was decided that all cases for actionunder D.R. would be submitted to me and thatwhenever people were interned under RoyalPrerogative or 18b notification should bemade to Stephens who will keep a completelist showing names and places of internment.The status of Danzigers was discussed with-out any very conclusive result except thatas far as we can ascertain from the TreatiesDept. F.0., they should technically beregarded as aliens and not as enemy aliens.In the middle of the meeting a small bOTstuck his head into the: room and said"Have you any dirty towels?"A man called John Swift, a citizen of Eire,went out to Amsterdam by air yesterday. Thecase had been r eferred thus over the tele-phone by the Permit Office wit th insufficientdetails. It now transpires that he receiveda visa in Dublin as late as 22.8.39 from theGerman Consul. When he went out he saidthat he was connected with underground T.U.movements. We are going to have him searchedCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18513and interrogated when he comes back, and Ihave written to Archer about it. We shallobviously have to be very careful aboutEire citizens visiting the continent.SEPTEMBER 16thThe Oxford Don, who is a real tiger,brought me a case of a German concerningwhom nothing is known but who had annoyed theS.C.0. at Southampton by wandering aboutwhile troops were embarking. The Oxford Donrecommended his immediate internment. Whilecordially agreeing I felt that we were onlynibbling at the problem. It seemed highlydesirable at this stage that any enemy aliensin the vicinity of ports where troop move-ments were going on should be interned forth-with. Consulted D.D.S.who finally agreedthat we should write a letter to Maxwell.Later however he spoke to Maxwell on thetelephone. Maxwell was obviously worried atthe suggestion as he thought it might betaken as an excuse by certain C.C.s to orderwholesale internments throughout the country.He consented however to something of thekind being sent to certain C.C.S on the under-standing that they would only act where theyhad reasonable grounds for suspecting thatan alien was taking an undue interest inservice matters. This seems to be the thinend of the wedge and after onsultation withAllen we decided to drive it well home bydrafting a letter for the H.O. to send out toall C.C.s and which we hoped would cover themin interning alien enemies who were over-inquisitive regarding any works of importancethroughout the country. D.D.S. is now tryingto gild this pill for H.O. consumption. Ifit goes through we shall have more or lesstorpedoed the whole tribunal system.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/185luNorman Kendal spoke to me about the case ofBernard WEISS, ex-Berlin Police Chief whohas been interned. We have agreed torelease him and have informed the H.O.For some reason however Kendal or hisdeputy Howe wish to be present at theinterrogation of any enemy aliens sent upfrom ports to Cannon Row. There does notseem to be any objection from our poin'of view but it seems to me that theyare likely to waste a great deal of thtime, and that if one Or other of themcannot make himself available the arrange-ment may be very inconvenient. I am notworrying, because I think by the timeStephens has interrogated an alien inGerman (which neither of them understand)for two hours, they will find the proceed-ings very boring and give up the arrange-ment.The Oxford Don has gone off the deep endand has instructed D.4 Branch to issue acircular that all Danzigers should beregarded as enemy aliens. This is indirect contradiction to the F.0. view.The necessary adjustments are now beingmade.Total number of arrests to date is now226, 24 being still at large.SEPTEMBER 17thWe received news at 9 a.m. that the Russianshad crossed the POlish border at 4 a.m.Later in the day in was announced that theRussians had taken this action since Poland'sovernment no longer existed and it wasnecessary that the Russiansminorities inCatalogue eReterence:RV4/18t protected.ys.scussed the question of Russian suspects wiwith particular reference to R.O.P.

Pressure was alsobeing brought to bear on the French. ThePoles were to be given aeroplanes and wouldsupply the pilots. The Air Ministry wereevidently doubtful about the value of thisand raised difficulties about the inadequacyof the landing grounds. It seemed to thePoles that the view of the British was tha timmediate help to the Poles was not of greatpractical value, that the war might lastthree years, when Poland would reap thebenefit of victory. In other words theBritish Govt. could not see their way tothrowing good money after bad.SEPTEMBER 18thJohn SWIFT, the Irishman who said he wasconnected with the Underground T.U.Movementin Germany, returned yesterday. He had inhis possession a letter of introduction fromthe German Bakers Union dated 23rd August1939. As he received his visa from theGerman Legation in Dublin on the 22nd, itwould seem that he could not have got it onthe S trength of this letter.

An official incharge of the Dust Destroyer looked overthe literature and refused to burn it. Itappears that the Japanese contractor hadreceived the documents from the JapaneseEmbassy. A recent B.J. shows that Embassiesabroad have been instructed to destroy anypapers that they do not feel it essentialto keep and to make special a rrangements forthe safety of confidential documents.Samples of the literature are being sentup for our inspection.We have a report that the Italian dualnationals are leaving this country on theirItalian passports and we assume that they willprobably be coming back on their Britishnes. There is no suggestion that theyare being called up. It seems more likelythat they think Italy will be a quieter placthan London for the duration of the war.An illicit wireless station within 10 milesof this office has been picked up. It isin touch with at least 5 other stations,one of which is in France, and is sendingfrequent messages by day and night. OurD.F.stations have completely failed to locateit, although signals were very strong. ItCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18548is believed that the balloon barrage maybe having a serious effect on D.F.work.V.V. told me that David Boybe was theMystery Man who went to Germany just be-fore the outbreak of war and that hispurpose was to contact a certain Germangeneral whom it was thought might lead arevolt in the German Army.P. and U.35 are considering a schemeby which P. should come right out inthe open and denounce the German regimein the press and on the wireless.I heard of a Greek the other day tryingto get back to his own country. He hadto obtain about 5 permits and his greatdifficulty was to get them to synchronise.A delay of 48 hours in the sailing of hisboat has now thrown him completely outof gear.A party of 6 Germans, members of the crew,was taken off the Roosevelt. The Americanshave asked that they should be sent backon the Manhattan. I spoke to HerschelJohnson and explained to him our difficul-ties. I also told him that there had beenan ugly scene in Southampton whenmembers of the crew of Manhattan had titthreatened to force the ganway. Wehave agreed to let them go back on theManhattan but I have asked Herschel Johnsonto persuade the United States Lines torefrain from sending German crews tothis country. I also told him that beforelong neutral crews would not be allowedto land or to be visited on board.Spoke Jock Balfour,American Section F.0.,and told him what had happened andCataloguesReterenee:v/4/f85.0 might usefully41inform all neutrals of what they mightexpeet in the course of the next 10 days.He entirely agreed. I SO informed Agam.S.I.S. reports that the Russo-urkish Pactwill not affect relations with G.B. andFrance. The French General Staff regardour leaflets as a failure. They thinkbombs should have been dropped firstand leaflets afterwards.S.I.S. report states that if Turkeybecomes involved in war with Germanythe U.S.S.R. Pact with Germany wouldbecome invalid. Likewise if Germany'attacks Roumania the Russo-German Pactbecomes invalid.SEPTEMBEF 19th.Lord Hankey has been instructed by theP.M. to enquire into the possib lity ofleakage of informa ation from the U.K. toGermany and suggest neasnres to top it.His first step was to enquire into themethods of wireless interception. Thisled to a wrangle between W.0. and S.I.S.Lord H. had not realised that MI5 werenot responsible for wireless int ercepti onin this country. We have been sked(a) to put up a brief note showing thevarious methods by which informationcould reach Germany and any suggestionswhich we may have to prevent such leakage;(b) a note on Eire in the same sense and(c) a note on any a aditional powers re-quired to search and arrest.

My owI view is thateravelling should be severely restricted andthat permits should only be granted when thetourney is definitely shown to be in thenational interest. There are constant appli-ions from Italians who want to g0 for aholiday. We are turning a11 these down.We have also had a case of an American stu-dent who wanted to go to Dublin. As visasfrom abroad are no longer being given to stu-dents we said that the permit should not begranted and that the individual should beencouraged to return to U.S.A.Frequent reports are coming in about GermanSubmarine bases on the west coaSt of Eire.(here seems little doubt that something of thekind is going on. We are passing reports onto the Ministry of Devence for their comments.N.I.D. are getting rather exasperated and arethinking of putting up a full-dress memo urgingthat steps with or ithout the cooperation ofEire should be taken to safeguard the Irishroast. Members of a submarine crew who wereptured the other day were in possession ofpackets of Irish cigarettes.1.0. sent us a copy of a letter they were send-ng the High Commissioner in S.Africa throughthe D.O. dealing with our naturalisat sation policyct seems that the S. of S. has reversed thedecision not to proceed with the naturalisationof enemy aliens in time of war.

Hewants to have the personnel vetted. Iexplained that vetting by this departmenwas useless and that S.B. would probably beunable to cope with the volume and thateven if they could the results would benormeans conclusive. It would be perfedtly possible for two Irishmen to comeover from Eire and do all the necessarydamage. At the same time it seemed futileto go on vetting all these people from theCommunist or Fascist point of view whichwe were doing at the rate of some 16,000a month, while there is no check on theI.R.A. who are by. far the most dangerousfrom a security point of view.Gravesend telephoned to say that a Dutchmancalled Grandes had arrived en route forHolland. He was searched and found to bein possession of a number of documentsreferring to aircraft etc. When questionedhe gave the name ofwho he saidwas in the British S.S.who worksfor S.I.S.. denied all knowledge.

There is no doubt nowthat previous calculations were thrown outon account of the balloon barrage. There,is another illicit wireless station beendetected somewhere near Winchester.P. and U.35 have worked out a scheme forindueing German airmen to desert. Theypropose that a message should be broadcastgiving details as to a landing ground onsome island which can be used by day ornight under certain condition They thinkthat quite a humber of pilots might desertand that in any case the broadcast willhave a demoralising efreot. In the meantimeP. has got himself arrested. He went tothe Nazi spy film, where he was recognisedby a Belgian who was a connection of Vans.The Belgian reported him to the police, whotook P. back to his home. Dick White hadto get the party straightened out.U.35 has worked out a useful plan for gettingDick' agent out to the Hague. Her comnec-tions are very good and she ought to com-pensate for the loss of P. to a certaindegree.This has been one of. the worst days sinceI have been in the office. One continuousstream of questions; telephoning and signingletters. The trouble is that matters ofTHIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSCatalogue Reference.KV/4/1853/9/04STupolicy all emanate from work in B.branch,but that there seems to be nobody in theoffice whose duty it is to formulate policyand get app oproval from higher authority.The questions are almost invariably thrownback at B. who have to d rive them out ofthe office, and try to do their investigatiowork at the same time. We have just got ourfirst batch of names from S.B. of those whoare to go before the tribunals, but noinstructions appear to have been issuedto provincial C.C.s. The vetting of thessnames is going to throw an increased burdenon our experts, since wherever there is atrace a summary of information to be put upwill have to be carefully vetted, otherwisewe shall get into difficulties. I am tryingto form a section for this work.SEPTEMBER 24thQuieter day owing to Sunday being regardedby other departments as a day of rest. Ithas not yet been fully realised that the wargoes on on Sundays as wel 1 as weekdays.Discussed with Craig information regardingsubmarine bases on West Coast of Ireland.The Admiralty are worried about this andare anxious to get up a case to presentto the D.O. Their view is that they shouldbe allowed to go inside the 3-mile limitin order to control German submarine activi-ties.D.N.I. does not want us to communicateinformation from Eire on this question pendisome decision. Personally I cannot quite sewhy. I warned Craig against vague allega.-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/ about which reach us andSsTprobably himself from Northern Ireland.At the same time T feel it is highlyprobable that the Germans are active onthe West Coast and that the Govt. of Eirethough possibly willing, are ill-equippedto deal with this matter.The soldiers are getting worried about thetroops in this country corresponding withfriends and relations in Eire and so dis-closing there position and movements.It has once more emphasised the necessityfor some form of censorship. So ar therehas been no decision on this question.M. has put up a note on the BUF and theNordic League. I have asked for somedirection as to policy. The BUF seem tobe getting into the War Reserve Police.It seems to me that the time has ometo consider whether we go for theseorganisations as a whole and have themsuppressed, r whether we continue todeal with the law-breakers as and whenwe find them. If we deal with theorganisations as a whole we shall have todo it largely on their prograxelanliterature.The question has been raised whetherenemy aliens interned should receivethe balance of their banking accounts.I have asked Holderness for a ruling.SEPTEMBER 25thDiscussed with Dick White, Sneath, M.and Hollis the question Of the BUF andthe Nordic League. My view is that weshould take stock of the position andmake some definite suggestions forcleaning up these organisations. It isCatalogue Reference:KV/4/185 KV/4/1855GI think worth considering whether in SO faras the BUF is concerned the Commissionershould not send for Mosley, confront him withceetain evidence from his press and fromleaflets and ask him definitely what is theattitude of his organisation in the presentcrisis. To us it seems that Mosley's futureis very much bound up with the success orfailure of Hitler, and his purpose would seemto be to impede the prosecution of war.Sneath is preparing a note. There seeminteresting developments as regards theNordic League which is evidently trying topenetrate the Pleace Pledge Union. Thismove can only be in the interests of Germany.We hopeshortly to have more concrete evidenceon this point.The question of permits is becomingincreasingly diificult. It is obviously inour interests to out down travel as muchas possible.Today we have had cases of members Of theItalian Fascio who for one reason or anotherwish to go to Italy. It may b. argued thatnot much harm will result since they cancollect all the information they canhere andhave it sent out through the diplomaticbag. On the other hand it is true to saythat much more can be acheived by personalcontact than by anything sent in in wri riting,and that from a security point of view anytraffic to Italy is undesirable. Allan hastaken this up with the D.M.L. and asked him tothrash the question out with the F.0. and letus have a ruling. I have spoken to Staffordand suggested to him that perhaps somethingcould be broadcast to the effect that permitswould only be granted when the jourey wasdefinitely in the national interest. HeCatalogue Reference: Reference:KV/4/185 :KV/4/185S?thought that this was possible but saidthat the great ifficulty was Eire. Thereis I gather to be a meeting on Fridayat which I presume we shall be represented.Cookie's pre-war spy Adams has been given7 years.A Britis sh subject called Hildesheim whohas lived in Germany practically all hislife returned here the other day and lefehis wife and child at Hamburg. In givingan count of himself he said that duringthe last war he had been employed in theconstruction of German submarines. He hadlately been employed on doing technicaltranslations for a firm in Hamburg.Cookie interviewed him and pointed out to 7him that his conduct during the last war hadrendered him liable to a charge of hightreason. Hildesheim turned the colourof parchment and said that he had neverthought of that. Cookie has taken hispassport and told him he will probablyhear further from him in due course.Hildesheim only got his British passportin 1938.Hordern,c.c.anes called about the caseof Kuchenmeister and left some papers.It seems that people are pressing for K'Sreturn, otherwise the wheels won't go round.T said I did not think we could possiblytake the responsibilit of having him atlarge here.Hordern was most anxious that we shouldlet him have copies of letters that wesend to Borough C.C.S in his area as hehas a special branch which he calls his.Branch and which deals almost exclusivelyCatalogue Referenee ecting this department.S6He was rather upset that he had never been putau fait with the activities of the AuslandsOrganisation and did not know about the caseof KuchenmeisterI told him that I would see what we coulddofto put things right.A Director's Meeting was held today. Therewas a general discussion on the questionof permits. It has been decided that weshall draft a letter to the H.0. embodying outomplaints and send a copy to Lord Hankey ,asking that some direetion should be receivedfrom higher quarters.A note to all C.C.s went out from the H.O.on the l6th Sept. telling them to keep aspecial watch on enemy aliens observed tofrequent the vicinity of places where H.M.forces were embarking or engaged in otherwar activities. Should C.C.S have reason tosuspect that they were taking an undueinterest in naval military or air forceactivities theywere to be interned pendingthe hearing of their cases by the tribunals.From a conversation between Halifax and thePolish mbassador it appears that therewas a secret protocol in the Anglo-PolishTreaty which made it definite that the treatywas directed against aggression by Germany.We were therefore free to act in regard toRussia in any way which we considered wouldbe most likely to the coron end of defeatingGermany.kOn the l0th Sept. the Hungarian Minister forForeign Affiars informed the Polish Ministerin Buda Pest that on Sept.9th Ribbentrop haddemanded the passage of Germar troops throughCatalogue Reference: :KV/4/18559Kassa. The Regent had refused and takendefence measures. He had then informedMussolini who only a few days previouslyhad told the Hungarians that Germany hadno intention of violating Hungary'neutrality. Mussolini was much takenaback and undertook to defend the neutralityof Hungary though by what means was notstated.An S.I.S. report states that Italy hassent 5-700 aeroplanes to Germany and 100to Hungary.SEPTEMBER 26thA Comunist named GOODMAN who was associatedwith Claud COCKBURN, applied for a permitto go to Paris on behalf of the Daily Mirrorand The Week. His application was backedb y Lord Faringdon and others. We turned itdown on the grounds that if the French askedus to accept one of their Communists weshould have refused him leave to land.The Air Ministry have agreed to accept anumber of POlish pilots for training here.There is also a move to saddle us with avast colony of Polish refugees and to allowPolish mechanics to be employ ed in ouraeroplane industry. There is to be ameeting tomorrow on the subject at 3 p.m.I have no objection to the pilots but feelthat we should do everythingni our powerto hold back another avalanche of refugees.Any of those ofmilitary age might well beabsorbed by France who according to Capt.Daruis reforming the remnants of the Polish Army.I have given instructions for all suspeetItalians to be placed on the Balck List.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1856OInterned enemy aliens are now appealingto the special tribunals set up underSir Walter Monkton. I have said that Wemust have prior notice of such appealsand that if it is proposed to release thealien we must be represented at a subseo senhearing. I feel however that there is namuch point in reviewing a number of thesecases until we have had time to vet thedocuments seized and to make up our minewhether we ourselves are prepared torecommend (a) release under restrictionsor (b) repatriation. The latter does noseem to have been for consi deration in Uinstructions given by the H.O. to thetribunals.King, the F.. cypher clerk, has beenarrested. He had a safe-deposit for aconsiderable sum of money in 25 notes.This has been seized and the notes wilbe traced. Both he and his nistress denthe allegations. They are both underarrest pending enquiries.S.I.S. have one or two tentative reportsabout an agreement between Russia andTurkey re the closing of the DardanellesThe permit situation is getting worseand worse. I have drafted an urgent notto D.S.S. asking for some dir ection andfor some definition of policy regardingEire.Total arrests to date, Germans 231, British14, duals 6.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1856(SEPTEMBER 27 thThe case of King is developing in aninteresting way. The notes in hissafe deposit have been traced to Pieck,a Dutchman and Soviet agent, and alsoto the Moscow Narodny Bank. Another manin the code section of the F.O. is alsoinvolved. His name is Major Grange. Hehas been suspended pending interrogation.Another individual named Oake is beinginterrogated. It seems doubtful that heis very closely involved.On the 26th D.S.S. sent a strong noteto Maxwell urging. that more consideratiorshould be given to the security side ofthe alien problem and recommending thatthese matters should come more into thehands of the Fighting Services. who shouldhave the last word regarding admission orexclusion. Failing some such rrangementthe security service could not be respon-sible for safeguarding the nationalinterest. The Fighting Services havereceived a copy of this letter and havebeen asked for their comments.At 3 p.m. I attended meeting at the H.O. todiscuss the question of the Polish refugees.In reply to a wire from the BritishAmbassador to Poland the F.O. had alreadysaid that members of the Polish Govt. couldbe granted visas. This had been done with-out reference to Passport Control or our-selves. I said that provided there couldbe some guarantee that these people werebona fide officials of the Polish Govt.there would be no objection to their beinggranted visas in transit to France whereCatalogue Reference:KV/4/185 KV/4/18562it is intended to re-form the Covt. TheF.0. were also anxious to grant visas to Poltish Consular officers and staffs in variouscountries in Europe, but there seemed to tone bea danger of all sorts of people attachingthemselves to the Consulates for the pur-pose of getting into this country or toFrance. I suggested that only such membersof consulates as had been reported to theF.O. of the Govt. of the country inwhich they resided, should be giventransit visas. The question of Poles ofmilitary age was then considered. It wasagreed that as the French were forming aPolish legion these people should go toFrance. There would be no objection totheir passing through this country in transitprovided they had French visas and that theFrench would not refuse them right of entry.As regards Air Force personnel, the AirMinistry were proposing to form a unit whichwould be under R.A.F. diseipline; this wouldinclude mechanics and ground staff. Therewas no question of any of the mechanics beingintroduced into our aircraft industry. Thepossibility of a naval unit was also underconsideration, but if these people came theywould also be under naval discipline.Lastly it was agreed that cases of ordinaryrefugees could not be considered. TheF.O. wished to say that special cases mightbe dealt with. It was requested however thatno instructions on this point should beissued to P.C.0.S since it would only leadto a flood of applications. If there werespecial cases, e.g.mothers-in-law of Ambassa-dors, applications would be made in any caseand could be dealt with as they atrose.Catalogue Reference: :KV/4/185SshouldA difficult permit question is,/a Czechengaged in the leather trade and represent-ing a Czech firm, be allowed to go to Jugo-Slavia in order to carry on his businessfrom there. Technically he would be tradingwith the enemy. The probability is that hewill go back to Czechoslovakia. He is infact an enemy alien, although we cannot soregard him. If he is allowed to remainhere he will be without means.We also have a Pole who wants to go backto Poland, to his factory,via Seandinavia.Although technically an ally he is in f actan enemy alien. Both these cases have beenheld up.D.M.I. in answer to our gnery about permitsfor Italians urges that they should betreated as leniently as possible as we arecoming to terms with them over the supplyof raw materials with which they wil.lmanufacture armaments for this country.This seemed rather doubtful policy inview of an S.I.S. report which shows thatthe Italians have supplied the Germans with5-700 aeroplanes.SEPTEMBER 28thWe have a difficult case of a Swiss calledIta who owns'a hat factory in Aylsbury andanother in Zurich and Vienna. He is suspecton a count of German associations. Shouldhe be allowed to go to Zurich? We havedecided to interrogate him thoroughly andreserve our decision in the meantime. Acurious point in his case i that heemployed Buckeridge &c Braune, the GermanEmbassy solicitors, when applying to theH.O. to be allowed to stablish his businesshere.Catalogue Reference:h KV/4/185G uI have asked Pilcher whether it would be inorder for us to interrogate Braune under80a and ask him whether he took up thiscase at the request of the German Embassy.It has occurred to me that we might alsousefully ask Braune to try and recollectwhether he had any other curious clientssent to him by the Embassy. He must knowof a lot and if inclined could be ofconsiderable help. Cookie is going to seehim armed with a warrant under 80a.Matthews tells me that they have a 100appeals from internees which will becoming along to us. It will be for theHome Secretary to say whether these peopleare to be allowed to appeal or not , and hewill want to have the facts of each easebefore him. I told Matthews that I did notknow how we were going to tackle this at themoment and we were much more concerned gett-ing people in than letting them out. Wouldit be possible to defer these cases for amonth. He rather doubted it. I am takingthis up with D.S.S.Matthews left me his instructions to C.C.Sabout the tribunals. I pointed out to himthat there was no provision by which thepeople going before the provincialtribunals were to be passed over our records.He took the line that this was unnecessaryand would hold up proceedings. I said thatthe internment or release of enemy alienswas primarily the concern of the securityservice and to ignore the security recordsin dealing with their case struck me asbeing the height of irsanityx He saidthat the matter had been discussed betweenMaxwell and Sir Ernest Holderness and thatwe had agreed to our records being ignored.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1856STI spoke to D.D.S. who as far as I can makeout never agreed to anything of the kindalthough it seemed to me that the pointhad been missed The procedure wes isparticularly illogical in view of the factthat we are vetting all of the cases forthe Met.Police. I finally arranged thatin a ccordance with the existing instructionswhereby the chairman of the tribunals whenin doubt about a case can draw the H.0.file, H.O. should see that our informationwas also tapped. As the tribunals havealready started work this seems to be theonly thing we can do.Our recorendations to the chairman on theinterrogations have not yet been sent out,in spite of the fact that cases are alreadybeing dealt with. We only had the draftfor vetting yesterday.Between 7 and 8 p.m. Philip Allen,Secretaryto the Home Secretary, rang up about twoalleged Dutch inventors, de Voogt and J.R.Carp. Had we any objection to theircoming here? It appears that AdmiralTowers on the recommendation of an M.P.called Sir Reginald Clerry( had saidthat he vouldlike to see these people.Towers had made no reference to ourselvesor N.I.D. It transpired that Carp hasbeen engaged in some very unsavourygun-running activities over a period ofyears. After speaking with N.I.D. I wasrung up by the First Lord's secretary. Iexplained to him that Carp was undesirableand that our general experience of thesematters was that so-calledyinventorsreally came to find out the extent of ourprogress in any particular line, and thatthese people might well be acting inGerman interests, particularly as CarpCatalogue ReferenCe:KV/4/1856Cseemed to be the kind of person who woulddo anything for money. If however theAdmiralty were prepared to say that thevisits of these people was a matter of nat-ional importance we would be prepared tolet them come provided that they were given48 hours visa and we were told the time andport of arrival.SEPTEMBER 29thH.0. and F.0. are pressing us to state ourpolicy with regard to repatriation or exchangeof German prisoners for people interned inGermany. We have replied that we thinkthat in the first instance we should preferto return aliens who have been vetted bythe tribunals and concerning whom a decisionhas been arrived at that they should beallowed to r emain at large under restrictionsOur stronger cards in the shape of membersof the NSDAP should be held for bargainingfor the more important people. This matterraised the question of instructions totribunals that they should ask enemy alienswhether they are prepared to return toGermany, and that even in cases of AryanGermans who were desirous to stay: here,there seemed no reason why they shouldnot be served with a deportation order provid-ed they were not likely to be subject topersecution on racial or political grounds.D.D.S. is taking this matter up.D.S.S. saw Maxwell and put before himanumber of our grievances. We have not yetheard whether they will be satisfied.C. r rang up about Dr.Yelitch,Croat terrorist,who has previously been reported to be inCatalogue Reference:KV/4/185G7the pay Of the Nazis, and is arranging forthe ssassination of the Prince Regent ofYugoslavia. He is arriving at Gib. on anItalian boat on Sunday. Travelling under afalse name on a Hungarian passport. Can hebe turned back? It seems that we have thepowers provided the F.O. will stand the racketwith the Italians and Hungarians. The matteris under discussion between F.O. and D.N.I.SEPTEMBER 30thS. of S. has instructed C.C.S that beforeinterning under Royal Prerogative they are tosubmit the case to H.O. unless the matter isvery urgent. We are arranging that in anycase of this sort C.C.S should let us have acopy of their letter to H.O. since it seemsthat certain cases have already been reportedto H.0. who have turned down the question ofinternment without reference to ourselves.Spoke Nicholls F.0. who informed me that ithad been decided to bring in the Conte deSavoia at Cib. on grounds of searching forcontraband, and that r.YELITCH would beaken off and interned. It was intended tonform the Italians either at the moment whenaction was taken or immediately afterwards.We have heard indirectly that the Cabinethave decided that refugees other than enemyaliens are to be allowed to come here fromneutral countries. I suppose these willinclude a large number of Poles.Sneath has prepared a memo on the Fascists wiwhich is being submitted to the H.0. and tothe Commissioner for their instructionsCatalogue Reference: :KV/4/18566regarding action.We have obtained a card index of the NSDAPup till 1934. The up to date index wasprobably transferred to the Embassy but theearlier index was left in cabinets whichwere sold to a furniture dealer. The latterhanded them over to the Police. A goodmany of the people we had not formerlydetected have left. There are some15 or 20 still in this country, whoseinternment is being ordered.There have been a flood of applicationsby firms for the return of KUCHENMEISTERwhom they all say would be of great benefitto our rearmament industry. We are re-stating the case to the H.O. and recommend-ing that if he returns he should be internedforthwith.Maude has seen Walter Monkton who is incharge of the appeal tribunals. Monkton isvery much of our way of thinking.

WhenHitler's portrait was flashed on the screenthere was complete silence. Goebbels he saidwas still working in the background but wasnot much in evidence owing to his formerfulminations against Russia.The Daily Worker has made another volteface in its editorial of 30th Sept.The war is now an imperialist one and notanti-Fascist.

It would seem to bea case of he who pays the piper calls thetune.I gather from the censorship that telegramsfrom Eire to Germany are not Ito be held up infuture. The exact reason is not clear.According to S.I.S. there was a great dealof German propaganda going on in France onthe lines that the French are being made topull the chestnuts out of the fire for Gt.Britain. I gather that some of this propa-ganda is not al together ineffective and thatthe French are anxious about the FlandinGroup.OCTOBER 2ndGerald Thesiger, who is chairman of one ofthe tribunals, approached Kenneth Youngerfor guidance. So far he has received no listof questions to be put to aliens (which wecompiled and sent to H.0. for distribution tochairmen) am he can get very little localinformation about any of those who are tocome before him except trivial matters such asCatalogue ReferenCe:KV/4/18571having no back light on their bicyeles.He was completely at sea as to whether heshould intern an aryan German against whomthere was no adverse record. Kenneth has donehis best to instruet him.We have had a case of a German director whohas been denounced by his fellow Britishdirector for impeding A.R.P. precautions atthe factory and by refusing to resign, pre-venting the firm from being employed onCovt. work. We are asked whether this manshould or should not be interned. In my viewhe should certainly go in, but presumably thisaction would be contrary to H.o.policy. We areputting the matter up as a test case to theH.O.The S.C.0. Portsmouth came up specially toinform us that the local C C. had submittedseveral cases to the H.O. for internment underRoyal Prerogative and that these cases hadbeen turned down, presumably wi thout anyreference to ourselves.

He asks whether we have any objectionto these people being taken off and transferredto Folkestone in transit to the continent.D.4 are dealing with this matter.A Director's Meeting was held at 5 p.m. today.Discussion was more or less on the same linesas at the previous meeting. It was pointedout that we still had no policy with regardto permits. Even ithin the office thereseemed to be conflicting opinions. I saidCatalogue Reference:KV/4/185 :KV/4/18572that as far as the office was concerned therecould only be one view, namely that onsecurity grounds it was desirable to restricttravel to a minimum. There were howeverother considerations which affeet the F.0.and W.0., and that it was for some higherauthority in the War Cabinet to lay down aline of policy. D.S.S. said that he haddecided to appoint someone to act as liaisonbetween this department and H.0. and whowould represent our point of view regardinthese matters. Personally I rather doubtwhether this will meet the particular issue.The ribunals were also iscussed. I pointedout the confusion which seemed to exist inthe minds of chairmen as to how they Nereplaced, and that in the absence of someguidance over and above the list of que stionswhich they were to put to enemy aliens, itwas likely that some of them would put every-body in and others would let everybody out.The matter of Eire was again discussed andit was pointed out how impossible it was todeal with this question piecemeal. It neededsome indication of policy from above.C.C.Grimsby informs us that a German namedENGERT wishes to be interned for his ownsafety. I have asked H.O. to let us have aruling.

He told us thathe had refused a permit to Winston's son whowanted to spend 3 days of his honeymoon inParis. Permit was refused owing to insufficie:grounds for travel. One imagines there willbe a backwash.Maxwell,at the request of the F.O. has pre.pared a memo rBhowing action taken regard-ing enemy aliens and a ction proposed in thefuture. He seemed to imply that in the caseof aryan Germans they would be exempted frominternment unless there were specificinformation orrstrong suspicion that mhe: waseengaged in espionage. I drafted a replypointing out that this was not at all our view.In the case of an Aryan German who, if hereturned to Germany, would not be subject topersecution on racial or political grounds,there was no reason why thisman should notcither be deported in exchange for a Britishsubject or interned for the duration of thewar. D.S.S. took the reply to Maxwell whoadmitted that he had rather missed this point.Philip Jordan has applied f or a permit to go aswar correspondent to Paris for the News Chroricle. We turned him down for the Ministryof Information and the V.0. have for somereason or other asssumed that we have refusedhim a perrit. In the meantime Horeb isfuming and says that in the absence of veryspecial grounds the permit must be grantewithin half an hour. We do not propose torefuse him one as it would obviously beimpossible seeing that Jordan is foreigneditor.

Before discussing the matterhe wanted to have information as to who thesepeople were and under what powers they wereacting.

The matter appears ears to havebeen overlooked in our Derence Regulations.D.P.P. says that procedure by trial for hightreason would be far too cumbersome and in anumber of cases ineffective. For instance ifa Geman arrived at one of our ports and wasarrested before he had time to do anything,there would be no very good grounds in theabsence of special information regarding hismission for preferring a charge of high treason.He could moreover say that he owed no allegiancethe King and therefore could not commitact of high treason. It was agreed by allthe hish legal pundits who discussed thismatter that it could not be left to the judgeto decide whether a spy should be shot or sentLO penal servitude for life. A law shouldbe Iramed SO that if the man was convicted ofespionage the Judge had no alternative but tosentence him to death an the same lines thathe would sentence 8 murderer.

According to S.B. reportsthis man was a communist and acting inComintern interests. Kendal does not thinkhe can put this man up before the tri-binal as he would probably make a speechto the chairman saying that they both hadthe same object in view, namely the destruc-tion of the Nazis. Kendal seems to thinkthat we ought to put him in under RoyalPrerogative or 18b, but this involves amatter of policy with which our attitudetowards the C.P. is rather bound up.The B.B.C. want to broadcast certain arrange-ments made by the International EsperantistSociety for communication between theirmembers in belligerent countries.

He was interned at the outbreakof war and subsequently certain specificallegations were satisfactorily explained.We told this to the H.O. who now propose tolet him out. I explained to D.S.S. thatthere were two sides to this man's case,firstly the specific allegations and secondlythe fact that he was a German and hadintimate Reichswehr connections. Oneaspect of the case had been cleared, buthe could not possibly be cleared of the otherHe should therefore remain interned.D.S.S. put this view to Maxwell and toldhim that if the man was liberated it wouldbe entirely on the responsibility of theS. of S.This is the type of case on which the H.O.and most of the chairmen of the tribunalsseem hopelessly confused. I have suggestedthat Turner should go round and see allthe chairmen privately and xplain to themour point of view. This might tend towardssome measure of uniformity. I asked Pil-cher whether he thought this sag Qetion wasgrossly improper. He said undoubtedly inpeace time it would be, but in the presentcircumstances he did not think there wasany real objection. He himself would dealwith the Appeal Tribunal.The British Centre against Imperialism andthe International African Service Bureauhave issued literature which constitutesan offence under DR.39b. Both theseorganisations are more or less under theI.L.P. and have their headquarters in thesame building. This raises a very delicatematter.

When warbroke out he applied to the German Consulat Dublin who told him to return to Germanyvia England. He and his wife were takenoff at Liverpool and interned. The childrenwere sent to a home. The Swiss Minister hasnow intervened. Cooper wants the wife andchildren to go back to Erith where they aredomiciled. I said the husband would have tobe interned as a technician, and that thewife and children could go straight back toCatalogue Reference: :KV/4/185Germany, possibly in exchange for some Britishsubject. We do not however desire them to beleft at large at Erith.OCTOBER 9thDiscussed with B.4b. the question of theCzech Commmunist group here. It seems that wemight usefully take the opportunity of send-ing these people to the French. As agroup they are apparently anxious to fightthe Nazis, although they may engage in sub-versive activities once they have enlisted.Since however the French have given all Czechsin France the alternative of joining theLegion or an internment camp the probabilityis that they will know how to deal with them.According to an F.0. despatch the BelgianAmbassador in Berlin and the Belgian Consulin Cologne both agree that our leaflets arehaving the reverse effect.

Their programme is to arrest all theprincipal leaders of the Party on the groundsthat they have sold their country, andlaidup large balances for themselves abroad.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1852itler is to be the only exception and will bellowed to remain as a puppet head. Thermy could not attack him on account of theirath of allegiance, but they would see to ithat he was rendered entirely innocuous. Twonvoys are said to have come to Holland onhis mission and were anxious to see a Britishabinet Minister in order to get somessurance that if they took over and proposedhe restoration of Poland and Czechoslovakia,ermany would be given an honourable settle-ent. They were told that it was impossible foor a British Cabinet Minister to be involvedn a matter of this sort but that if a noticehich they had prepared found its way intohe "Basler Nachrichten" before Thursday,hey could go ahead. The message in theaper is that it is reported that there ismovement by certain elements in the Germanrmy to arrest all Party leaders on therounds that they have betrayed the State etc.1.35 in order to get this message througho the B.N.,approached a contact of his inhe Swiss Legation. This was necessary inrder to get the use of the Press telephoneine. The Swiss Legation must have had somedea of what is intended but they put U.35n touch with the representative here of the.N., which is generally speaking anti-Nasiin tone. This representative thought thestory was a good one and worth publication,ind a message was telephoned through lastight. When it appears it will be broadcast2 or 3 times as a news item by the B.B.C. andthis is supposed to give the signal forgeneral revolt. It all sounds ratherPhillips Oppenheim but there may perhaps besomething in it. In the meantime H.M.G.,ininformed, are entirely di sconnected withthe projeet.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/18568Sir John Anderson has, without reference toourselves, has written to Lord Lloyd agreeingto the admission to this country of 100 alienstudents from all over the world. This is adeparture from the decision reached that onlyin very exceptional cases should visas begranted to students, tourists or theatricaltroupes. We only heard of this matter throughthe courtesy of passport control. We werenever even asked to vet these people and evenif we had been it was doubtful if the machicould stand it. The vetting is alreadynearly a fortnight behind. The trouble isthat if we do not lay down hard and fast rulesabout permits and visas which eliminatecertain categories and only depart from themin very special circumstances, the wholemachine here both as regards the Registry andsection officers is clogged. Endless timeis being expended on investigating each caseon its merits and we are prevented from gettingdown to cases that really matter. It is theold grievance that the more you increase thesurface of leakage by the admission of aliensof one kind or another the more difficult itis to detect cases of espionage. In fact thewhole problem becomes unmanageable. I amgoing to try and draft some letter to Maxwellon this subject.The Army are proposing to admit quite anumber of aliens and enemy aliens after theyhave passed the tribunals. They seem to thinkthat if a man has passed the tribunal he isharmless. M.I.1 have however entered acaveat and suggested that these people wouldnot be acceptable unless they had previouslybeen approved by M.I.5. I pointed out thatthe tribunals investigation is quite valuelessand that it will in the present circumstancesbe quite impossible for M.I.5 to guaranteethe fona fides of any enemy alien. If it isCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18589decided to admit these people who in the endwill probably be more trouble than they areworth it must be arranged that they areemployed in positions where they cannotpossibly do any harm, and this in itself isa very difficult point to ensure.OCTOBER 12thCecil returned from his journey to Belgium.ne Kin: refused to see him, but I gatherthat he is sending some communication indicating that Stein is persona grata. The King':position is a very dolicate one, since ifeither his ministers or the people thoughtthat he had in any way jeopardised theneutrality of Belgiumn, he might be forced toabdicate. Feeling in Belgium on the mainte-nance of neutrality appears to be very stroneand there will only be a change if someviolation takes place by Geriany.

We therefore had him interned.There followed endless protests and Maxwellthought that as the Chairman of the tribunalhad said that he was a fit sub ject fornaturalisation he should be released forth-with. We have said that we cannot acceptthis view and that the case must take itscourse and come before the Appeal Tribunal.H.O. have suggested that the permit systemfor Eire should be abolished on the groundsthat it was primarily for the purpose ofpreventing those of military age from leav-ing the country. They argued that sincemilitary age has never been defined and theH.O.have declared that British subjects arefree to come and go until they are called upthe system has served its purpose. No accountappeared to have been taken of the Securityaspect. Pilcher has drawn up a memo on thewhole question showing that the granting orwitholding of permit to Eire is only partof a problem which is causing us graveconcern. We have said that rigid censorshipshould be imposed and that the permit systemshould be continued on the basis that nofacilities are granted unless the journeyis in the national interest. A copy of thismemo is going to Lord Hankey.Eire neutrality is rapidly becoming a farce.A German submarine sailed into Dingle Baywith the crew of a cargo steamer which hadbeen torpedoed, and two British a eroplaneslanded in Kilmarnock, but after the necessaryrepairs had been made were allowed to proceedA representative of the Civic Guard, who wasCatalogue subsequently ReferenCe:KV/2 ended with the92following remark "And who in the name of Godare we supposed to be neutral against any-way?"The Marston Press, who print the DailyW rker, are also engaged in printing petrolcoupons for the Govt. Communists think thisis a very good arrangement and are doubtlessmaking the most of it.OCTOBER 13thI spent a considerable time in trying to getall sections to say what categories in so faras travel is concerned could be dealt withby rule of thumb instead of reference to thisoffice. I also get B.Sections working onthe categories of H.O.files which which areunnecessarily sent to us for observations.I then proposed to end off a letter toMaxwell explaining our difficulties in thisrespect and requesting that something shouldbe done to establish general principleswhich will cut down the work of this officeand prevent endless cases being sent overhere to be treated on their merits.D.S.S. showed Van Maxwell's letter in whichit was stated that H.O. did not proposeto intern Germans qua Germans but onlyif we had some specific information againstthem. Van there and then dictated a verystrong note to Halifax on the question,saying that unless some change in this policywere effected things might go seriouslywrong.Princess Hohenlohe and her mother haveapplied for exit permits to proceed to theU.S.A. The ostensible grounds are thather son is seriously ill. Actually she isCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18513probably going either to see Hans WIEDEMANNHitlerts envoy in San Francisco, whose mis-tress she has been, or else to consult anAmerican crook lawyer in connection with hercase against Rothermere. There is also thepossibility that Rothermere may be paying herto leave the country. She had been paid about25,000 a year by Rothermere to work on appeasement. She is now suing Rothermere for breachof contract and in consequence his solicitorstre trying to persuade the H.O. that thePrincess is a dangerous Nazi agent and shouldbe deported. Rothermere is consideringwhether he will not go to theAttorney Generaland ask him to give his fiat that the caseshould be stopped in the national interest.Personally I think that it would be in thenational interest that the case should beheard.A man called Revesez, a Hungarian describinghimself as a cO-ordinator of information,applied for a permit to leave this country.He was backed by Winston Churchill. Ia turn-ing up our records we found that the semeBureau regard him as a Nazi agent in theguise of a Left Wing refugee. D.S.S. toldthe First Lord who said that he had the utmostconfidence in this man who had been hispublishing agent for many years and thathe was proposing to put him into the Ministryof Information He thought the 2eme Bureauhad libelled him but would like us to makefurther enquiries. We are doing this, and inthe meantime are allowing the man to travelwithout being searchedRepresentations are being made by M.P.s andothers about Hanfstaengel. Stephens hasinterviewed him. Our conclusions are thatsince he has remained a Party member and thatCatalogue Reference:KV/4/185Page 94 of KV4/185 does notexist The back ofpage 93 isnumbered 95.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1895.his son is a member of the Hitler Jugend, andsince he has been indirectly in touch withHitler regarding his return to Germany rightup to the middle of August he was not a properperson to be at large. He had never publishedany a rticles against the Nazi regime in spiteof long-drawn-out negotiations and in oneinstance he had refused to give evidence ina claim against the German Government datingback to the last war and had placed allthe information at the disposal of theGerman Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs.Bethmann-Hollweg is another case in whichrepresentations are being made, This manpassed the tribunal but was subsequentlyarrested on account of his name being foundin the card index of the NSDAP at ClevelandTerrace. The H.O. took the view that heought to be released at once because thechair-man of the tribunal had suggested that he wasa fit subject for nationalisation. We havepointed out that in our view it did not followthat because a man had been a member of theParty and subsequently found himself out ofsympathy he was necessarily a fit person to.beat large. We therefore thought that the manshould take his turn before the appealtribunal.Wenhave had our first case under the Tradingwith the Enemy Act. An Indian named SETHIA wasgoing out to Italy in order to complete certaintransactions for the sale of goods to Germany.I do not think thecase is a very hot one.Jane has been down to see Percy GLADING atMaidstone. "Miss X" had tokd us some time agothat Glading was very worried because Petersthe Soviet agent had placed him in charge ofcertain people who were giving informatioCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18576purely for money and not for party reasons.lading did not like these people as he thoughtthey might compromise the whole Party.When interviewed Glading was rather stuffy atfirst but gradually, under a good deal offlattery, his own conceit got the better ofhim. The conversation developed on profession-al lines and in the end Glading even softenedtowards "Miss X", when he realised thathe had placed her in a very difficultposition. His real grievance was againstS.B. in producing the porter at Fawcett Courtwho swore that Glading had visited Brandes'flat. This he said was a lie. Otherwise heregarded the whole business as a fair cop.He did not say anything very useful exceptthat as regards the other people who hadbeen working for Peters they were not veryfar from Whitehall. The inference was thatif he knew that he probably knew a great dealmore. Jane is going to visit him again short-ly.OCTOBER 14thNothing very much occurred beyond an excellentlunch with the French.

This matterwas submitted to the Legal Section who repliedin the following terms:"It is abundantly true that for the purposesof the Trading with the Enemy Act a personshall be deemed to have traded with the enemy:if he (and by the blessed interpretationtA Act1889 words importing the masculine gendershall include females) has had any commercial,financial or other intercourse with, or forthe benefit of, an ememy'. It may be assumed,T fancy, that Miss Dalrymple is intending tohave intercourse with an enemy. That in allCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18598conseience should be enough. We need notdelve into the difficult problem as to whetherit would be for the benefit of the particularenemy, who may indeed be pathetically unfit,that Miss Dalrymple should have intercoursewith him.

This isapparently the reason why the British Govt.have not turned down the German proposalsat once and have said that they will becarefully examined.German propaganda in Spain is on the linesthat Russia and Germany are defending theinterests of the workers against westerncapitalism. This only goes to show how nearin some ways to one another Bolshevism andFascism are!Special material shows that there is a certaindivergence of opinion between ourselves andthe French over the Turkish Treaty and thenegotiations going on in Moscow. It is notquite clear what these conditions are butprobably they affect the Dardenelles, and thequestion of Turkish neutrality unless Italyjoins the war.An interesting example of the muddhed stateof international relations is the fact thatthe Soviet are still recognising the CzechMinister in Moscow.Heard of the sinking of the Royal Oak.OCTOBER l6thCookie has arrested an Austrian named KAFKAwho was to be a Nazi spy in the Austrian Leg-Kafka ion which is being is being held formed temporarily for active for travelling service.C.C. without It the seems necessary that he permit had been from attempting the local toget a list of the legionaries!

He seems quitsatisfied on the whole of the labour situationbut is a little afraid of trouble if foodprices rise and wages are kept low. BothCovt. and T.U. leaders are anxious to avoidCatalogue Reference:KVI4/185102an abnormal rise in wages as it will only leadto a great deal of trouble and dislocationafter the war when they have to come down.There is therefore a danger of agitation onthe lines that the I.U.leaders are in leaguewith the Covt. in opposing measures which wouldbe of benefit to the workers. Leggett'spolicy is as usual to sit heavily on allunofficial strikes and keep all disputeswithin the Unions. At the same time he isanxious to know of any genuine grievancesad to get them removed at the earliest possiblemoment. Recent troubles have been caused al-most entirely by mismanagement of Covt.Contraetbranches who are, he says, without exceptionthe worst employers of labour.Leggett was interesting about the P.M.

The particular paper in question isthe Sunday Graphic, with Kemsley and House,who both have German connections. Theparticular article had a good deal aboutmaking use of spies when we got them andforcing them to continue their communicationwith the enemy. If we cut out these particu-lar passages we indicate to the press thatthey have hit the nail on the head. In anegative way therefore they could quite easilybuild up a fair picture of our activities.The only course therefore is to ban all sucharticles entirely. This I gather is beingdone.As regards cases in which we are interested,it is suggested that no reference should bemade in the press until t has been decidedwhether they are to be held in camera or not.Shepherd is going to establish a liaison inthese matters with the Ministry of InformationThe Attorney General refuses to give his fiatto the case of Hewitt,the BUF organiser atBristol who has been distributing leafletswhich were an obvious infringement of D.R.I gather that this course was taken as amatter of Cabinet policy.

Maiski does not appearto know very much of what is going on inMoscow. He has been seeking an interviewwith Lloyd George presumably on the questionof the peace line which the latter hasadopted.It seems that according to the Treaty of1929 with Russia the latter cannot enterinto arrangements with Italy or Bulgariawithout Turkey's consent. If she did theRusso-Turkish pact would be at an end.The Turks have been emphasising this pointwhen making requests to us to give them amore or less free hand to deal with theRussians.

F.O. haveinformed neutral countries, but think thatletters cannot be regarded as contraband andshould go on after examination In practiceobjectionable letters are being stopped.A question has arisen as to whether weshould pass on such letters to the Americansif we consider they are of interest to theU.SA. It seems that the Censorship havebeen in the habit of sending some of themdirect. This is obviously undesirable, firstbecause it duplicates the chamnel and second-ly because the censorship are not in aposition to comment on the contents of theletters or the people writing them.

He could findnobody for an hour and a half except thecharwomen.He has been having a battle about passes forall civilians. Anybody who wishes will beable, on application to the police, and after establishing his bona fides, and byfilling in a somewhat complicated form, toobtain a pass which will establish hisidentity as a British subject. These passeswill be necessary for those wishing to enterthe protected area which has now beendeclared north of the Caledonian Canal. Thewhole of the north of Scotland will be ropedoff by guards. Nobody will be allowed toenter wi thout proper authority and a satis-factory explanation of his business. Pro-Calaldgue Reference:KW4/185eV civilian permits112will be a sine qua non. Metropolitan Policehave refused to undertake the work involvedand arrangements have been made for it to beundertaken by the Military Permit Office.There will be a space on the permit indica-ting when an individual is a dual national,and subjects of Eire will be told thatthey can proceed to the frontier at theirown risk, but will have to satisfy the localcontrol as to their business.The above system has become a matter ofurgency owing to the attacks on the Fleet.It seems that it was already laid down inthe Admiralty War Book that the whole areanorth of the Caledonian Canal should bedeclared a protected area but that thequestion had been overlooked. A permit toenter the area north of the Caledonian Canalwill not authorise the holder to proceedei ither to the Orkneys or the Shetlands, forwhich an a ditional permit will be required.As an example of a square peg in a round hole,the Oxford Don recounts that one of hiscolleagues, an eminent professor of MediaevalHistory, has been offered the position ofController of Lard in the Ministry of Food.The Cabinet discussed the question of actionagainst the B.U.F.,C.P. and P.P.U. inconnection with Stop the War leaflets, andPacifist propaganda, on the 16th. The HomeSecretary felt that a distinction should bemade between definitely defeatist and obstruc-tive propaganda directed against the Govt.war policy and towards a policy of appeasementThe Cabinet did not think that leaflets whichhad been issued up to the present were like-ly to do very much harm 2 and were inclinedto defer action until they had got a reallygood case. They felt however that if actionCatalogue Reference:KV74/185(5was taken it should be against the B.U.F.,C.P. and P.P.U. This sounds very unimagina-tive since many of those associated withthe P.P.U. are doubtless unaware of the factthat it has been penetrated by the NordicLeague and the B.U.F. for purposes which aredefinitely in the interests of G rmany. Ifthey are prosecuted they will become martyrsin the cause of peace. We have suggestedto the H.O. that by far the most effectiveway of dealing with the P.P.U. would beby question and answer in the House and bysubsequent publicity in the Press. Thismight well have the effect not only of dis-integrating the P.P.U. but also the B.U.F.and the Nordic League.Hankey has replied to our memo. about acensorship in Eire.

The French want to knowwhat significance attaches to the fact thatan individual has been granted a permitWe have been bound to say that a permitconstitutes no guarantee of the bona fidesof an individual, because all applicationsare not being referred to this office.Adams suggested that France should come underthe Military Permit Office. This would ensurethat all applications were referred and vetted.There might of course be cases where informa-tion in our records would not constitutesufficiently strong grounds for refusal of apermit. In such a case the French wouldprobably like to know what information wehad about the individual in question. Whilethis of course will involve us in extra workthe question of reciprocity on the other sideas between the 2eme Bureau and Passport Con-trol would have to be considered. We shallalso have to make arrangements with S.I.S.since at present such informatio as we haveabout aliens or British subjects is passed tothe 2eme Bureau by S.I.S. and their represen-ctataibyueinelesnee:KV/4/18531At 2 pom. Allen received a request fromthe War Office that somebody should go andsee C.I.G.S. and the Secretary of State onthe question of Eire Censorship.I went to the War Office at 2.45. Aftera few minutes with the C.I.G.S. who wasmainly interested in the creation of aprotected area on the Clyae, we both wentin to see S. of S.I was cross-examined for half-an-hour.S. of S. explained that Mr. Winston Churchillhad complained that within 24 hours of thediscussion in the Cabinet thatotheFleet wasovunewutansMened from Scapa to the Clyde,the fact had become known to the GermanAuthorities and that they were even broad-casting information which they must be gettingout of the country by rapid means. S. of S.wanted to know how such leakage could occur.I said that I had no definite confirmationof the stories of leakage which had come fromthe S.N.0. in Glasgowdb these the C.C. wassubmitting a report, but that I should not bein the least surprised if in the presentcircumstances leakage was occurring. Iunderstood that out of 50,000 enemy aliens,men and women, in this country, we had onlyinterned some 350 and that many of theremainder were not even subject to enemyalien restrictions. Speaking personally,I felt that the proper course would have beento intern all these people and let them showcause why they should be let out. MgrauzesustUR the policy of free admission of aliensover a period of years had presented theSecurity Service with a task which was in noway comparable to that of 1914. The fact wasthat the surface of leakage was SO large andthe collection of information SO easy, thatCatalogue Reference:KV/4/185132 32it was difficult to get down to the people whoreally mattered.S. of S. then asked about his friendROSIINSKI. I explained that ROSINSKI was former-ly a lecturer at the Military Academy in Berlinand must have many friends in the Reichswehr.He was not, strictly speaking, a refugee, and hadonly lost his post on account of his wife. Hehad then come to this country and had beenreceived everywhere. He might be anti-Nazibut there was no reason to suppose that he wasanti-German, and if a military dictatorship cameinto power in Germany his sympathies might beentirely with the enemy. We felt that peopleof that type should be under lock and key.S. of S. also wanted to know about RICHT-HOFEN and HANFSTAENGEL. I said that they weremore or less in the same category, but that thecase of HANFSTAENGEL was perhaps stronger sinceright up to the outbreak of war he had been try-ing to pave the way for his return to Germany.C.I.G.S. wanted all enemy aliens, in factall aliens, to be cleared from the Clyde Area.I said that from a departmental point of viewwe should be very pleased to ee this done, butthat it presented considerable difficulties,Wait would in all probability result in violentopposition, particularly if we had to clear thearea of friendly neutrals. Even if this could bedone, I doubted whether it would provide thesolution, since the whole area was thickly popu-lated with Irish, and no form of censorshipexisted, neither was travel between Eire andthis country properly controlled. S. of S. askedme what I thought ought to be done. I said thatin my view the censorship ought to be completeas regards telephones, telegrams and mails andCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18523the permit system should be very much tighten-ed. People should not be allowed to travelunless it could be shown that it was in thenational interest. I explained that as thingswere at presant the Germans had a Legation,a Press Bureau and sections of the Party inEire, and that if these people could have freeaccess to information in this country withoutany reasonable possibility of being detected,the whole work of M.I.5. was reduced to afarce.S. of S. then a sked whether we hadcaught any spies engaged in transmittinginformation to Germany. I said we had caughttwo, one a British subject and the other aGerman, but that for certain reasons theywould not be dealt with in the ordinary way.He was interested in the fact that one ofthem was an Englishman as it showed that theclearance of enemy aliens or even aliens fromareas might not be a solution of the problem.S. of S. then asked me whether we hadsufficient staff to deal with our problems.I said that we were very hard-pressed onaccount of the additional work imposed on thisoffice since the outbreak of war, namely, thevetting of large numbers of people who hadhad to be taken on in confidential or semi-confidential Government posts. This amountedto thousands a week. Also the work of control.ling permits to travel. It was an easy matterto get officers but a difficult problem totrain them. Given that an enquiry resultedin no trace in our records the matter was easybut if there was a trace, they case had to goto some experienced officer who could assessthe value of the information in our files.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/18534The interview was extremely informaland friendly.When I left S. of S.of S. said that ifwe had any difficulties or problems withwhich we thought he could help we had only tobring them to him.As regards general censorship of Eirehe seemed convinced that this was desrable.I mentioned the question of trainingpersonnel from Eire in D.F. work and supplyingthem with the necessary equipment free gratis.Both C.I.G.S. and S. of S. agreed that thiswas desirable.C.I.G.S. seemed to have a rather hazyidea as to who was responsible for theactivities of M.I.5. He was under the impre-ssion that we were entirely a dept. of theW.0. I suggested rather tentatively thatthere was a section of the office which wasdefinitely under W.O. control but he insistedthat the S. of S.for War was entirely res-ponsible for our activities and in the circum-stances I did not feel it politic to disillu-sion him. If somebody really thinks they a reresponsible for us, we may perhaps get some-thing done.4On return I saw Brigadier French and toldhim what S. of S. and C.I.G.S. had said, andthat they appeared at the moment to be con-vinced that complete censorship as regardsEire was essential. rig.French told me thathe had been ordered to attend a meeting ofrepresentatives of the Cabinet at the W.O. at6 p.m. The following were to be present:S. of S., First Lord, Eden,Hankey, and SircatalogurdAeference:KV/4/18 John3>Wilhelm STELLBOGEN of the D.N.B in Egypt wasarrested on the outbreak of war.

He gave mean account of yesterday' meeting. Winstoappears to have held forth and to havethumped the table. He was anxious that complete censorship should be imposed on Eireand when opposition was raised on the groundsthat this might antagonise the Irish Govt.He said dramatically "What is that to thesinking of one of our warships?"Eden eventually interposed suggesting thatthe leakage of information of which Winstoncomplained could probably only be effectiveif it were transmitted rapidly to the Ger-mans and this might equally 8o on from theClyde area direct as from Eire. He sug-gested therefore that M.I.5 should carry outintensive observation in that area. He atthe same time would try and get the Govt.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/18533of Eire to organise some .F.system inEire. It seems a pity that a representativeof M.I.5. was not present in order to ex-plain exactly what the position is (a) withregard to D.F.ing in this country and (b)in Eire.The final conclusions were as follows:l. S. of S. for Dominions should approachHigh Commissioner for Eire regarding therouting of all cable traffic ex Eire throughLondon for serutiny by the British Censor-ship authorities. (Under present arrange-ments such serutiny is only carried outhere after a delay of from 2-10 days, thearrangement being that the cable companiesfurnish copies of all cablegrams transmittedby the existing routes from Eire via theAzores to the U.S.A. This may close a possibleavenue through: the Azores via Lisbon toGermany)2. that the existing systems for li steningin to all telephone conversations betweenG.B. and Eire should be extended forthwithto Northern Ireland.3. that the illicit wireless interceptionorganisation should supply the necessaryapparatus and personnel in Eire for thedetection of possible short wave wirelesstransmitters in that country, but that thearrangement should be made direct betweenthe technical authorities concerned and notthrough diplomatic channels.4. Should the arrangements under 1-3 failto stop the present leakage of informationconsideration should be given to theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18538imposition of radical measures of telephoneand telegraphic censorship,o all trafficfrom G.B. to the whole. of Ireland on thesame lines as are now imposed on traffic toneutral ountries. This would involve a cess-ationn of telephone calls except those fromGovt.Depts.,diplomatic missions, press(after prior censorship) approved firms(after prior censorship) No other telephonecalls would be permitted and all telegramswould be be submitted to censorship beforetransmission.5. S. of S. for War should submit a state-ment on the advantages and practical poss-ibility of creating an extensive protectedarea in localities where special importanceattaches to keeping secret the presence ormovements of naval or military forces.6. that the evidence SO far is not yetaufficiently convencing to do more thanindicate that Eire may be one of severalsources of leakage of information toGermany and that it is therefore undesirableat this stage to forfeit the useful co-operation which now exists between the authoritiesin this country and in Eire by going toextreme lengths of imposing telephone andtelegraphic censorship at the risk of notonly losing this cooperation with Eire butalso of arousing considerable criticismand antagonism in this country.An arrangement has been come to with theH.O. by which in future letters of enemyalien or alien internees both in prisonsand camps will be dealt with as follows:Foreign mails by the censorship,internalmails by the prison or camp authorities whowill only refer to us for special cases.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1853918B mails will be dealt with on the samelines as far as foreign mails are concernedand internal mails will be submitted toM.I.5 only untiltheshe case has been dealtwith by the Appeal Tribunal.Younger tells me that at the moment only9% of mails to or from any country arebeing dealt with. For certain countriessuch as America there is practically nocensorship at all.NOVEMBER 3rd.Stevenson of the Censorship brought alonga man called Adams who is listening in onthe telephones to Dublin from the G.P.O.Adams has had one or two mysterious messageswhich he will send on to us in due course.In the meantime I have told him to ring upYounger or myself during the day or the nightduty officer at night if he gets a call whichhe thinks necessitates urgent action. Atthe same time I have asked Abbott at thePost Office to arrange direct lines for us toGlasgow, Liverpool and Manchester. The latterwas apparently included at a later date asone of the places whence observation should becarried out. I gather from Stevenson that uDto the present no reference to conversa-tions in the north had been received. Steven-son had evidently the impression that Col.Stirling the Censorship representative inGlasgow, was acting more or less on his own.He had begun rather stupidly by cutting thecircuits down to two. This had produced afrightful congestion and complaints. It seemsnot unlikely that all concerned will now beaware that censorship is going on. Stevensonhad heard about this and given immediateorders that the full service should be resumedCatalogue Reference:KV/4/185yoUntil we get the direet lines going we shallhave to rely on written reports which willbe dealt vith by B.12.I saw George Booth last hight. He told methat he had just seen one of his officerswho had been on board the "Clement" when shewas sunk by the "Admiral Scheer" off thecoast of Brazil. The most interesting thingthat the man had to say was thatth "AdmiralScheer" was not flying the Nazi flag but theold black,re and gold, and that nobody gavethe Nazi salute. The Captain and Chief Officeof the "Caementt were taken on board the"Admiral Scheer" and subsequently put on aGreek boat which landed up at the Cape VerdeIslands. These two men are now on their wayhome and may have something interesting toreport.There has been serious leakage affecting thevaluable informant we have in the B.U.F.Certain facts which we communicated to theComrnissioner have got back to leading lightsin the B.U.F. who have had our informant onthe mat. It seems not unlikely that JackieCarter is the culprit. He appears to have aliaison with Hawkins of the B.U.F., whom hesees on matters affecting public meetings ete.He may well have committed an indiscretion.I discussed today with V.V. the question ofvetting people who wished to go from thiscountry to France and passing information ab-out undesirables to the French in order toguide them on the question of granting visas.Our first step is to get the granting ofpermits to proceed to France placed under theMilitary Permit Office. We can then tell theFrench Consul that if a permit is granted itCatalogue Reference:KV/4/185may mean that a man is completely whitewashedby us, or that the grounds for refusing himpermission to travel are not sufficientlystrong. In such cases we should communicateany relevant facts to S.I.S. for transmissionto the 2eme Bureau, and not direct to theConsul.Hugh Fraser, who is an Air Commodore on theC.I.D. and a friend of Cumming, wished totell somebody confidentially that he wasworried about the sedurity arrangements ithe C.I.D. He said there were quantitiesof copies of Cabinet minutes etc. beingtaken off a roneo machine by girls who werenot paid more than 50/- a week and that hehad grounds for thinking that some time agoa leakage to the press had taken place fromthe C.I.D. He thought therefore that if wewere investigating these other alleged leak-ages we might do well possibly to put some-one into the Cabinet Offices in a suitableposition. I mentioned this matter to B. forhis consideration and told Fraser strictlyfor his own personal information that we hadalready been put in touch with Briages abouta possible leakage from the C.I.D. Anythingtherefore that he could tell us which pointedhowever indefinitely in any direction wouldbe of value.A Mr. W.P. Holford has reported that oneWATTS of 66 Clive Rd.Dulwich, described asthe local secretary of the BUF, has been inthe habit of returning home late at nightwith boxes containing papers which he thenproceeds to burn in his back garden. Wehave taken legal advice but unfortunatelythere seems no possibility of going in under88a since we have got to show reasonablegrounds for believing that an offence hasbeen committed. The only way to get in orCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1857 2to examine the boxes would be for the policeto treat the man as a suspeeted person andinvite him to come along to the police stationfor the examination of the boxes, or to goin under an ARP pretext.The Americans are worried about a Mrs.Jose-phine HAYWARD, British subject by marriage,who seems to have lived most of her life inGermany. This lady wants to go to U.S.A.to sell beachwear. The Americans are inclinedto let her go and have her watched on theother side.The H.0. have just submit tted a file to us whicshows that 110 Jewish students of the OrtEngineering School in Berlin were allowed inhere just before or immediately after the out-break of war. Araangements had previouslybeen made for them to come here without anyreference to us, and now the question arisesas to a suitable place for them. There areall sorts of remarks on the file about theirfuture value to industry in this country.Actually they are just the kind of people wedon't want to have in the rearmament industry.Some of them may even have been planted on us.I attended a meeting with D.S.S. and B. inthe S. of S. for War's room. S. of S. saidthat he had been attacked in the abineton the alleged inefficiency of M.I.5 andnotdiscovering the sources of extensive leakagewhich was supposed to be going on. S. of S.was very anxious to defend M.I.5 and wouldlike to know what they had to say. D.S.S.gave him a copy of the letter that we had hadfrom the B.B.C. indicating that all theserumours about braodcasts from Germany inwhich the locations of our units ete. weredisclosed seemed to be without foundation.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/185The B.B.C. have been listening in consistentlyday and night and had never heard any suchbroadcasts. They had however received simi-lar rumours which on investigation had provedto be illfounded. It boiled down to this:that up to the present noone had been able toproduce an individual with any reasonablequalifications who could say that at such andsuch a time and on such and such a wave lengthhe had heard a broadcast disclosing confid-ential formation. S. of S. was told thatwe had an enquiry on foot at the momentregarding a tank unit where the evidenceappeared to be slightly more cireumstantialbut that up to the present the position hadnot been cleared up. S. of S. seemed quiterelieved to find that Winston's stories wereonly a mare's nest. He was not altogethersurprised as he said that Winston had toldhim a few days previously that Randolph andDuncan Sandys had not received a penny of theirpay since they joined up. Enquirias showedthat they had been paid in full.S. of S. then went on to the Cabinet conclu-sions:l. Action by Mr.Eden. I explained that I hadseen Mr. Stevenson of the Dominions Officethe previous evening and that he hadarranged that Mr.Eden in addition to raisingthe question regarding the routing of tele-grams via the U.K. should also suggest to Mr.Dulanty that Eire should send technicians tothis ountry for training and that we shouldprovide them free gratis with the necessaryequipment.2. Protected areas. While it was felt thatthe creation of protected areas would notdeal with a possible leakage of informationthrough members of the I.R.A.,D.S.S. feltthat the elearing of such areas of enemy aliensCatalogue Reference:KV74/185lyuand the introduction of a pass system,woulbe of some assistance. He understood thatthe Admiralty had made a definite requestthat this should be done.3. With regard to wireless, the position wasmade clear that we had no control over thedetecting organisation but were merelyinterested in the results of their work.S. of S. sent for Brig.Martin and enquiredabout the progress being made with theconstruction of the necessary apparatus. Heseemed satisfied that things were movingas fast as possible and expressed the viewthat equipment should be provided for theGovt. of Eire.4. Question of aliens. S. of S. askedwhether we were worried about the alienproblem. We said that we were thoroughlydissatisfied with the work of the tribunals.He asked us to let him have a note aboutthis.NOVEMBER 4thA German refugee in this country has evi-dently suggested that Otto Strasseshouldcome here. Strasser's reply was that hedoes not think matters have matured suffi-ciently in Germany to make any revolutionaryaction possible. He regards 3 things asa pre-condition to revolutionary action:l. that the German people fully realisethat a state of war exists,2. that the German General Staff should beconvinced through their fruitless attacks onEngland and France that Hitler's policy hasbeen wrong?3. that the German people would have to bereally hungry.Catalogue eference:KV/4/185UusI had a discussion with Harker about ourorganisation. I felt that there was muchground that we might not be covering andthat the machinery for enquiry,particularlyin the provinces, seemed very inadequate. Ihad in mind the case of one KNOP, who has asmallshop outside Southampton Docks, and isalleged to be visited by German seamen. Thisman is clearly suspect from several points ofview. We really ought to be able to keephim under close observation, put in anagent, and keep his correspondence and tele-phone on check, if we are really going toinvestigate the case properly. At the momentwe do not seem to have th staff and machineryfor carrying this out.I provided a short memo to D.S.S. amd B.on the question of the responsibilities ofM.I.5 and the difficulties encountered incarrying these out. My idea was that some-thing of the kind should be submitted inanswer to the criticisms of M.I.5 which havebeen made in the Cabinet.The case of NEININGER has come up again.H.O. were proposing to send him before atribunal. This man is an Aryan technician ofmilitary age who a ttempted to leave thecountry. Our view was that he should beinterned under R.P. as the tribunal wouldinevitably let him out. If he appealed andwent before the Advisory Tribunal M.I.5. wouldhave an opportunity of putting forward theirreasons for his internment on general S ecuritygrounds. We put these views to the H.O. whohave now agreed to the man's internment underR.P. This is a distinct improvementNOVEMBER 5thCateogue Peferenc:K1//4p185 Reference more stories aboutGerman broadcasts on the location of our units11/6etc. I asked for specific details but couldget none.NOVEMBER 6thI recorended to Harker that we should sendletters to all C.C.S and S.C.0.s about thealleged German broadcasts and ask them tofurnish us with precise details. Alsosuggested that if in fact these broadcastsare taking place we might get C.C.s toorganise some listening service,since Col.Simpson says it would be possible for someoneto tune in noZeesen and make an announcementwithout anybody here knowing anything aboutit unless we had a detector within 7 miles,of the broadcaster.The telephone interceptions to Eire arebeginning to come in. So far there have beentwo instances of fairly obvious I.R.A.activity. They seem to be using aeroplanecommunication for travel between this countryand Eire.Younger has seen Kendal with a view to pass-ing any such information to him. He hasemphasised that the primary objeet of thisservice is to detect leakage of informationfrom this country to Germans in Eire andthatspecial care should be taken to keepsecret the fact that telephone censorshipis going on. Any action that the police takeon these messages will have to have thenecessary cover. Kendal did not appear tobe very thrilled at having the benefit ofthis service, but seemed to think that mostof the information would be already knowntoS.B.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1(u7Younger has also seen Abbott regarding thepossibility of getting direct wires from Glas-gow,Liverpool and Manchester. I thought thatppssibly we kight be able to centralise thecensorship here but apparently this is quiteimpossible for technical reasons.MARKWALD, a chemical expert employed byHuntington,Heberlein & Co. is an enemy alienwho is being employed on Govtwwork at theR.O.F. at Irvine. Our clause about peopleof this sort being allowed to work for a firmprovided they are kept away from Govt.confiden-tial work is obviously a farce.Sir Reginald Clarry has made a complaint aboutCARP and de VOOGT. He evidently thinks thatthey were rather roughly handled at ports.Maxwell has asked for an explanation.D.S.S. agreed to the engagement of Gooch whowill be employed on Japanese work.Curry has produced a memo on firms withGerman ramifications suggesting drastic action.I am asking D.S.S. what powers we have fordealing with the situation.One .W.Donald is going to Manchester inthe censorship and will be controlling thelines to Eire.. We have given him a letter tothe local C.C.The Governor of Guernsey is worried about aGerman called ZULAUF who was arrested onaccount of his Party membership. There is nointernment camp at Guernsey and Z. is languish-ing as the sole inmate of the prison. He cantappeal as there is no body in Guernsey regardedas august enough. Cooper has remarked ratherCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1851y&curiously that if he is sent over here he willprobably be released. Had we known of thesituation in Guernsey we might have sent allour suspects over there before the outbreak ofwar.Lady Lees of Dorset has issued a pamphleton pacifist religious lines which has cometo the notice of the 2eme bureau. They areextremely worried and want if possible to havethis literature suppressed at the source.in actual fact the pamphlet is quite mildand cannot possibly be dealt with under exist-ing regulations. We have already condonedfar worse things from the PPU and BUF.NOVEMBER 7thHad a discussion with Adam regarding his memofor S. of S. on the organisation of M.I.5 andits responsibilities. It was suggested thatsome recommendation should be made that MI5should be responsible to a committee of theWar Cabinet, and D.S.S. did not wi sh to putthis into the memo as he thought that Horebmight seize the opportunity to get control ofthe whole of MI5'S activities. This obviouslywould not do as the organisation must havedealings with the other fighting services. Iftherefore we were.a W.O.Dept. our task indealing with them would be rendered almostimpossible. D.S.S. finally decided to go andsee Lord Hankey and get him to devise some meanby which we could have direct access to theWar Cabinet when we want ed to get a decisionon matters of importance affecting other depts.KUCHENMIESTER has come up again. Various peopleconnected with him in business want him toreturn in order that he can run our rearmamentindustry. The whole thing is rather like AliceCatalogue Reference:KV/4/185uain Wonderland. H.0. suggest that he shouldbe allowed to come and take his chance beforethe tribunal.The question for decision is whether he isbetter in Eire where he cannot have directaccess to our rearmament industry or in thiscountry under restrictions. I am inclinedto say that if the Home Secretary wouldundertake to place him under close res-trictions in spite of any decision ofthe tribunal, we are prepared to let himcome and put his case before the tribunal.Stevenson,Eden' secretary, spoke to metoday about the Minister's visit to Dulanty.Dulanty is taking up with his govt. thequestion of setting up a wireless detectingorganisation in Eire but has asked what theapproximate cost would be. I told Stevensonthat both S. of .,C.I.G.S. and Col.Butler hadexpressed the view that this equipment shouldbe furnished free of charge. Stevensonthought that the most tactful way of puttingit would be to say that we were quite ready toloan them the necessary equipment. Beforefinally making a decision he would at mysuggestion communicate with ol.Butler M.I.8c.Hans SCHUBERT, an Aryan specialst in ironand steel, is writing a book on the historyof iron and steel in this country. He hasfor some time had the run of the Iron andSteel Institute and Library and Hope Morleywho writes in to the tribunal on his behalf,is anxious that he should continue to do SO.I am finding out whether any eonfidentialinformation is to be obtained and suggestedin any case that SCHUBERT should be interned.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/185/870One Charles Prettyman, a sailor on the EmeraldQueen, situated at Loch Sween, has on 3 occa-sions sent a telegram "Many happy returns"to 7 Whitcombe St.Aberdare.

The German bombers and fightersapparently have no rear gun. The range ofhe German fighters appears to be limitedind this may to some extent act as a deterrentto long distance bombing, since it is thepractice of the German bombers to be accom-panied by fighters,wh have a somewhat limitedrange.I now hear that the Custodian of EnemyProperty only deals with the property ofenemies resident in enemy country. Theproperty of enemies in neutral countries orin this country is a matter for Mr. J.G.Henderson B.O.T.At yesterdaye.s board meeting D.D.S. statedthat he had got the H.0. to agree that noalien should be employed in a scheduled occupa-tion without M.I.5's consent. The necessarymachinery to deal with this question isbeing set up.CollAllan raised the question of a press offic-er. It was arranged that Col.Adam who hadpreviously gone into the question,shoulddiscuss it with Ir.Sheppard.The question was also raised as to whether anofficer of standing should not be appointedto deal with registry matters.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/185NOVEMBER 8thK. went to see Hankey last night. He toldhim our difficulties in not having directaccess to anyone in the War Cabinet who couldexercise the necessary authority in havingcertain of our recommendations put intoforce. Hankey thoroughly appreciated ourpoint of view and said that he thought theMinister for Co-Ordination and Defence wasreally the person who should be respon-sible. He undertook to sound Lord Chat-field.We received an extraordinary request todaycoming E think from the Ministry of Information.Somebody wants to come and see us to discussan exchange of photographs between ourselvesand the Germans. It seems to be one moreillustration of the extraordinary mentalitywhich prevails about the war in certainquarters. The suggestion to me is positivelyindecent.Air Ministry reports show that the Germansseem to be relying more on speed for theirbombers rather than on armaments. It seemsthat the German Air Force have done a certainamount of mass landing by parachutes on theRussian model and that the tacties involvethe seizing of some strategic point orlanding men for reinforcements.NOVEMBER 9th,lOth and l1thAway from the office with a cold.NOVEMBER 12thDiscussed with S.N.0. Glasgow enquiries whichhad been carried out there into the variousrumours indicating leakage of information.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/185(s2He said that in conjunction with the C.C.15 cases had been investigated but that inno case had it been substantiate that abroadcast had taken place. He said thatsimilar rumours had been going about in theOrkneys.S.I.S. had a serious loss in the death ofold "C" last Monday.Today comes the news of another blow.Stevens the P.C.O. at the Hague who has beenin touch with certain elements in the Reichs-wehr, was shot on the Dutch-German frontierlast Thursday and his body taken off by theGestapo. It seems also that Best and possiblyothers were kidnapped. No details are as yetavailable. The danger is that S. generallycarried a list of his agents in his vest-pocket. Nobody knows at the monent whathe had on him. Dick immediately got intotouch with his agent at the Hague, whoseidentity was known to S. and instructed her tomake her way to Brussels and return by plane.This she has done, bringing some veryinteresting information about German intentionin Holland. It seems that the plan was toinvade Belgium via the little triangle ofDutch territory by Maastricht. It was thoughtchat this would cause us to violate Belgianneutrality and SO give the Germans the excuseto advance on Ostend and Zeebrugge. Forsome reason or other the plan was called offlate on the evening of the lOth, whetherpermanently or temporarily is not known.The Stevens incident will be a great blowto lose S.I.S. the services and also of to an ourselves, extremely since valuable weagent who had succeeded in getting well inat the Hague.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/185$3NOVEMBER 13thA correspondent of the News Chronicle calledFORREST is trying to get a permit to go toFrance to write up articles on the FrenchNavy. He alleges that he has the supportof the Aamiralty and the French Ministry ofMarine. We cannot find that he has anysupport from the Admiralty and are refusinghim a permit.I saw Mr. Grubb of the Post Office at Liver-pool today. He had been responsible for thetelephone censorship from Liverpool to Dublinand Belfast. Results up to date show thatthere is considerable indiseretion on thetelephone, by seamen telephoning to theirgirls and saying that they cannot visit thembecause they are going out with a convoyetc. There have also been some pretty badconversations from firms in Belfast sayingthat they are going to supply large quantitiesof bombs to this and that depot and thatthese bombs will be sent by certain shipsleaving on certain dates. Nothing has beenheard SO far which would indicate a seriousleakage of information. At present the SCO,SNO and local police are cooperating asregards action. In one case the policehave "discreetly"( interviewed a factorymanager on the subjeet of some conversation.They would probably say that it was one ona "pretext". My experience of these pretextsis that they are invariably of a very obviouskind. I think it is important that weshould send a responsible B.officer up toLi erpool,Manchester and Glasgow in orderto ensure that any enquiries that are made areproperly carried out and that in certaincases no enquiries are made at all.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/18104Internees The following are the figures at theend of October:Interned by MI5 HQ.14 m.47 f.SCo's349 m.LY f.11I1Tribunals177 m.44 f.ft11Police132 m.35 f.Total799 m. 137 f.The total number of Germans and Austriansin the country over 16 years of age was estima-ted at roughly over 74,000.

Theywant him shadowed from the port and kept underobservation. It is of the greatest importancethat this man should not become aware that he isthe subject of observation. As things are atpresent there is no really satisfactory machin-ery for carrying out this work. I had a talkwith Adam and Allan and suggested that weshould appoint 2 or 3 Field Security Police-Len in each port for detective work, the ideabeing that they would go through the B.6 school.These people might ultimately form the nucleusof some kind of provincial Port Enquiry Agency.This is very much neededas at the moment wehave no real machinery in the provinces. Idiscussed this also with Harker and pointed outthat really our facilities for Yenquiry at themoment are very little better than they are inpeace time. In some ways they are even worsebecause we have SO many more cases to deal with.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/185We have no thorough means of investigatingactivities of enemy aliens outside the Met.Area. In Many cases we have to be contentwith a somewhat colourless report from a C.C.or with postal observation which only involvesopening about 10% of the man's letters.At the end of a month'S enquiry therefore weare generally very little further forward thanwe were at the beginning.The case of JACKH has come up again.The Ministry of Information got rid of himon their reduction of staff. Tom Jones ofthe Cabinet Secretariat has reported thatJACKH told a friend of his some time agothat during the last war he had worked in theGerman S.S. in Turkey. JACKH is of course nowa naturalised British subject, and instead ofbeing in the Ministry of Information he shouldbe in an internment camp.Drinkwater tells me that aliens at the rateof about 2 a week are reporting to the policewith a hard-luck story that they arrived hereas stowaways from one port or another inEurope. These people are stateless or have nodocuments. The normal course is to instructthem to report to the police every 24 hours.Drinkwater is wondering whether there maynot be some scheme for planting agents onus by this means. I have asked him to refersuch cases and also to find out from the policewhether these people. do report regularly orwhether in fact they are at large. My ownview is that they should be interned. Itseems that they have the right to work here.NOVEMBER 14thRoger tells me that our great superiorityover the Germans in the air is in gun turrets.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/185$6which enable us to traverse in any direction.Production was at one time held up on accountof these turrets but is now going full steamahead. The Germans have hardly begun onturrets.T.A.R. has just returned from Belfast. Theyinvestigated one rather suspicious case atPortrush , but SO far the enquiries are incon-clusive. The Belfast deteeting station whichis singularly well-placed, has picked upseveral people believed to be communicatingto or from Germany,possibly from this country.T.A.R.'S impression of the local police issomewhat similar to the one I gained more thana year ago. The issue between the Orangemenand the I.R.A. is the thing that really countsand espionage matters are of secondaryimportance. There is also a certain wilanessin the reports which are obtained by Ulster.We hope, through the Command Security Officerwho seems intelligent and is well in with thelocal authorities, to get these matters siftedlocally before they are passed on to us.We had a Board Meeting tonight. D.D.S. explain-ed various measures which have been agreedupon by the H.O. for preventing aliens frompenetrating our rearmament industry. It wasagreed however that registration certificatesshouldonlyreceivethenecessarystampauthorising permsssion to work in a particularoccupation if applicatton were made by a firm.In other words, we could not give a guaranteeabout an individual which would enable him towork anywaere in his particular trade. Weshould have to be guided by the circumstancesof his employment and the nature of the workthat happened to be going on in that factoryat that time.I raised the question of the lack of resultsCatalogue Reference:KV/4/185$7we were receiving from H.O.W.s The Post Officedo not pretend to take more than 10% on some400 H.O.W.s which are at present in operation.I said that this was only one side of ourinvestigation work which was being severelyhampered. The fact was that we were singularlyill-equipped for dealing with any enquiriesin the provinces. We could not hope to getmore than 10% of the letters. Only withdifficulty could we impose a telephone check.In certain C.C.s areas we could get nosatisfactory observation and we had no ade-quate machinery for putting in an agent. Theresult was that there were hundreds of caseswhich after a rather superficial investigationof a month had to be laid aside. An a deaddifficulty was that owing to a general lackpolicy we could not narrow down the surfaceof our enquiries. It was agreed that Boothshould be asked to look into the question ofH.O.W.SThe P.P.U. have now asked whether Peace Newswhich has been refused an export permit canbe allowed to go out through W.H.Smith &c Sonwho have a general license. This only goesto show how farcical the whole positior is.Moreover if anybody wishes to evade theexport permit they can perfectly well do Soby sending the literature to France on whidthere is no censorship and having it re-export-ed to other countryes. We have drawn theattention of the H.0. to the position andsuggested that the whole question should beput in order,particularly in view of theanxiety of the French about pacifist propa-ganda.NOVEMBER 15thI saw Col.Stirling today when he explained tome the position in Glasgow regarding telephoneCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1851S8censorship on Eire. We have arranged thatin the ordinary way suspicious conversationsshould be reported to M.C.4 and passed on tous. If the matter is urgent it should betelephoned on one of the trunk lines arrangedfor by Abbott, either to Younger or myself,or at night the night duty officer should beasked for. In cases of extreme urgency wehave agreed that the Censorshipnofficer shouldconsult the appropriate authorities on thesubject and initiate the necessary action.We have asked however that we shall beinformed at the earliest possible moment.A man named FUNK, an Aryan German employed bythe Loewy Co. was interned by us as a memberof the D.A.F. Agitation is now going on forhis release. We have had him interrogated andhave been told that he is thoroughly Germanin his outlook and that he has no particulardesire to go back to Lowey. There are fourother full aryan Germans employed by the firmwho as far as we can see are in the same boat.Out of 90 employees there are some 12 otheraliens of various sorts. It seems incrediblethat these Germans should be allowed to r emainin the firm in spit of the protests of theAir Ministry who attach importance to theExtrusion Presses that are made there. We arerecommending that they should all be intern-ed.Stephens tells me that to date we have interned271 Germans and 17 British subjects underDR.18b. S.C.0.s have interned 98. 45 havebeen relased. 341 still remain interned.These figures of course do not include tribunalor people interned by C.C.S on their own initiative. B.8. have interrogated 103 interneesand have passed 4,000 tribunal cases over therecords, of which roughly 500 produced a trace.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/185L59Out of these 500 the information was sufficientin whole or in part in 120 cases to cause thetribunal to intern the individual concerned.This vetting of tribunal cases of course onlyapplies to the Met.Area. Had our recordsbeen consulted throughout the country there isno doubt that farngreater numbers would havebeen interned.Archer tells me that the censorship have inter-cepted a telegram to the New York PressService from an American journalis herecalled Nixon. The telegram referred to aninvention alleged to be in use by the Germansfor penetrating cloud banks by infra-red rays.The pilot can fly above the clouds and at thesame time see his bombing target It was saidin the meesage to New York that the British AirMinistry did not attach much importance to thisalleged invention. As a matter of fact they haTbeen working on it for some time and were veryalarmed by the telegram being sent. Theytherefore instructed the censorship to have itstopped, but obviously did not realise thatconfirmatior in writing would probably be sentand would not be subject to censorship. Theresult is of course that the correctness ofthe information in the original telegram willbe confirmed, by the fact that it has beensuppressed by the censorship. It is diffi-cult to know how to centralise these things.The case illustrates clearly how dangerousit is for Ministries to deal direct on thesematters. I have suggested that the telegramshould be sent on,even though it has been heldup for 6 weeks, and that Nixon should beapproached in order to find out the source ofhis information.V.V. came over today and told me about Stevens.They did not know a great deal as nobody inCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18516the original party appears to have survived.A meeting had been arranged at the frontierwith certain German Staff Officers. Stevens,Best and two Dutchmen had been to the frontierby car but nobody had turned up. On the secondday they got a message to say that the officerswould be there on the following day. Whenthey a rrived on the third day they parked thecar within 40 yardsa of the frontier. A Germancar arrived. The officers surrounded Stevenscar and the first man to get out was shot.Then Stevens got out and was also shot. Twomenremained in the car, whether the two Dutchmeror Best and one Dutchman, is not known, andthe Germans pushed it over the frontier. TheDutch guards and any onlookers were intimidatedby the Gestapo and did not dare to intervene.The whole plot was known to the Dutch GeneralStaff and itseems not unlikely that the memberof the staff,SAss, previously reported on byP. as a German agent, was responsible forgiving the show away. SASS who had been sent toBerlin was evidently back at the Hague,sincea picture appeared of him in consultation withthe rest of the staff in "Picture Post" onlyabout 10 days ago. The Dutch are terrified anddo not wish to make any protest. The French whoare also concerned, and have a number of Gestapoin tow, are contemplating some counter-action,which will not perhaps do much good.NOVEMBER l6thThe Committee of the War Cabinet has reportedon steps taken to warn public and GovernmentDepts. against discussion of confidentialmatters in pubbic places. It seems that agreat deal has been done in this matter. TheMinistry of Information are primarily respon-sible for warning the general public and areGatalogue Reference:KVT47185to work in close collaboration with the Security6lH.0. have refused to support us in the easeof William Downie FORREST, Communist corres-pondent Of the News Chronicle who wishes togo to France to report on the French Fleet.The man is to have a permit but we are to warnthe French SO that they do not give him a visa.Archer has sent me a personal letter aboutBritish soldiers,sailors and airmen appearingin Dublin in uniform. A sergeant of the IrjGuards was seen the other day complete withsidearms. Archer says this is not his businessand not directly mine, but that he feels wewould be doing each other a mutual service ifwe could prevent incidents which may developinto a source of friction and trouble. Thereis already a body in existence called theIrish Neutrality League which from the leafletsArcher sent must be very near the I.R.A. Theycomplain amongst other things that a Dublinfirm is trying to persuade its employees tojoin the British Anmy by offering to keep themon the pay-roll while they are on active ser-vice. To remedy this it was suggested thatpassports should be refused by the Eire Govt.to all men who were leaving Ireland to fightin imperialist wars. It is not explainedexactly how the Eire Govt. are to know whethera man is leaving for the purpose of enlist-ing in the British Army.Soviet espionage seems to be on the increase.Jane has no got a man in the Russian TradeDelegation wh Omshe would like to get at.Unfortunately the premises at 51/53 Hatton Gans.are immune under the latest Trade Treaty.We are still looking for a man in the C.I.D. whowas reported to us by Levine through Krevitsky.We are trying to g et K. himself to come overhere if possible and we are also trying to getCatalogue ReterenceekVt4(85Holland. Both these(62people should help us to clear the matter up.I had a talk today with Shepherd of theTreaties Dept. of the F.0. who is now in chargeof the negotiations over the exchange ofprisoners. He tells me that there are about2-3,000 British subjects in Germany of whomonly about 117 are internedao Many of them hegathers are only technically British subjects.The Germans are more or less prepared toagree to repatriating people of militaryage on a reciprocal basis. In other words theyrealise that we are in a strong positionnumerically, and are out to make a good bargainI explained to Shepherd that we were interestedin getting rid of quite a number of Germans,particularly women, provided they were isolatedfor a period. If an isolation camp were setup we could get on with this instead of havingthe people left at large. He seemed quite keenabout his,particularly since the Germans aremaking a fuss about their women being in prisonhere and are threatening to put ours in prisonunless something is done to improve the condi-tions. I said that we should be quite pleasedto see these women put into an isolation campbut that as things were there was no internmentcamp for women at all. If he could move theH.0. to do something about the matter weshould be only too glad, provided they aidnot open a camp in the north of Scotland or thewilds of Cornwall. Shepherd said he wouldspeak to Cooper on the whole question and letme know the result.A Mr. A.J. Espley has sent a copy to the HomeSecretary of a letter he has written to theRefugees Co-ordinating Committee,BloomsburyHouse,W.c.l. He says that when an appeal forhelp for Jewish refugees was made by EarlCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18563Baldwin he took on a Mr. Walter BENDIX in hishome and that this man has been with him eversince. When the arrangement was originallymade he was told that the man would be goingto America. He now wants to know if he isactually to go and what steps are being takento relieve the country of the onerous burdenof keeping and feeding these refugees. Hethinks that they should be given farm work.He continues that although Mr.BENDIX is agentleman of the highest repute "one cannotbe sure from day to day of the loyalty ofanyof these Germans, whether Jewish or not"andalthough he has no grounds for saying itbeyond a general feeling that when broadcastreports are received these refugees cannot helpshowing either elation or disappointment at thenews, wt the dividing. lines between theirloyalty to this country 1s very,very narrow.He thinks that some efficient protection shouldbe organised against any undesirable elements.In his opinion it is a difficult matter tosegregate the good from the bad unless a generalinternment order is made.NOVEMBER 17thOne Ernst HIJMANS, a Dutchman, wants to establishhimself here as an engineering consultant.He makes recomendations regarding thespeeding up of production machinery but unlikethe BedeaUs system he is concerned with themachines and not with the personnel. We haveobjected on general grounds that an alienshould not be employed on work of this kindwhich must inevitably bring him into closecontact with our rearmament work.I have suggested that no permits should begranted to enemy aliens wishing to go to Eirewhether they have passed the tribunals or not.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/185( 64 6 4D.S.S. has mentioned this matter to Maxwell whohas promised to discuss the question with theS. of S. This is really only one of the lineson which permits should be tightened up.Adam told me.a very bad visa case today. Aman in this country had recommended to theH.0. that a German woman in Denmark should begranted a visa for the U.K. We had objectedan general grounds but as we had no specificformation against the woman we were over-ruled by the H.0. When the PCO receivedinstructions to grant a visa he reported backthat the woman seemed undesirable and wasclosely associated with local Germans. Thecase is hanging fire at the moment but it showshow security grounds are subordinated to thepolicy of the H.O.ol.Backhouse called here today. He had justreturned from Liverpool whenehe had organisedthe telephone censorship to Eire. He had seenour latest instructions about taking action onmessages received and thought they were quitesound as a temporary measure but he shared myanxiety about the general situation and thenecessity of co-ordinating the various con-flicting points of view. He is coming in for another talk.The following is the position with regard toexport of printed matter to censored countries.Under S.R.& 0.1939 No.1440 a permit must beobtained for the export to any country coveredby the censorship for newspapers,books plansetc. and any article regarding or containinginformation. Certain specific Classes of docu-ments are excepted from this provision. Permitsare obtained from the Deputy Chief Censor,Permits Branch, who has a head office at Aintreeand Catalogue a branch ReterencesRvi4/185ndon. ndon. Permits are(6Srequired whether the material is sent by post,by freight or by hand.1. Transmission by post.Nobody can transmit printed matter by postunless he holds a permit or unless he can finda permit-holder to do it for him. Materialtransmitted by permit-holders is examinedfrom time to time as a check upon their bonafides. Permits are not granted to individualbut only to firms. A permit holder may ex-port any of his own publications providedtheyare not on the Black List (at present no BlackList exists) and also the publications ofother permit-holders. (No list of permit-hold-ers has yet been issued). Single copies ofpublications sent by letter post are submittedto the postal censor, but at present the out-ward mails to only about 6 foreign countriesare being censored and not more than 20% ofthese are opened.2. Transmission by freight.Material of this sort does not pass through thecensor's hands at all. The exporter obtainsa censor'S certificate to the Customs Officerwho checks it with the list of permit-holders.The goods are examined only to ascertainthat they are of the class covered by thepermit.3. Transmission by hand.S.C.0.s at ports are responsbiel for theexamination of printed or written mattercarried by hand. They have power to detainall documents of whatever nature, but may attheir discretion pass anything which seemsto be harmless. They do not normally searchCatalogue Reference:KV/4/185C 66 6passengers. There is a special system bywhich permit holders (firms) can obtain inadvance permi sion for one of their repre-sentatives to take documents out of thecountry. The documents are taken to thePermit Office and sealed up. The represen-tative signe a slip at the permit office whichhe later presents to the S.0.0. at the port,in whose presence he again signs the slip.Lists of those to whom permits are grantednave SO far not been vetted except in a fewcases. There appears to be no organisationwhich serutinises books or papers With a viewto controlling their export. Ministry ofInformation censors press telegrams and isbelieved to bring pressure to bear on journ-alists who submit telegrams for censorship.The censorship is however theoreticallyvoluntary. Nobody scrutinises books lawfullypublished in the U.K. Some wholesal ers willprobably ask the censors advice before exportinbooks about which they are doubtful, but theyare under no legal obligation to do SO.It seems that Eire are quite ready to cooperatein the matter of sending wireless experts andthat there has been a ready response to Eden'sbproach to Dulanty. Two experts have arrivedhere to undergo a course.I have discovered a new organisation calledM.I.L(C) It seems to be their business toexamine inventions,suggestions and planssubmitted to the War Office, however fantasticthese may be.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1857NOVEMBER l8thDiscussed with D.S.S. the case of John Lehmann.Nichols of the F.O. has spoken to me again abouour recommendation against Lehmann's appoint-ment in the Ministry of Information. I havesuggested to D.S.S. that we should set out thefull facts of this case and that instead ofNichols coming to see him as suggested,D.S.Sshould show the relevant doc uments to Cadoganand settle the matter once and for all.Adam has put up a memo on the question oftravel and has inserted the note that 1 madeout some time ago about dealing with cate-gories.Curry's memo about the Mercedes Company andthe Concrete Pump Company ete. has been gonethrough by the Legal Section and is going tobe submitted by then to Christie who I under-stand is the legal adviser to that dept. ofthe B.O.T. dealing with the trading with theenemy. The idea is that we should get someform o$ legislation to deal with the ituation.We have stopped two censorship officers fromgoing to Gib. Their names were Harcourt andChapman. They were friends and one of themis under some suspicion on account of apolice report the contents of which are beinginvestigated. We have another very bad casein the censorship. A woman has written anextremely indiscreet letter to Shishmareff,a suspect American of Russian rigin whomwe have on check. She told him amongst otherthings Where she was working and that there isa black list and a white list. She thoughtmoreover that Claud Cockburn would be interestedto know that he was on the black list.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/185168 LThe case is being taken up by the D.P.P.Censorship in Palestine picked up an interest-ing letter showing that ther is a Germanagent in Batavia reporting on movements ofships and other matters of importance througha cover address in Holland. LANGINDERGS.I.S. reports indicate that the Dutch venturewas probably called off owing to differencesbetween Hitler and his General Staff. Italy1S still maintaining her attitude of veiledhostility towards the Germans. Himmler's visitwhich was to have paved the way for a visit byGoering was evidently a failure.I have read through the Advisory Committee'snote on the case of Bode of the German HospitalThey have released him on restrictions. Theyyook the view that the retention of his Gemmannationality in spite of his naturalisation wasan ordinary normal legal formality necessitatedby his official position. It is just possiblethat this may have been excusable but it is difficult to see how they can have got over hisjoinging the Nazi party after he had beoome anaturalised British subject.m,A.R. tells me that one of the notes whichwas paid to Snow as part of his salaryby a woman who postedothe letter from Bourne-mouth and subsequently from Southampton andLondon, has been traced to Selfridges. Enquirythere showed that she had obtained this notein exchange for treasury notes. An accuratedescription of the woman has been given. Sheis evidently in the habit of posting her lettersat different places at irregular intervals.A local search of the mails for similar envel-opes therefore might not be of much use unlessCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1856awe ean find that she makes regular use ofone particularlocality.Craig rang me up to say that a Petty Officernamed Burns from the "Royal Sovereign" hadhad a telegram sent to him c/o Royal SovereignBelfast, from a girl called Lena. The girlwas asking for money. Burns had just beenon laave and met this girl. Enquiries arebeing made as to what he knows about her. Theinteresting thing is that the Royal Sover-eign is not at Belfast, but that there isa dummy ship there which is supposed to bethe Royal Sovereign. The question is how didthe girl, who sent her telegram from Dublin,come to think that the Royal Sovereign was atBelfast?NOVEMBER 19thWinchester.Saw George Booth in the evening. He had seenthe captain of the Clement which was repertedtehave sunk Off the coast of Brazil, sometime ago. The captain had been taken on boarda boat which he believed to be the AdmiralScheer and which he has described in detailto the Admiralty. He is certain she was theAdmiral Scheer because when passing underher hull he saw the name in embossed letters,which had been painted out. He also saw inthe captain's room a little model lifebaatover his bed with "Ad imiral Scheer" painted onit.The Clement first sighted what they thoughtto be a British warship. Then a German planeflew over them and fired 3 volleys with amachine gun. He stopped the boat and toldhis men to take to the boats. A pinnace cameCatalogue out e"Reference:kVf4/T85e the gheer and took the1 120captain and the first officer on board.They were very well treated and taken to anupper deck. The Captain of the Scheer saidhe was sorry but he would have to sink theClement. He first fired a torpedo, whichowing to the swell missed its mark, goingclear of the bows. He then fired anothertorpedo, which also missed its mark, justclearing the stern. They next fired about25 shells from a 6" gun, and failed to securea direct hit. Lastly they turned on the l1"gun which succeeded in hitting the Clement5 times and sinking her. Shortly afterwardsthe captain of the Scheer announced that hehad sighted a Greek ship and that he wasgoing to put the captain and first offider onboard. This he did and they landed up atCape Verde Island.NOVEMBER 20thA number of Dutch and Germans have beenlanded here from the Simon Bolivar which wassunk two days ago. As soon as they recoverwe intend to interrogate the Germans whowere bound for Batavia and may have somethingto do with German S.S. activities there.Princess HOHENLOHE has lost her case againstRothermere and is to be allowed to leaveNith her mother for the United States. She wilhave a special exis permit which in the worasof the Permit Office "ensures that she and hermother will be put through the canteen".A long report about her which is I believe forpublication in the American magazine "Timethas been sent to the H.0. by Baron FrankensteinThe report is written by von Hofmanstahl andalleges that Rothermere received very largesums from the Germans in order to carry outCatalogue Referencek/4/8517Swedish civil aircraft are landing at Perthand Danish and Dutch at Shoreham. Steps arebeing taken to isolate the pilots as S.I.S.say that they are being used as German agents.There is talk of an air service between Foynesand Amsterdam by KLM. We are going into this,It is possible that some such service mayhave existed while the Atlantic Clipper wasgoing from Foynes.According to the Latvian Military Attachehere, when Latvia and Esthonia signed non-agression pacts with Germany they were givena solemn assurance of German support in theevent of aggression by Russia.The Dutch Minister had an interview withHalifax on Nov.13th. The Dutch Ministerwas still doubtful about German intentionsas the preservation of Rotterdam as a neutralport was of great value to them. He thoughtit possible that the Germans might make anattack on the Texel Island and the islandlying to the north of it. In such an eventual:ity he hoped the British Fleet would be ableto give assistance in the fortification ofthe islands. He also intimated confidentiallythat Roosevelt had conveyed to the GermanGovt. that any violation of Dutch neutralitywould exercise an immediate and possiblyunforseen influence on American policy.He had reason to believe that this represen-tation had been of great value. The Ministerthoughtthat Belgium would move if Holland wereinvaded but they had no precise informationabout this point. He was certain that Hitlerwas in adesperate mood but he thought thatit would be dangerous to suppose that Germanywas in a state of internal revolution. Inthis connection he said that his Govt. weresatisfied that our leaflets were having theopposite effect to that which was intended.Catalogue ReferenCe:KV/4/1854 22NOVEMBER 20thAt the board meeting today two major questionswere raised (1) travel permits and (2) thevetting of aliens wishing to be employed inrestricted occupations.D.S.S. said that he had studied the memo putup by Col.Adam and had had a talk withStafford. Stafford took the line that itwould be impossible to restrict travel onthe lines that we desired. Adam pointed outthat at the moment there were no guidingprinciples whatever and that unless we elemin-ated whole categories the work of this officewould be seriously hampered. D.S.S. and D.D.Sthought the answer to the H.0. would be oneof implicit faith in M.I.5. who would alwaysbe able to say from their records whether aman should or should not travel. I said thatthis was really no good from our point of viewsince we erelquite unable to say anything ofthe kind and only by the elimination of wholecategories could we narrow our enquiries downto the people who really mattered. D.S.S. saidthat he and D.D.S. would go and see Maxwellon the whole question.The policy with regard to restricted occupa-tions involves the notification by allemployers within 7 days that they require apermit for any alien or enemy alien who wasat present in their employ, to be allowed tocontinue his work. Application will also haveto be made in cases of new employees. Theseapplications will be sent to a box number andwill be collected and sent to M.I.5. Theywill be dealt with by a special section andregistration books will be stamped authorisinga man to work in a restricted occupation regard-Catalogue less of RefererTCe RefererTCe:KV/4/185ic} he is to be23 3employed. I pointed out that under thissystem it would be necessary to take a verycautious view. Application forms would givea good deal of information and if there wasany doubt whatever the answer would be "No".This will probably lead to a great many pro-tests which will reach us from the H.0..Ministry of Supply and other departments. Itremains to be seen how far the scheme will beworkable.S.I.S. reports show that the Germans havereacted to propaganda and that in generalthere is afeeling of considerable hostility toEngland and in a very much lesser degree toFrance. Goering, the Army and the F.0.,seem to be anxious to arrive at some earlysolution of the present impasse. They evi-dantly think that it would be far better tomake peace now. It is urged that the invasionof neutral countries will bring the U.S.A.into the war and completely alienate Italy.Generally speaking, there is discord anduncertainty in official circles.NOVEMBER 21stRowe-Dutton of the Treasury has written to usto say that the Bank of England are veryanxious to arrange a procedure for carry-ing out investigations when a telegramwhich excites their interest reaches them fromthe censorship. What they would like wouldbe a very close liaison with some individualofficer, whether of the H.O. or M.I.5. whowould be able to make enquiries under theDefence Finance Regulations. Although suchan officer would be working in close liaisonwith the Bank he would be, of Course, enquiringon behalf of the Treasury and would be fullyarmed by the Bank with anything he mightrequire on the technical side. I have repliedCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18524that this is not a matter which M.I.5. couldvery well undertake, although they might beinterested if it were found that funds werebeing transmitted to this country for purposesof propaganda or espionage. I have suggestedthat the Treasury should appoint somebodywith the necessary qualifications who wouldbe empowered to issue warrants under 80aand direct investigations which would becarried out by the Police.A British subject named CATFORD who has acriminal record has been found in possession ofan Italian passport in the name of Barlatti.CATFORD said that he was collecting informationabout ships for some organisation. It isthought that he may be an Italian agent.A letter has been intercepted hrough theCensorship imposed on the Orkneys. It waswritten by a man at Scapa to his mother atWallasey. It as not quite clear whether theman is in Govt.employ or not. He gives acertain amountof detail about ships and the layout of Scapa but it is questionable whetherhe has said anything that could not have beenobserved by any ordinary resident. Is it anoffence to record information of this sort ina letter to a relation? The actual record-ng of information which might be useful tothe enemy is an offence under Section 3 of D.R.only if such recording is likely to prejudicethe defence of the realm or the efficientprosecution of the war.Unless therefore the writer who after all isonly communicating with his mother, can beshown to be acting for a purpose prejudicial,it would not seem that any proceedings wouldbe likely to sueceed. I have asked S.L. fortheir opinion.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/185125A meeting was held on lOth November on thesubjeet of protected areas for aliens at navalbasis. The following ports were to bedeclared proteeted areas immediately:The Forth, Harwich, Humber, Dover, Plymouth,Portsmouth,Medway and possibly the Clyde.Subsequently similar action was to be takenas regards Portland, Blythe, Dundee, FalmoutMersey, Milford Haven, the Thames and theTyne.Residence of aliens belonging to category B.was to be prohibited unless a permit had beengranted by the chief of police of the district,At the discretion of the chief of police,category C. aliens maguhbe placed in category BNo new alien residents would be allowed unlessthey had a special permit. The chief ofpolice could if necessary apply for an orderto have resident aliens removed from thedistrict.Russia and Japan are showing signs of comingtogether. A settlement has been arrived atas regards the Manchukuoan border and thereis talk of some kind of trade treaty. Theseindications have appeared in S.I.S. reportand are now confirmed in the newspapers.NOVEMBER 22ndA statement has been issued by Himmler onthe Munich Bomb Plot that it is attributedto a German subject who was found crossingthe German-Swiss frontier. The British S.S.are of course at the back ofit and theStevens and Best incident has been dragged in.The Germans allege that Stevens and Best wereCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18526attempting to cross the Dutch frontier andwere arrested, but state that enquiries arestill proceeding as to whether they were onGerman or Dutch soil. They infer that peoplein Germany with whom Stevens and Best werein touch they supposed to be disaffectecelements, but were in reality agents of theGestapo. Himmler states however that theGermans had been supplied with a wireless setfor communications by the British and hadbeen in touch with the British Govt. eversinceAt about 7 o'clock Percival of M.I.l.a.rang up to say that he had a War Cabinetmemo on a proposal to set up a secret intelli-gence organisation in Eire. He had beenasked to brief S. of S. for the Cabinetmeeting tomorrow and wanted a report from usby 8.30 a.m. Percival himself knew nothingabout the question and did not know why thememo had been sent to him. I went up to theW.0. and found that the memo was based on areport submitted by NID to the First Lord, whohad asked for its urgent consideration by hiscollegues. I eventually sueceeded in gettinghold of Menzies who knew of the existence ofthe memo but had never been asked to put for-ward criticism or been told that the matterwas under discussion by the Cabinet. Sincehe and ourselves were the two people vitallyconcerned this seemed to say the least aLittle curious. We eucceeded in getting out aranswer by midnight, which was roughly on thefollowing lines:The question of reporting on ssubmarine activi-ties and setting up a secret organisation forthis purpose might vitally affeat the existingrelations between MI5 and the Eire MinistryCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18577of Defence. It could be done but would takeat least two months and a considerably longerperiod if it were to be really effective.It would moreover necessitate the establish-ment of secret wireless stations for communi-cating with the Admiralty It seemed highlyprobably that the existence of the organisa-tion would in some way come to the notice ofthe Eire authorities and that the service theywere now rendering tOMIS would cease in conse-quence. It was therefore recommended thatbefore any drastic step was taken MI5 shouldget Col.Archer to come over and discuss withhim the possibility of improving the coastwatching service.NOVEMBER 23rdWe have got an 18b order against a S.Africannamed SCHLOSS who gave an unsatisfactoryaccount of himself when he arrived here fromCopenhagen. He is of German origin and hadlived the greater part of his life in Germany.He was moreover equipped with a great dealof photographic apparatus. He said that it washis intention to proceed to S.Africa. Thecase was thin from an H.0. point of view butKendal succeeded in persuading Holdernessthat an 18b order should be issued pendingfurther enquiries.Special material shows that on the llth NOv.instruction were given for the transfer by KLAof 23 tons of bonds from Amsterdam to theDutch Bank in London. It was of course atthis moment that the fear of German invasionwas at its height. The British Govt. made adeclaration last night that we intend tohold up any ship exporting German goods andtake them as contraband. The Belgian Govt.have been informed that we cannot sell Spit-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/18578fires or Hurricanes but that the position isbeing urgently examined as to what supportexisting British Fighter Squadrons couldgive to the Belgian Forces in the event Ofa German attack.I attended a meeting at the H.O. in the after-noon to discuss the question of the exportof newspapers and other printed matter and thegranting of permits for this purpose. Thematter had been brought to a head by the F.O.who were disturbed by the fact that the D.W.Action and other publications which would Canilentirely misrepresent the situation in thiscountry were being allowed to be exported andread abroad. H.L. Farquhar, who representethe F.O., said he was speaking on behalf ofMr.Butler. He was extremely anxious thatsomething should be done. Walt er Monckton wasanxious that we should be quite sure that anymeasures we took were. 98% effective, sinceit was not worth having a political battle onthe home front about this question unless wewere going to achieve results. He had in mindthe possibility of the export of literatureof this kind to Eire and its re-export tothe continent. Also the possibility of sendingindividual copies through the mails which mightnot be detected. Maxwell disliked the ideaf interfering in any way with the existingsystem and pleaded that by the suppression ofminority literature here we weakened the casefor which we were fighting, namely, the libertyof minorities aborad. This seems to indicatea complete misconeeption of the whole position.What we are really fighting for is our ownexistence and in the 2nd place for the princi-ples for which we stand. Maxwell thought thatliterature of this kind might have an effecton ignorant native populations, but that itwould not have much effect on educated Euro-Gatalogue Reference:KV/4/18519This again seems an erroneous theory sinceonly Europeans who have lived here for someconsiderable time can possibly understand thatpublications like the D.W. and Action do notreally cut much ice.Needless to say no conclusions were reachedand a further meeting is to be held.NOVEMBER 24thI had a talk with Bacon about permits forenemy aliens to export goods without serutiny.He said that he had attended a meeting on thissubject and that it had been decided thatafter an enemy alien had passed the tribunal aand M.I.5 had nothing against him, he shouldbe given facilities but that periodicallyscrutniy should take place. My own view isthat no such permit should be given without100% scrutiny.Commissions in the army are being given to enemaliensdoctors ete. SO we are now in a positionwhere a British private soldier has to salutean enemy alien officer. Enemy aliens are alsobeing enlisted in the forces and if they SOdesire they can go into the firing line.Experience in the last war wa s that they eitherdeserted or refused to shoot down theircompatriots. It ended by their being senthome and the formation of the Kaiseris Own.C.C.S are losing some of their detectives whoare being called up for army service.

It snproposed toapply for a Deportation Order and then tosearch the man's private premises.

In England the danger is one of sab-otage and espionage whilst in India it liesin enemy aliens making contacts with subver-sive elements in the population and fomeniwidespread internal unrest.
