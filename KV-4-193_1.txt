I told him that most of his recom-mendations had already been incorporated inour plans for the Seconf Front. Others didnot seem to me to be of general application.He had made certain rather positive criticismsof the Admiralty. I thought that it might beyolitic for him to go over and see ADNI ratherthan send him a copy of the memo. He couldthen explain that we were sending out an SCOto Horta. As regards the other material inthe report he would draft out notes for thedepts. concerned which while giving all thefacts would not be in any way offensive.It has been decided to prosecute JOB and toclose down the transmitter and Dragonfly. Theprinciple reasons are that JOB'S method ofcommunication,namel to people in interneecamps, is to be discouraged since the censor-ship are unable to cope with the large numberof mails. At present they only test a smallpercentage. We could never trust JOB norcould we, in view of what has happened, everise Dragonfly for deception. Informationjust received indicates that JOB had beenpreviously trained.a an Einz T/L agent.This he had not disclosed to us.I lunched with Sclater and weydiscussed Frost'sdeparture and the future of Barnet.

You areking me whether I think that the soldiersand sailors will run away and the minersome out on strike unless Mr.Morrison resigns.To put it more briefly, you are asking mewhether I am a damned fool or not. I replythat it is not for me to say."Miss Ry an then asked whether Shaw thought ittoo strong to say that the Home Secretary'sdecision, whe'ther taken individually or inconcert with others, was calculated to causealarm and despondency among the masses ofthe people who responded to his exhortetionto "go to it". Shaw replied: "I do not thinkit is a strong proposition at all. It makesme suspect that you are mentally deficient.Tthink this MOSLEY panic shameful. Whatart of people are they to can be frightenedout of their wits by a single man like OswaldMOSLEY or Rudolf HESS? They are fit subjectsfor the derision of Goebbels.

But even if MOSLEY were inrude health it was high time to release him,with apologies for having let him frightenus into scrapping the habeas corpus actbecause we dared not bring him to trial".The past part of this remark is not of cou levery sound.December 2ndThe D.G. held a meeting to discuss the finaldraft by the Services recommending Securitymeasures for OVERLORD. The only controversalissue seems to be the 15-mile belt. The argume-ments in favour of this are that the experienceof the past has shown that it is difficult tocontrol the regulated area within the 15-milebelt if visitors are allowed. It means furtherthat when the regulated area is treated thefact becomes broadcast since visitors fromother parts of the country have. to be toldthrough the Press that they cannot to thesplaces. This may pin-point concentrationareas etc. There is of course a possibilitthat the south coast areas nay,prior tooperations, become a serious target for enemyaircraft. Tt is therefore desirable thaa 15-mile belt should be as thinly populatedwith civilians as possible. Necessary addo-mmodation for troops is another aafgument.I had lunch with Peter Loxley.

Heis ho ever particularly anxious to prevent theGermans from getting the impression thatDragonfly was a D.A. since this might causethem to review their other cases. Theproposal is therefore that JOB should: beprosecuted nd that Dragonfly should simplycease to transmit. The Germans will thenbe lef't guessing as to his fate.

The GermansO however get a certain amount of informationfrom Col.Solberg, the American M.A. M. whoseindiscretions are well knon to us.I had a long discussion with Joe Archer,Burtand TAK about the MAF case. Fish in the courseof his epquiries has ascertained that theparticular piece of information about thewas speed,o the Spitfire 21 hat a given heightofficially only in possession of 9 few peop-le, one of whom was almost undoubtedly Father.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193roHe was a test pilot at Worthy Down when thetrials were taking place. The trials beganon May 7th but the prototype crashed on May15th. Sometime between those dates theinformation first became av ilable. It isunlikely that it was computed, since the speedobtained was some 40 mph faster than any ofthe engine experts expected. The documentin which it appeared was compiled up to Junelst. Leakage therefore must have takenplace at some date between 7th-15th May andlst June. This gives roughly a period of 3weeks. The test pilot was a man called Quill.He says however that Father was constantlyin and out of his office with other testpilots and that the results of the test wouldalmost certainly have been known to him and alsto others engaged on similar work. He saysmoreover that before he left Father made astatement when in his cups that he had formerlyworked for the German S.S. This matter h adnever been previously reported to us, andneed not necessarily denote anything more thanan indiscretion. In fact it might be arguedthat if he was in fact working for the GermanS.S. it would have been an xtremely stupidthing to say. The result of the test of coursewas passed on to other peqle and though highlysecret it probably was like ISOS known to agood many. It did not however reach MAP inprint until May 27th which would only haveleft 4 days to get to Berlin.y The suggestionhas been made that possibly Father may have add-ed something to one of his secret ink letterswithout our knowledge. This could not be SOsince clearly these letters are closely super-Catalogue vised. Reference:KV14/19 The next is whether theUletter could have reached the Germans in time.It normally takes some 4 weeks for a letterto reach Father's control station in Barcelona.There is also the possibility that if Harmerhad communicated to Father that the Germanswere not altogether satisfied with hisinformation he might have wished to enhancehis reputation with them on account of his wilewho is resident in Belgium. He might alsoave been rather piqued at being sent to India.If Father has really been playing a doublegame it is rather remarkable that we have notseen any traces of it on ISOS. The wholematter is being gone into very carefully byHarmer and Fish. Personally I am scepticalabout the information having leaked throughFather, but one never knows. I think isis more likely to have gone through anair attache to Stockholm or Madrid, since whatpasses by these routes is only occasionallyknown to us. L am quite sure too that ifthe Spitfire 21 had exceeded all computationsby 40 mph the fact must have been known toa large number of people who would have beenprepared to dine out on the information.December 3rdThurston came to see me about the BEDAUX case.He told me that he had seen Elkington and takentwo statements from him which he had sent onto Washington. He had also had' a look at king-ton's files. He was quite certain thatneither Elkington nor the Anglo-Iranian wereCatalogue Reference:KVI4/193a party to BEDAUX'S visit to Berlin in Oct.41.Elkington had known BEDAUX intimately for along time and was in fact at Abadan whenBEDAUX was there before the war. BEDAUXrationalised the whole method of peoductionaccording to his own system, and was thereforein possession of full details about the wholeplant. Before the war BEDAUX was playingpolitics with the Persian Govt. in connectionwith Anglo-Iranian. He caused a consider-able amount of trouble and had to be toldquite defi itely that he had no authority torepresent Anglo-Iranian with the Persianauthorities in any discussions. Thurston saidthat he did not know at the moment whetherBEDAUX was in the custody of the FBI or G2 oreven where he was. The FBI had sent acouple of chaps to N.Africa to interrogateBEDAUX but in his view it was not possibleto stage anything in the nature of a prosecu-tion for treachery or espionage, since BEDAUXhad covered himself by reporting frequentlyot Bullitt, ,Murphy and Mathews at Vichy. Iexplained to Thurston that our interest inthe case was to some extent academic butthat we should like to tie up any tag endsand get as clear a view as possible as to theextent to which the BEDAUX network had beenused as a medium for espionage. Thurstonsuggested that we should send out a brief toMills and that Mills could go down and examinethe Bureau's files. I told Tharston aboutMULLER'S mission to Persia in the early autumnof 42 which I thought might well have beenbased on information supplied by BEDAUX. Ihave asked Kellar to send a wire out to MidEast to get MULLER interrogated on this point.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/1933It is possible too that MULLER may know some-thing about Bensmann of Ast Benen who was pre-sent at the meeting, and of Prof.Endrou.AMGOT is now known as Amgotterdammerung, or"The Twilight of the Rods!.I had a long talk with TAR about the MAP caseand Father. I think we can fairly confidentlyliminate the possibility of Father havingreported the performance of the Spitfire at theend of one of his letters. There is only oneor at the outside two letters which are in Dany way material to the investigation. Inboth these cases we have seen the contents ofthe letter go right through to Berlin. Thefull text is there without anyaddition. Theonly other passibility is that Father may haveanother link and that he is corresponding toanotheraddress. This seems equally unlikelysince as his information was regarded as ofconsiderable mportance it is almost incon-ceivable that we should not have seen somereflection of his alternative method on ISOS.Fish is of course hopping with excitement andit is very difficult to damp his ardourwithout telling him the full facts. TAR hashowever gone So far as to tell him bhat wehave positive information that the communica-tions Father sent at the materi 1 time reachedthe Germans in terms identical with thosedespatched from here and without any additions.Person ily L think that fish and Jo Archer aresflyhpinforitatioHc and on the the imeegd circulation. secrecyCatalogue Reference:KVI4/193wuI shall not be at all surprised if it were foundthat a large number of Spitfire pilots andpossibly also Coast il Command pilots who areoperating on the aerodrome at Worthy Down gadnot been acquainted with the remarkable per-formance of the Spitfire 21, which did roughly450 mph at about 24,000 ft.Pandora shows that the -rish have alreadywarned HEMPEL that they may be recalling allwireless sets. This has probably come about-from a conversation which Cecil had the otherday with McKenna, the Irish Chief of Staff. Mc.Kenna asked him what we were really anxiousabout. Cecil said that in connection with theSecond Front we were clearly concerned aboutleakage of information which might take placeby wirelessfrom the German Legation and siadthat possibly some demarche might be made inthis connection. McKenna was very sympathetic.The probability is that he reported the matterand that Dev. thought it better to take actionbefore receiving a peremptory request. TheGermans have no alternative method of communi-cation except cable and are wondering whetherit would be possible to get wireless partsby submarine. Theywill be left without areceiving set as well as withouta transmitteras their set is both.When the Armistice with Itaiy was announcedthe German sabotage Service at Madrid began toinvestigate the possibilities of preventingItalian merchant ships in Spanish ports fromfalling into British hands. Some of theseships opened the sea-cocks, but it was thoughtCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19315advisable to attach bombs to others. 'Thiswas done at Cadiz and attempts were also madeat Huelva and Cartegna. An attempt to sabot-age the British S.S. Greathope at Huelva wasprevented by a member of our counter-sabotagesquad operating under water. On 14th No.he found a object wired to the ship's rudderwhich was detached by divers and fell to thebottom of the harbour. A certain San Felicetho seems to have been a member of the italianSecret Service, is now collaborating to someextent with the Allies in the Mid East. Hehas told us that the attempts against theKaituna, the Fernplant and the Scilian Princesome weeks ago were made by Italian Navalexperts operating from the Turkish mainland.According to him, the Naval experts returnedto Italy 5 months ago taking all their stocksof sabotage materia. with them. He does notthink that any further attempts will be madefrom the Turkish mainland. He disclosedthat information about our counter-sabotagemeasures had been ob tained from somebodyconnected with bloyds agency. This man isprobably an extremely undesirable person<nown as RICKARDS. for some reason or otherSan Felice has not been pressed to disclosethe exact source of his information. Thispoint is being taken up.Important information about intended sabotageactivities of the German SS in vitaly has recent-ly been received. Requests are made by theGerman sabotage service for large quantities ofequipment most of which is SOu material. Hill-Dillon has been warned.

Meanwhile we thinkthat we have discovered a method of neutral-ising the bomb which SOE had not thought of.December 4thSo far as can be judged the affairs of Tricycleand Artist in the Iberian Peninsula are goingwell and the traffic which Tricycle took overwith him has been well judged in Berlin whohave given their consent to a large moneyadvance being made.Dragonfly has succeeded in re-establishingcontact with the Germans, although no trafficof any importance has been exchanged. Inview of the unfortunate developments in theJOB case it has been deemed advisable thatDragonfly should not again transmit, in thehopes that the Germans will conclude thathe has been identified and arrested. We par-ticularly do not wish them orthink he has beena D.A as this might cause them to reviewother traffic.A position which may be serious has arisendue to a possible Leakage from the interneeCatalogue Reference:KVf17camp in which JEFF was originally detained,namely Camp WX. There was apparently communi-cation between Camp WX and another adjacentinternment camp from which certain indivisualswere returned to Germany on an exchangebasis.

We can now get down tothe reorganisation of Barnet.An F.O. report dated 22.11.43 on Morale inGermany sums up the present position as follows:Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1931"Though no doubt discussions of such projectscontinue in military and concervative circles,there is no report of any atempt yet on thepart of the military leaders orindustrialiststo overthrow the Nazi regime. There have infact been no signs of active opposition inany quarter. Nevertheless awareness ofimpending defeat has grown and readiness toaccept it. The prestige of Hitler hasfallen yet further. Even Party circlesshare these feelings and over the whole fieldof administra tion the effective controlexercised by the authorities is slackening.There is severe strain, apathy and indifferncewhich tends to cause all work to lessen andlower production, and increase the tendencymentioned in the last report to give personalsafety and private interest precedence overthe needs of the war effort. Morale in thearmed forces seems considerably higher than athome. If it were not, it is hard to see howthe German Army would continue to fight SOwell. But here too there have been signs ofsagging and reports speak of a slackening ofdiscipline during the retreat in the Wast.There is evidence of considerable depressioramong the forces of occupation, particularlyin Norway, while the possibility of the contagiof low morale at home spreading to the fightingservices appears to be causing anxiety to theauthorityes.

He made contadt with the Britishand American banking organisations to whom hemade an armistice peace proposal. The sugges-Catalogue Reference:k4/23tion was that we and the Americans shouldoccupy Germany and that meanwhile a frontwould be held against the Russians. Schachtsaid that he was speaking in the name of theindustrialists and the Generals who were con-vinced that the war was lost. His proposalswere rejected, in London and Nashington.It is understood that similar proposals havebeen made in Lisbon which have also beenturned down.I held a meeting with Baxter,Milmo and JockWhyte about escapers and evaders. It wasdecided that Milmo would draw up a memo fordiscusslon with MI9 in which the dangers ofthe situation both f rom our point of viewand the MI9 point of view would be made clearwith certain specific examples. We would thensuggest that at any rate in the case of alliednationals who had taken more than a monthto get through the period at the MI9 campshould be extended to a week; in order to copewith the situation we Nould try and providea French-speaking officer who would be attachedto the LRC and thoroughly conversant withthe index. He would be available to takeinterrogations when required.At the D.G.S meeting today L raised the case ofKERN, the undesirable b anker who, backed bythe Treasury, had succeeded in getting an exitvisa for the USA. it seemed to me undesirablethat ane should pass on information to thedetriment of an individual who was backed byCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1931uan official Govt.dept. What had been wrongin this case was thatthe Treasury hadbackedthe visa before consulting us. The matteris to be raised on the Travel Control CommitteeAs regards the ltalian P/W who are now to beabsorbed into industry, it was decided thatwe should inform D.P.W. that it would beundesirable to employ these people inregulated areas.TAR and L went to Barnet this afternoon.Wediscussed first of all the future of the wire-less experts. It seemed to me th they mightbe useful on 2nd Front operations. I haveasked Sclater to get out a memo explainingexactly what takes place when a W/T is reportedeither by .Hing or by informant. it seemedto me that precisely the same situation wouldarise within the zone of the armies and yome-body would be required to conduct the hunt,the primary purpose of which would be to gethold of the agent and turn him round. Whenwe got the paper on this subject Dick shouldtakeeit up with CUSSAC. TAR is going tospend some time at Barnet and will firstof all go into the whole question ofpolicy. I have impressed upon him that beforefalling into the arms of Maltby and G.P. itwould be as well to acquaint himself thoroughlyith the constitutional position. At themoment R.S.S.'s view on this matter are farfrom satisfactory. although they were respon-sible to us as well as to S. IS. theywere quite capable of taking away transmitterswhich should be used for our purposes andusing them to carry out jobs for other depts.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19326We hav no idea how the resources of R.S.S. areallocated. For instance we are never informedas to the extent to which transmitters arebeing used for the purpose of general search.G.P I think takes the line that although hemay have a vague responsibility towards uisfor what happens in this country, we are inno way concerned in what he does abroad. Onthis basis he failed to consult us beforesending a van to the Azores. Had there beensome sort of consultation the whole operationmight have been carried out better than itwas. The probability is that the van oughtnever to have been sent at all.December 8thAt the Wednesday meeting the case of "Bastler"was mentioned. After observation by D.6and careful enquiry at the LRC the conclusionhas been reached that de GONDRA is not theman concerned. Personally I am not entirelyconvinced although L have not seen the detailedevicence. I have asked Kellar and Burne,a propos of the Rickards case, to make somenquiry about the duties of Lloyds represen-atives abroad and the extent to which theyare informed of our shipping movements.TAR is rather worried about the position of hisD.A.S. Owing to the intervention of Artistthe whole Tricycle set-up might collapse, atany moment, and cannot at any rate be usedfor deception purposes. Artist has also heardabout Plan Dream which brings him perilouslynear to Garbo. Mean hiee it has been decidedCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193yascertained that for a good may monthscommunication by signalling has been going onbetween Camp WX and the adjacent Nazi intern-ment camp. Sometimes this signalling tookthe form of throwing a brick with a messageon it. It seems also that broadcast programmeswere made in both camps which were linkedto the same receiver. This means that aperson in one camp could by speaking intothe microphone employed be able to be heardin the othercamp. H number of prisoners havebeen questioned as to their knowledge aboutthe inmates of Camp NX. As a result we haveascertained that the presence there of Jeffand Summer was knon to the Nazi Camp andin particular to a man called KARL who wasallowed to go back to Germany a short timeago on an exchange basis. this may meanthat Tate is blown and also Mutt. Karlwas doubtless vetted on his record but not onthe fact that he had been in close proximityto Camp WX.Dragonfly has had to be liquidated. Thisleaves us with rather a motley crew, sinceeven Lipstick who is an a very strong posit,is probably known to Artist. Sniper and Filand Bronx appear to be secure but the firsttwo have not yet really got going. Treasureis also all right but not really in actionand has no wireless set.I understand that the German bombing raid onBari was rather a disastrous affair for us.Some 12 ammunition ships were blown up.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19327Lipstick arrived back the other day with largequantities of duff on his tie.I went over to see C. this afternoon. I toldhim that we had recently been asked by Dr.-Vick of the Industrial research Dept. of theMinistry of Supply for our opinion on thepossible Leakage of information from factorieswhich were concerned with the production ofnfra-red apparatus. Vick's view.wa that SOach depended on the surprise element that ifthere were any grounds for thinking thatserious leakage had occurred it might alterthe course of operations. David's view isthat in SO far as factories are concernedthe risk is very small. It does appear howeverthat infra-red was used by the one-man submarinin their attack on the lirpitz some weeks agoand that the Germans may possible have cap-tured a torpedo intact, although insofar asinfra-red is concerned there was a self-destroy-ing gadget. Infra-red was also used onthe beaches at Salerno in some form or anotherand on a ship which was sunk in the Mediterran-ean. I told C. that we were going throughour agents' traffic but I thought that therelight have been some reference to the subjecton M.S.S. He said he thought that possiblythere were references. He would find outand let me know. I told him that Dr. Vickwas submitting a report to the X. committee,whatever that might be. U. thought he hadheard of it but did not know what it did.I then told C. about Miss Nunn and asked himwhether he would have any objection to her see-Oaalogute Referendeakvt4/gaI explained thepurpose of her appointment and that much ofthe advantages of it would be lost if wewere forced to withhold certain informtionf'rom her. If we could persuade her that thisdept. and others were doing useful work it-might be helpful both to ourselves and to SIS.C. agreed to Miss Nunn seeing this material,and suggested that she might be told,by wayof a caution, that C. was personally responsibleto the P.M. for the material and that hername had therefore been placed on the P.M.&S "slist.I told C. about OSS's curious action in thePeninsula when they had returned one ofAspirin's letters to his cover address to theFBI stating that they thought it denoted thepresence of an agent in the USA. It hadoccurred to me as possible that OSS might beworking on the basis of the Censorship WatchList and that this might be Hoover's reasonfor not wishing to pass secret addresses tothe Censorship. C. thought this was quiteprobable; although he did not see what hecould do he thought it would be as well tobear the possibility in mind that OSSmight be carrying out CE activities in thePeninsula by putting agents in on coveraddresses. they were quite capable of doingthis kind of thing without reference to anyone.C. told me that French Intelligence was inanappalling mess. He had had a pathetic letterfrom Rivet, about some sort of politicaldefence committee which was now responsibleand of course knew nothing about the job.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19329Rivet's own position is very shaky and Paillolstill more SO. Passy has taken over. IfPaillol goes he will probably apply for theservices of Bonnefusse. C. is just waitingto see what happens, but if he is not satis-fied when the F'rench have sorted out their aff-airs he may refuse to co-operate with inexper-ienced politicians. This would mean thesolation of French Intelligence in thiscountry which would be quite a serious matter.C. thought that, unfortunate as the remark was,Smuts was quite right when he said that theF'rench were finished as a nation and obviouslysunk to the lowest depths.I asked C. if he had heard anything about anyapproach by any European countries toccomewithin the British Commonwealth as foreshad-owed by Smuts in his speech. He said he hadheard of representations by Hungary andtoumania but not by any other countries.We then got on to the rocket-gun and theQueen Bee. C. is quite certain that thelatter will be used, though opinions varyso some extent as to the date. From a verygood source he has heard that it would probablynot be a going concern before March or April,whilst from other sources the indications arethat it might start in January. There areanything up to 100 of what areyknown as "ski-sutes" which are for the purpose of catapultingthese airdraft into the air. They are saidto have a speed of about 400 mph and carry aload of 2 tons of explosive. The sites appearCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19330to be directed towards London, Southampton andBristol. They are more or less identical indesign with the sites already photographed:at PPeenemunde It is thought that the recentdropping of flares over London, remaining inthe air for anything upto 3/4 of an hour,might have something to do with the guidingof the Queen Bee on to its target. Instructionshave now been issued to Air Force pilots tohelp them in coping with this type ofaircraft and also the ski-sites. bombing ofthe sites has already begun but I do not thinkthat up to the present it has been particularlysuccessful. U. thinks that there may be arocket-gun. T'here is apparently a largeemplacement at Watten which may be for thepurpose of launching a rocket but he israther inclined to think that too extravagantclaims have been made for it and that it hasbeen exploited by the Germans more as propagandthan anythingelse, in order to cover up theQueen Bee.I asked C. whether Overlord was likely to beadvanced in consequence. He said that thiswas the subject of discussion at the momentin Africa but that SO far he had heardnothing. He thought that Turkey was probablygoing to give us bases. It would doubtfulwhether they would come in as co-belligerents.C. then told me that he had heard from certainwell-placed quarters that Scotland Yard tooka very poor view of MI5. I said that this washighly probable for three reasons, firstlybecause the Yard had not the slightest ideacatalogue "Reference:K8n4/193ly Reference K occasionally got31some rather trivial enquiry to investigate.Doubtless they judged the general standard ofour work by these enquiries, which might onlybe the ty ing up of a few tag ends, but appearedrather futile. The second reason was theSTOCKMAN case, which could not have made usvery popular in high quarters since it dis-closed the fact that at least a dozen police-men were deeply involved in corruption. Thisknowledge ofsthe unreliability of the policewas of course a limiting factor on the amountof information that we gave them. Lastlythere wes the presence here of Burt and hisofficers, who had always been rather a sorepoint with S.B. The latter thought thatenquiries made by Burt and his men shouldreally be made by the Yard. C. said hewas very glad to know these things since infuture he would be able to put a stop to anysuch stories.December 9thDick and I had dinner with Whitefoord at the"ravellers last night when the plan for lateverlord was explained and apparently metwith full approval. We tackled the questionof Percy. Jock Whitefoord replied that whilehe very much sympathised he thought that wemight do a lot worse. He aid there was alreada tendency in Etousa to say that the Britishin Cossac were over-loaded. If therefore weput in a British officer over Percy, thesupreme commander when he took office mighttake exception to this and impose on us someCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19317frightful American who knew nothing aboutanything, when we should have to begin allover again. In other words we might wellbe out of the fryingpan into the fire. InPercy we had at least somebody who was manage-able although at times he might be trying.He had a great respect for Dick and for theway he had handled the whole problem. Ifthings really got difficult Whitefoord himse Lfwas ready to take a hand, and Dick could hataccess to him whenever he wanted. L am sorryfor Dick but L think that Jock Whitefoord isright and that we should make the best ofPercy. Meanwhile Providence is on our sidewith regard to Col.Blakeney whose services havebeen urgently called for by some other dept.His place will be taken shortly by MacLeod.I had a talk with Burt. I mentioned thatinformation had reached me from a high quarterthat the Yard took a very poor view of thisoffice. I asked Burt whether he thought thatwas true and whether the reasons were aspreviously stated by men He said that he hadgained a similar impression but that he hadnever lost an opportunity of expressing acontrary view. He said the criticisms werenearly all based on ignorance. If he wereexpressing a criticism himself the only thingsthat he would say would be that there werea certain number of cases that might be moreeasily cleared up by direct enquiry insteadof beating about the bush with HOWs etc. withthis I heartily agreed. He thought too that onoccasions there was a tendency to accept reportsCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1933of a rather vague kind and act on them. Withthis I also agreed. Apart from these twopointshe had a very high opinion of the ork donehere. L think he is anxious to stay on afterthe war.Jock Whitefoord rang me up this morning to saythat he had very much enjoyed our meeting lastnight and that he had already discussed postOverlord with Percy. Percy had drawn histtention to certain F.O. telegrams to Washing-con on the subject of a United NationsSecuriy Organisation. He thought this might besome appalling crea ion of Bill Donovan's.I said that I had heard nothing about it but ththat I would find out from the F.O.,since itmight run counter to our on plans.Joe Stephenson has telegraphed from Cairoto say that Polish N/T transmitters are asplentiful as tabby-cats in the Middle East andare causing great anxiety. These are of coursethe Polish secret service communications forwhich V. is responsible He told the meetingt t Kinnaird House in September that hehad nocontrol over them and that tney were notonitored or broken. He thought however thatif there was anything going wrong there wouldbe some reflection on other sources. Thisseemed to me to be a very doubtful argument.The secret service communications of/alliedgovts. are supposed to be passed through SIschannels and to be vetted. it would however beinteresting to know how this works in practice.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19334December lOthI had a talk with Baxter about hiscutting downenquiries to B.lReg. He think that thiscould be considerably reducedwithout any realdanger. To this I have agreed. We thendiscussed registries in a general way. Isaid that I felt it was a pity that our ownmain registry and possibly also B. IReg.was not designed on lines somewhat similarto the Information Index. I felt that thiscould only be done by someone who reallyunderstood the intelligence problem. Forexample, the LRC might get information that awaiter in a cafe opposite the station atPerpignan was probably a German agent. Ifthere had been any information on this subjectbefore, the general registry would have nomeans of picking it up. The Information Indexcould merely turn up the card for Perpignanand get it. Equally B.1 might ask forgraces for all agents coming here withsimilar assignments, e.g. flying an aircraftback to occupied territory. Owing to theexcellence of their memories they might probab-ly get back on this information but ifsomeone new had to come in and take overthe section, we might not be able to getat it. I have always had in mind a smallintelligence staff in our gener 1 registry andI still think that considerable advantagemight be derived from such an arrangement, sincthere are opportunities for seeing thingsand co-ordinating generally that do not occurin any other part of the office.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19335Jock Whyte came to tell me that STYLES, theP/W who had been acting as a stoolpigeonfor the Germans and had miraculously escapedto Stockholm, has now disappeared. He tele-phoned to the Embassy saying that he has goneback to Germany in the hopes of getting outone of his comrades. There is little doubtthat he got cold feet about coming back tothis country. Probably someone in Stockholminadvertently roused his suspicions. Mean-while I have told Spooner to take statementsfrom all those who have any information togive about STYLES SO that we shall beready to receive him if and when he turns up.RUSER, who has gone to Camp 020, has told usthat he was given a promise by the Asst.M A.in Madrid that if he came back to this countryhe would be allowed his liberty. He has alsotold us that his mother, who is still in Mad-rid, is known to the Germans, and SO is hisdesertion to the British. Since the Germansare looking for the mother, it has been decddedif possible to get her out since she mightconceivably compromise Artist. Meanwhilewe are trying to find out what promisesvere in fact made to RUSER. This is of coursea matter on Which we should have been informedbefore RUSER came here. Tricicle has got aquestionnaire from the S.D., which is the firstthat we have had from that organisation. Itdeals almost entirely with political matters inthis country. Ian Wilson has returned withquite a lot of interesting information.amongst other things Artist has told him thatCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19336Fremdeheere do not do more that say that areport is reliable or unreliable, onfirmedor unconfirmed; they have no knowledge of theantecedents of the agent. Abt.I do not appearto assess the information. They generallyleave this to Frendeheere, whose comments aresomewhat colourless. In Artist's view Abt.Iwill always be led up the garden till theyhave the antecedents of their agents care-fully vetted by Abt.IIl. Mercifully thereseems very little chance of this coming about.Brooman-White who is trying to make bricksin Section V. without straw, tells me thatthe registrationsystem is terrible. It isapparently the policy to card an individualnot more than once a month. To find anyreports in the intervening period one has tocomb through endless papers.The J.1.C. have put in quite an interestingreport in which they try to review scales ofenemy attack an sea, land and air against cer-tain areas throughout the world. They say thatin view of the steadily deteriorating positioof Germany and Japan and the probable devebr-opment of allied strategy, it is unlikely thatany future revision of these estimates will beon an upward scale. The report indicates thegeneral weakness of the Germn position through-out the Mediterranean area. As regards seacommunications in the North Atlantic, it issaid that the Tirpitz is out of action for aperiod of at least 2 months and cannot be madeoperationally sea-worthy without re-fitting andrepair in a main dockyard. T'he battle-cruiserCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1933Gneisenau has been dismantled. the 8" cruiserHippa is probably out of commission. No workcan be observed on the aircraft carrier GrafZeppelin and there are no indications thatGermany intends to put her into commission.-The effective German main units thereforeare the battle-cruiser Scharnhorst, pocketbattleships Scheer and Lutzow, and 8" cruiserPrince Eugen. The 6" cruisers have not theendurance to operate on trade routes. It isconsidered extremely improbable that with Sofew main units and without an aircraft carrierthe German Navy would risk a fleet action.About 120 German U-boats, of which at the verymost 8o may be at sea at any time, are nowbased on French West coast ports. T'he rate ofU-boat sinkings has been higher, and the rateof entry into operational service lower, thanwas anticipated, but Ne cannot with certaintyassume th t the enemy may not be able tomaintain or slightly increase their presentstrength. In the event of an Allied cross-channel invasion of the Continent Germanymight operate i limited number of U-boats(including 250-ton boats) in the Channel.December l1thAbetz had a conversation with Petain on the4-5th Dec. when he asked for clarification ofPetain's attitude towards Germany. this hadarisen over Petain's suggestionthat the Nation-al Assembly should be re-convened. Abetz saidthat in no circumstances could Germany considerthenre-convening of an Assembl which had hadthe effrontery to declare war on Germany. SuchCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1933%6a step would take at least 2-3 months,du duringwhich period France would be without a Govt.England and America might well take thisopportunity for opening the Second Front.There is apparently some suggestion that anattempt may be made to assassinate Petainjust before Anglo-American landing operationsbegin. The Marshal was threatened withthe possibility of Germany taking oMer thewhole of the Govt. if he did not drop hisroposal to convene the National Assembly.Petain has therefore found himself obligedto conform to the wishes of the GermansLaval has been warned that he must strengthenhis Cabinet by the inclusion of members ofother collaborationist parties as well ashis own.A telegram has been received from S.I.S.at Lourenco Marques about a plot to assassinateSmuts. The idea is to substitute his pilotfor a representative of the Broderbond.telegram has already been to Mid East, andPretoria. We have informed Nairobi, DaressalemBulawayo, Lukasa and Kampala. Antony hasbeen over to nformeStephenson at the D.O.who did not seem very excited. Smuts isat the moment in Cairo.Lipstick in addition to bringing 9 duffs onhis tie, which contain an elaborate question-naire, brought escudos tothe value to E1380.His visit has been very satisfactory. Thequestions are mainly of a technical characterrelating to various forms of RDF and rocketpropulsion. In Madrid he was asked to submitCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19339a report on the concrete runway at SuttonCommon, an aerial photograph of which hadbeen taken and a copy of which was shown tohim. It was suggested that the runway mightbe an underground hanger. It was also sugges-ted to Lipstick that he should take a courseof lectures in yrotechnics as the Germans werevery anxious to have information regardingour latest develppments in this science. Theenemy appear to be taking a much greaterinterest in the messages Tate is sending andare asking a number of questions in extensionof the information which is sent over. thismay indicate increased confidence or thatspecial tests as to his reliability are beingcarried out in the light of informationsupplied by Karl who was in touch with CampWX and may have reported on the possibilitiesof Tate being blown.The B.B.C. have put tp a suggestion that theGerman wives of certain personnel in theiremploy and other Germans known to them shouldbe allowed to send a broadcast message totheir relatives at Xmas, without submitting tothe usual practice of a 14 days delay, which1S the rule for communications by alliednationals totheir relatives in occupied terri-tory. We are objecting to the proposal sincealthough security grounds are somewhat flimsyit seems undesirable that Germans in thiscountry should communicate by broadcast totheir relations in Germany who may well beNazis. On general political grounds Xmasfraternisation would seem to be a mistake atthis moment.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193noShelford and I went over to see Vincent Masseyabout the case of SEMPILL. I gave a briefoutline of SEMPILL'S record and explained thatI did not think we had sufficient informationon security grounds to refuse him an exitpermit, particularly sincethe case had alreadybee backed by the Canadian Army authorities.Vincent Massey got on to a member of his staffand ascertained that the suggestion forSEMPILL'S visit to Canada had arisenthrough his connection with the Catholicwelfare organisation known as the Knights ofSt.Columbus, of which he was President in thiscountry, and MAr. Slade, the Canadian represen-tative of the organisation here had dtainedthe backing of the Army. I explained toMassey that SEMPILL'S case might be summarisedby saying that his primary interest was inhis own pocket. He would not have directdealings with the enemy but if there wasa change of doing a deal and the divulging ofconfidential information might assist innegotiations he would have no scruples. Apartfrom this he was notoriously indiscreet, andhad recently blotted his copybook at theAnglo-Swedish luncheon when he had supporte(wady peace. Snowden Massey in said her he views knew about SEMPILL, a negotiated who wasan ardent Catholic. Had he been consultedin the first instance about the exit permithe would undoubtedly have done all he couldto prevent the matter going forward,since inhis view SEMP ILL was not the kind of personwho was likely to improve Anglo-anadianrelations. He might easily say something stupidHe thought SEMPILL was unbalanced. In theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193utcircumstan tances however he did not think thatit was possible no to intervene. He thoughtit better that SEMPILL should be allowed to goand that the Canadian police should not beinformed. L have suggested to the DG. that we.should write a private letter to Millsgiving him a general outline of SEMPILL'Scase and telling him to keep the ma tter tohimself unless he was consulted by the RCMPr the military authorities or unless he sawSEMPILL committing indiscretions or poking hisnose into matters which were not his concern.Jock Whyte came to see me in rather a stateabout the work of his section. He said thatthere were SO many P/WNs arriving that he couldnot really cope with them all. I told himthat L had instructed B.5 to take statementsin the STYLES case. I thought this was workthat they should properly do and that insteadof travelling about himself he should allowthem to collect the statements which might bethe basis of evidence in proceedings againstP/Ws who had acted as stool-pigeons in DritishP/W Camps in Germany.Kim Philby came to see me. He had furtherinformation about the plot to assassinateSmuts. There is now some suggestion of arevolutionary movement by the Broderbond. Kimis rather sceptical about the information whichcomes to SIS 3rd hand, the intermediary beinga prostitute.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193uKim seems to think that the I.B.businesswas going fairly well but rather anticipatedmore trouble from Helix. re did not seemaltogether happy about Gwyer's appointment.He thought it would probably work out all rightbitmeondered whether the idea was that Gwyershould have a permanent position at Cossac.Heseemed to think that Gwyer was slightlyover-rated and that he was inclined tospin meetings out unnecessarily. I saidthat I would talk to Lick about this.I do not think that Kim necessarily wantsus to make a change. he is only indicatingthat the appointment if a permanency,mightpossibly lead to difficulties. Felix of coursehates Gwyer. I gather that Dick's meeting withFelix yesterday was a bit sticky.TAR has put forward a somewhat grandiose schemefor running deception in the field. the ideais that he should hold a GSOI appointment atCOSSAC, maintaining liaison with Ops B. I.B.and LCS (Bevan's organisation) At D-30he should send?a GS02,2 GSO3's and 3 officersetc. to 21st Army Group. the GSO2 workingin a sort of capacity to himself at Cossac,i.e. he will come directly under the BGSI andwill work to Ops.B on the one hand and I.B.in the other. T'his scheme gives him virtualcontrol of the running of D.A.S it is there-fore likelyto meet with violent opposition fromFelix.YRupert told me a typical Ned Lutyens joke. Hewas dining at a restaurant and when presentedwith some fish, asked the waiter what it was.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1934 3T'he waiter replied that it was cod. Lutyenssaid "This piece of cod passeth all under-standing".December 12thZigzag has again been referred to on ISOS.He is evidently still in the land of theliving and appears to have another assign-ment abroad. He is to correspond with acover address in Lisbon. His cover lettersare to be on the subject of cork. Thisprobably has some bearing on the affairs ofzum HINGSTE and the LINKE case.December 13thI went over to see Archie Boyle and JohnSenter on the subject of the enquiry by theJIC into SOE. I made it plain to them boththat we had no wish to take part in any indict-ment against SOE. We had been summoned to giveeivdence and we should naturally have to answerany questions that were put to us. In thisconnection I said that Wethered and Victorould be accompanying me to the F.0. BothArchie and John Senter conpletely understoodour position. Boyle tells me that the wholematter had arisen through a complaint byAir Marshall Harris of Bomber Command.Whether he knew that the Dutch organisation nadbeen blown for 2 years I can't say but pre-sumably he did, in which case he would havefelt that his bombers and pilots were beingwasted on useless enterprises, which only hadCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193the effect of supplying the Germans withsabotage material which was ultimately usedag inst us. He had I gather been asked toarrange for some 400 sorties during the nextmoon period, a.nd was probably wondering whetherthey were embarking on an equally uselessenterprise.I raised the question with boyle and Senterof SOE headquarters staff going into thefield. It seemed to me that if they werepeople who had not only fairly complete know-ledge of their own organisation but also ofours, and that of SIS, they might if caughtbe forced to divulge importan f cts. Sentersaid that only in special cases did suchvisits take place and that the officers con-cerned had pr ctically no knowledge of eitherour organisation or that of SIS.I lunched with Jock Whitefoord. He told methat he was having a certain amount of troubleabout the security measures of CUSSAC.A paper had gone up to the Chiefs of Staffbut unfortunately Nye had also raised thequestion of journalists and the D.B.C.This had led the Chiefs of Staff to dem nd apaper emboaying these questions also. White-foord was trying to get the to questions dis-entangled.te then discussed TAR'S deception unit. Imade it clear to Whitefoord that there might bea certain amount of controversy with SIS aboutthe running of XX agents. It seemed to us how-ever that XXs should be run primarily for theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193purpose of deception and thatsince deception wawas mainly an ops matter, TAR'S unit thoughbased administratively on I.B. would have tobe under Ops control. Whitefoord thought thiswas sound but was a little doubtful about thepossibilities of deception in the field.In the early stes of course deception Nouldbe controlled from this country and would bedirected towards persuading the enemy thatother landings are likely to take place.Inthe field it could not really come intooperation until the bridgehead had pushed nellout. "hitefoord seemed to think that it wouldbe extremely difficult either physicall ornotionally to take agents over. I said thatthis was not really so difficult as it seemed.We already had an agent notionally in the I.Corps, and he might conceivably have opportun-ities of using a wireless set. Our experiencewas that the Germans would swallow almost any-thing and we had the inestimable advantageof knowing whether in fact they were doing soor not. Apart from these agents there wouldit was hoped be an opportunity of turning roundsome of those captured in the field. We knewthat it was the intention of the enemy toleave a certain number behind and that thesepeople were already periodically coming up fortesting.Lastly Whitefoord asked me whether it Nould bepossible to let him have certain reports relatinto internal affairs in Germany and particularlythose which gave details about German under-ground organisations. He had apparently, througCharles Peake his political adviser, got a cer-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193utain amount of information derived from ZECH.I told him the history of this individual indthat although his story was a very remarkableone we had after careful sifting come to theconclusion that he was genuine. I could alwaysarrange that information of the kind given byZECH should be tr insmitted to him, if it camefrom our sources. On the other hand I saw aconsiderable number of reports from SIS in whichI thought he might be interested. I couldpass these to him but it would be contraryto the rules. I suggested therefore that hemight apply direct to C. He had 1 think alreadyapproached DMI but the latter had turned himdown, mainly I think on grounds. of security.Obviously he ought to have every thing he wantson the subject on underground movements inGermany. .prints and JIC reports are notmuch use on this subject.I attended an enquiry by Cavendish-Bentinck andCapel-Dunne into SOE'S activities. John Senterand Mockler-Ferry mar were present, and Wetheredand Victor gave evidence. I explained the systerby which we dealt vith accredited and unaceredited agents. Wethered was asked hether anyunaccredited agents had proved to be spies.The answer was that although suspicion hadattached to some of them there was no provencase. Equally there was not proven caseagainst any agent Who had come out and beenreported to us by SOE. There were cases ofagents who had given others away and boughttheir freedom on the grounds that they veregoing to work for the enemy. There was howeverno reason to think that they intended to carryout their assignments. Wethered's evidenceCatalogue Reference:KVI4/19347only took about 5 minutes. Victor then gavehis views. in some detail on the sabotagequestion. He said that the Germans wereusing a considerable amount of our materialin operations against our shipping both atGib., in Spanish ports and in N.Africa.Furthermore there had been recent indicationslarge quantities of SOE material beingent down from Berlin to Rome. it was not alwpossible to say whether this material hadreached the Germans through an SOE agency or tthrough combined operations, or other. paramilitary wits. In some cases however itcould be said, owing to the devices beingreceived back in their original packing, thatthey thexatame taroughy y8hyS@Ftesenenfsrnalistoabbaint SOE Listoabsaintet/compromised SOE camouflage material, whichon occasions might be rather. more difficult todeal with. Mockler-Eerryan said. that suchequipment was not likely to be dumped in largequantities. It would probably be taken overon special exeditions, and although the Germanmight have a few samples they probably wouldnot have sufficient quantities to distributetheir sabotage agents in various parts-ofthe world. The new booby trap clamp wasexplained and it was pointe out that devicesof this kind caused us considerable anxietysince it weald obviously hamper the operationsof our under-water divers. Victor said thatalthough we knew of a dump in Berlin andalsoat an Abt.. 11 training centre in France, it wasimpossible for us to estimate the quantities OJSOE material at present in enemy hands or theGalgyeabeeferengeekidaat93amounts dropped thatwent astray.HIS IS A COPYudACT 3 IN (4) DEPARTMENT OF 1958.

The question ofIrish labour is also to.be discussed. It seemsalmost impossible to keep Irishmen out the15-mile belt. Many of them are employed thereat the present time and of course go back tlreland on leave once every 6 months.A report has come in from the officer who con-ducted CERVELL, Swedish MA, CARLBOM, Asst. AirAttache, and Prince Bertil on a visit to theBristol aircraft factiry. They had lunch withthe chief engineer, tea with the test pilotand spent-the evening at the guest house withthe chiefdesigner. lt is not surprising there-fore that CERVELL has been able to inform hisCatalogue Reference.KVI4/193 Reference:49Govt. about the programme, prospects and futuredesigns of Bristol aircrait. The conductingofficer probably.had to look after FrinceBertil while the test pilot,chief engineer and.chief designer got together with CERVELL.As long as this practice is allowed to continueit is a hopeless task to try and preventleakage to the enemy.Duff c me over to say goodbye before goingto .Africa, and made a short speech. He wasvery complimentary about the work of the dept.He spoke about his successor. He thought thatministerially we ought to come under theMinister ofDefence, but for the sake ofconvenience he thought we should probablycome under the foreign Secretary and moredirectly under Dick Law.I had a long letter from Joe Stephenson aboutsignals security in the Middle East. Herefers entirely to allied signals about whichnobody seems to know very much. have spokento Peter Reid and am going to send him a copyf the report.TAR and L talked to the D.G. about thedeception unit for COSSAC. He seems to be ingeneral agreementwith TAR'S scheme which hasnow gone forward.Catalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/19350December 15thAt the Wednesday meeting today hart mentionedthe case of a cover address in Stockholm beingused by the Germ ns which was that of an anti-Nazi committee. This seems to imply the pene-tration of anti-Nazi circles in Stockholm andtheir use as a suitable cover for Abwehr corres-pondence in secret ink.Milmo mentioned the case of a man calledCHAMBORD spying for the Japs in the Argentine,on his way back to Lisbon. he has been takenoff at Trinidad.HOPPE escaped from hospital and asked a priestfor permission to use his phone. The priestappears to h ve overhe ard a certain amount ofwhat was being said and telephoned for thepolice. HOPPE had asked the Argentine imb ssyto send a car for him. de told them that hehad been wrongfully detained. Through one ofB-'s agents we have ascertained that theArgentines were not particularly interested.There is no doubt that HOPPE is a German agent,but he has resisted all our efforts to gethim to talk.Jock Whyte tells me that a report has now comein from Sbockholm to say that STYLES has beenlocated in a hospital. M.I.9 are being asked toinduce him to come over as soon' as possible. ifhe refses to come there is apparently nothingto be done.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193SIAccording to Artist, Ostro works direct toEinzheer in Berlin where one CARNAP has nofunction other than running Ostro. K.O.Portugal forward Ustro's reports for him buttake no part in running his case. WhenCARNAr-is out of Berlin,BECK @ WERNICKE acts as hisrepresentative. Ostro has never disclosed toCARNAP or anyone else who hsi agents are or howhe gets his information. Artist does not believein him. He is however regarded by Berlin3 a sort of prima donna who must not beruffled. Berlin pometimes sends other reportsto Ostro for his evaluation. Artist thinksthis helps him to invent his own reports. Acivil pilot is supposed to act as a courierfor him about once a fortnight. He draws somemoney for his supposed agents but not very muchDecember l6thA message has come through to Garbo, the fulltext of which is being deciphered, recommendinghim to get out of London but to say nothing.I have passed this on to C. who says that itconfirms information he has just received thathe rocket or the Queen Bee may be expectedt rly in January. The nature of his messagewhich is from a good source, is slightly baguesince it refers to the neutralisation of theAir Force. C. said that he would see thatthe information reached Cavendish-Bentinck andthe head of the committee which is looking intothis particular question.C. was much amused by a report which Harker hadshown him giving de COURCY views on StewartCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19352himself. One of the accusations is that C.is the kind of person who would pump you andthen go and tell MI5. C. sees de COURCYfrom time to time in White's and regards himas a poisonous fellow altnougn not unlikeableto meet. He is clever in certain ways butobviously meddles in things which he does notunderstand and is far too big for his boots.C. had no fresh news about the P.M.,who according to the announceent in the Housetoday is ill, with a patch of pneumonia onhis left lung. He heard from him a d y or twoago when he was asking for papers to read.Charles,Butler and Malcolm Cumming are findingout what evacuation arrangements other depts.are making. We apparently propose to retireon Blenheim if necessary. What I would liketo avoid is having all our papers scatteredaround Mayfair with no place to go aind nocommunications. The trouble is that we haveno b ttle headquarters.December 17thI went over to the F.O. to examine certaintelegrams between Washington and London aboutthe suggested setting up of an IntelligenceSecurity org nis ation in Germany after thearmistice. This appears to be a sequel tothe 4-Power declaration in Moscow. The organ-isation is obviously intended to cover theadministration Of the whole of Germany. Thewhole question is very much in embryo. Nodiscussions have so far taken place. I doCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193not imagine that such organisation would53attempt to do more than act as a co-ordin-ating body beteen, ourselves, the Aussiand the Americans. It should not inter-fere with the suggestion of CUSSAC for acounter-intelligence bureau in Germany, thoughit might be advisable for this bureau to havea liaison with the International SecurityIntelligence org nisation which will presum-ably be in Berlin.I met Pollock who is Dur eonsul in Stockholm.He had apparently been talking to the Swedeshere, and knew about CERVELL and OXENTIERNA.He had told the Swedes while discussing thecase of OXENTIERNA that we were extremelyanxious about inform tion leaking out andthat neutrai attaches should for the time beinbe content to sit back and virtually donothing. He received quite a symp thetichearing. The Swede replied that he ratherhad the impression that the AirAttachewas doing a bit too much. In this of coursehe is ite right.The D.G. gave a farewell lunch to Duff. Hetold me that Eddie Grant had asked whether hecould give hima job in N.Africa. I said thatI knew that Eddie had been rather sappoin-ted about not getting a job in COSSAC butquite frankly I did not think he would havebeen p rticularly suit able. Duff agreed. Hethen asked me whether there ywould be any jobfor Eddie after the war. I said it was verydifficult to say. Ne should not haveregional officers but we might have peepleat headquarters who would be going out toCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1935uvisit C.C.s.I saw Jock Whitefoord at his request.He showed me a paper onT.I.S. which hadbeen prepared by Gwyer and Percy.

I(It provides a staif both for the IntelligenceBureau in Germany and for a Liaison Sectionhere. He thinks that the Liaison Sectionshould come under the J.I.C.

Whitefoord said he would give me areply early in January. In principle he wasvery much in favour of it since he thoughtPercy NOuld need somebody to keep hisfeet on the ground. He wanted however toget the organisatior basically settled beforeDick went away. He thought the end of Jan.might be a suit ble time for the visit. Hesaid that he had signed a letter to C. aboutS. S.I. I. (b) units. This leaves in abeyance thequestior of the running of D.A.S and makesit clear that C.E. is not the exclusiveprovince of SIS either in the executive senseor from the point of view of informationCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19355I spoke about TARs memo. I said that I hopedhe would not be alarmed at the demands forpersonnel. I thought we could supply a numberof officers and that the other ranks could besupplied by I.B.2 to a considerable extent.He said that he was leaving this questionentirely to Ops.had a talk with Antony and Jo Archer. Jois going to see Buss and find out whetherInglis has made up his mind as to what shouldbe done about CERVELL. Our proposal is toput forward another paper to the JIC, pointingout what has happened, and suggesting that theChiefs of Staff should close down on visitsboth to aerodromes and factories on the basisof the document picked up in Sicily. Weshould further recommend that these measureswill be ineffective as long as Turner, theAmerican Air Attache, remains in his presentpost, since he is clearly imparting a greatdeal of information to CERVELL. Lastly weshould recommend that Jo should lecture tothe managements of the principle aircraft fact-ories ondthesbasis of the German document.Ic still seems to be very convinced that theperformance of the Spitfire 21 constitutes adefinite le akage and he still thinks thatFather was responsible. Certainly there is agood deal of circunstantial evidence but myown view is that Father is innocent. I basenyself almost entirely on the traffic and on ththegeneral ISOS setup. Meanwhile Fish ispursuing his enquiries.Catalogue Tricycle's Reference:KVT4/193 stock seems be very high and the5bmaterial which he took over to Lisbon has foungreat favour.

He was selectedby Tricycle's brother in order to play thepart of a D.A. and wireless operator.The Germans do not take a very good view ofBalloon. They regard him as lazy and ashaving ppor judgment. They also suspectthat as an Englishman he would never giveanything really vital away though he wouldnot be beyond giving a certain amount inorder to get money. Efforts are being madeto close the Balloon case.Lipstick has announced his intention of marry-ing the daughter of Suner the well-knownCatalan separatist. This is rather an unfor-tunate development since if news of themarriage leaks back to the Germans Lipsticlposition will be jeopardised.The Germans are offering to drop a transmitterfor Mutt and Jeff between the first and tenthJan.Bronx has received a payment for December.Another message has been received for Garbodated 16/12 about arrangements that he is tocatalogue make Reference.RVi4r1g3Bodyline57December lthBuss and TAR came to see me about Crossbow.On the assumption that Crossbow is a magnet-ically conteolled aircraft with a gyroscope,it has been suggested that trenches should bedug along the Kent coast to protect copperwire which will be used in setting up a magnet-ic field by the use of powerful generators.The professor who is in charge of thesepreparations is anxious to know how soon theenemy is likely to become aware of what isgoing on. I said that if he was thinking ofleakage heough spies in this country orthrough individuals going to the Continentor to Eire, it might well take a matter ofmonths. What 1 thought however was far moreprobable was that the. nemy,knowing the possib-le counter-measures to an aircraf't of his owhconstruction, would become aware theoughreconnaissance photos of what we were doing.He might also, for all I knew, make certaindeductions from the electrical disturbances.I could not see ho owever that this shouldnecessarily deter the professor from takingthe measures suggested. I presume thatthese counter-measures have been taken owing ta report that the ski-sites are constructedof material which will not affect a magneticcompass. There is howevee at the moment nopositive evidence that this type of aircraf'tis going to be employed. We may be up againstsome other radio-conteolled device. So farthe Govt. have issued no warning to the publicwhich seems o me a mistake since if even 2 or3 of these aircraft should land up in LondonCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19359and a large number of casualities result, theymay be open to very severe criticism. Itwould, should have thought, be quite easyto have said that a heavy bombardment Of Londormust be regarded as a possibility in the nearfuture and that any bady who is able to leaveshould do SO. It may be of course that thecounter-measures of the air Force, who arebombarding the sites, will be effective,or that the rocket and the aircraft may tulturn out to be damp sqibs., but it seems unwiseto bank on this. The arrangements as regardsGovt.offices appear to be extremely sketchy.Even our own are not very well defined.Jo and L had a talk with Buss afterwardsabout the case of CERVELL. It is agreed thatas soon as the paper was prepared L shouldtake it to Inglis personally and get hisapproval for putting the paper before theJIC. Buss seems to think that Inglis istaking the matter rather lightly. He keepson referring to CERVELL as a first-class airattache. He wishes that some od ours wereas good. CERVELL'S excellence is an airattache is precisely what we are complainilabout. It is the old idea that if a man isfriendly to this country he does not consiti-tute a menace, although Inglis must know aswell as we do that any information he getsultimately reaches the enemy. Jo'S idea isthat in addition to clamping down on visitsby air attaches to aerodromes and factories,we should also get the Society of BritishAircraf't Constructors to issue a warning totheir firms and thart Jo himself should lectureCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN IDEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORSACT 1958.Lineouthe firms on the basis of the document pickedup in Sicily.Jo tells me that the brother of CRETEUR who isat present in the Air Force, was a great frienof Father's. He thinks therefore that Fathermay possibly have told CRETEUR about theerformance of the Spitfire 21 and that CRE-TEUR passed the information on to the Germans.I doubt whethee this is right, since BERTRAN.f'romwhom we first heard of CRETEUR said thathe was asked by HADEMACHER to enquire aboutJUDE and CRETEUR, as he has received no inforn-tion f'rom them. Moreover HADEMACHER in men-tioning CRETEUR said that he was referring tothe one who was formerly a Sabena pilot.We assumed theref'ore that he was referringto Gabriel, who is now at 020.December 20thDuring the weekend I readreport-of90 pages. It is extremely interesting sincet was theough Dr. Kurt JOHANNSEN of Hamburgthat he first came into contact with theAbwehr. Before the war a number of journalisin this country, including Singer and Abs-hagen, used to send reports to JOHANNSEN onpolitical and economic matters, marked"Confidential and not for publication".

Quite obviously thesituation is chaotic. People are beginningto wonder why no spies have been caught, andDudley-Clar is bringing pressure to bearon Hili-Dillon, as he is in great need ofD.A.S. The tendency has been to regard the.I. (b) unit as a body of experts on C.E. andsecurity. As the army know nothing aboutthese matters they pass all such enquiriesand investigations to the S. I. (b) unit whahave no real experience of the kind of WOrequired. There have only been two cases SOfar, one that of an Italian named MANFREDIwhich has been rather mishandled, and theother that of a German named NICKEL. TheAmericans got hold of NICKEL yand interrogatedhim with the S. I(b) unit. They reported thathe. had broken down and was a spy. He wassent by mistake to the USA where enquiryshowed that he was merely a derserter. Hewas then flown back to N.

M.1.5 officers, but it is of course nowtoo late. He are heavily committed for OVER-LORD and even if Hill-Dillon has the grace toask us for assistance I doubt whether we cangive it him. We gave him an opportunity ofhaving our assistance 6 months before theN. African campaign but both he and Viviancontested at the meeting that N. Africa wasforeign territoey and that IS iS had the groundwell covered. In conversations I have hadwith Robb, who has returned from Italy, thesituation on the I.B. front is quite chaotic.He takes a very poor view of Hill-Dillon.Crean, the S.0.0. we sent-out-to sent out to N.

John Mair of courseought to go to Italy and be placed in chargeof I.B. 3working in close co-operation withthe S.I(b) unit.

F'urther confirmation about the stateof affairs in Italy has been obtained froman American O.S.S. officer who has justreturned : to this country.

In view of the rather criticalsituation in Palestine, it has been decidedthat a resume of this material should go outat the earliest possible moment, and shouldbe in thepossession of the High Commissioner.I said that while I heartily concurred viththis view I thought it wasextremely importantto ensure that the material was properlyhandled at the other and. We knew that mostfices in Palestine were penetrated.

It seems fairly clear that Jock Why tedisgusted with the decision not to arrestSTYLES, had binged up the Commandant ofMarylebone to have STYLES arrested by the APM.The latter potested that he could not holdthe man without a proper charge. Jock hadthen seen the Judge Advocate General whorather weekly had preferred a charge of conductto the prejudice of good order and militarydiscipline in that STYLES was seen to havebeen wearing sergeant's uniform and hadimproperly fraternised with the Germans. AtCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19367this stage Cookie and Cussen had been to seethe Judge Advocate and pointed out to himthat at the moment there was no evidence.There were people in this country who couldtestify but no statements had yet been taken.Itwas therefore far better to do as we hadoriginally arranged and allow STYLES to go tohis home, where we would exercise such super-vision as was possible. Meanwhile Spoonernould collect the statements and a chargecould be preferred at a later date. Astatement has now come from Sutton-Pratt indi-cating that STYLES stole the camera previouslymentioned in Malmo and the watches in Stock-holm, and further that his statement abouthis arrival in an unconscious state at Malmoappeared to be untrue.At the weekly meeting today Hart announcedthat a long argument was taking placeas towhether Chester was a port,between Berlin andMadrid.Stamp mentioned the case of FRESSET, anotherairman who has an assignment to fly a planeback to occupied territory. No further pro-gress has been made with the case od de GONDRwhose activities have not given rise to anysuspicion. There is however a mention ofone Eugen BASLER who may be lentical withthe ISOS character BASTLER doemrerly thoughtto be de GONDRA.

Onlybstwo of these letters had been submitted tothe testing dept. The remaining 10 were thensent for testing but in only two cases wasany thing found. The answer is that everyonehas become a bit stale. Ever since thebeginning of the war only one letter hasbeen found, namely the letter written toLHUREYSSENS. The Riot Act has been read inseveral quarters and it is hoped that infuture there will be some improvement. FulFurther tests will be made periodically.Jock Whyte has put forward an obstinate memoin which he urges that STYLES should be placedunder arrest. He has passed it to Jim forhiscomments.Jim says that while it iswithin our powers he still sticks to hisformer recommendation that the ststementsshould be properly checked before action istaken. I have SO informed Jock.I had a talk with Buster and TAR about thecase of CRETEUR. No progress has been madeat 020 and the general impression is thatwe may have got hold of the wrong man or thatRADEMACHER who was obviously vague aboutC's christian name may have made a mistakeor had some ulterior motive in coupling hisname with that of JUDE. It seems clear thatGabriel CRETEUR will have to be released.Thenext difficulty is to decide how to disposeof him. We cannot very well Send him back.Harmer points out that if a man is a piloton an aerodrome it is always open to him toget into an airplane and fly off.

CRETEUR was concerin several respstanbeemovements in Belgiumbefore coming to this countryand there areseveral people who can speak as to his integ-eity, but unfortunately their evidence isnot conclusive. In the absence of positiveevidence we cannot take the risk of CRETEURstepping into an airplane between briefingday and D-day. Milmo is having a talk withCheney of the Air Ministry and Harmer willprobably speak to Col. Wouters of the BelgianAir Force who seems to be a sound person.Meanwhile we may attempt to get some reactionfrom RADEMACHER through Sniper, but this willtake some time.A request for the removal of the W/T setat the Germa.n Legation was made by Dev on th2lst after the latter had been seen by MaffeyDev. v.mentioned thecpossibibity. of the. removalof our own set.

What could he do with hisexisting equipment or with any other equip-ment. to which he could obtain access, and hatwould be the chances of his being detected.Roger Hollis has put up a paper about M/S.He thinks that M and his boys are out of touchwith that each the work section of F.Division, should habe and an he officer suggests whowould be solely responsible for the handlingof the section's agents. This officer shouldwork in the secbion and be fully accuaintedwith all available information. M. should beused as a talent-spotter and adviser. Lentirely agree that M. is out of touch withCatalogue recent ReferencenkV4Rgt3ne communist and fascisfield and that he and his subordinates do notsee nearly enough of the section officers withwhom they are working. L personally do not seM. more than about once in 6 months. Rogertells me he has not seen him for 3 months.My own view is that M. should have far closercontact with sections, and access to reports,if he is going to perform any useful functionat all. While he may occasionally come acrossa suitable agent, i do not think he is in astrong position as a talent-spotter. A sectionofficer will know far more about the person-alities. He will be able to say that so andso is worth buying up or that so and soconstitutes a focal point, whence interestinginformation can be obtained. At this stageM. should be called in to consultation andassist in carry ing out the section's wishes.He could either arrange an indirect appachto the individual concerned or he couldarrange foe an agent to be put in alongside,e.g. as asecretary. His advice in thisconnection should be valuable. He could onnocaccountrun agents on his own without theco-operation of the sevtion. The old systemworked when the office was small and M. wasthaoughly au fait with communist and fascistaffairs. When the office expanded he was alsoof value in giving advice and in handlingagents, for the simple reason that many ofthe people in the sections had no experienceat all. Now that the office has settled do Inand competent people are in charge they areable to do a lot of this work for themselves.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19317There has been a sudden influx of pigeons.On 16/10 there were two enemy pigeons found onboard a Beitish coasting vessel about 7 milesoff Orfordness. One carried a message in Ger-man giving the ring numbers of 5 otherpigeons and its own and stating that the timeof release was 14 hours on the l6th October.Probably the date should have been the 15th.The only other information given was "Clearweather. Wind west". On the 6th Decembera bird came on board a motor-launch 23 milesoff Lowestoft. This one carried a Dutch ringand its wings were stamped "Wehrmacht". Itcarried no message. On the 7th Dec. a pigeoncame on board a vessel in the T'hames Estuary.Itcarried no message but had on its wing"Wehrmacht Brief'taube". On the Bth Dec. apigeon was caught on the RAF station atSwanton Morley. It carried an official Wehr-macht message inan aluminium container givingthe paeticulars,of 5 birds including its own.On the Bth also/birds came into the loft ofa fancier 8 miles north of Norwich. Itswings were stamped "Wehrmacht" and it carriedno message. It would seem that the enemy wermaking a new departure in the use ofpigeons and that they are training them forflights over the N.Sea. There are twopossible reasons: firstly the birds may beundergoing training dor use on E. boats wishingto keep wireless silence; secondly the enemymay be using pigeons on practice flights asnear to our coast as they can conceniently getin order ultimately to use these birds forcarry ing back messages from agents in thiscountry. in comparing the two possibilitiesCatalogue Reference:kV/4/193THIS IS A COPYEORIGINAL DOCUMEN'T RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTTON3 (4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 19582600it would seem unlikely that the enemy wouldsuddenly decide to use birds on E. boats whenhe would have done SO at any time during thelast 4 years.

The Swedes thenwent to the Americans, which was the causeof ColTuner's visit to Sweden.furnerhassince been in the USA but Inglis does notwhat the outcome of the American negotiatiShas been. He thinks it a pity that we do notsupply the Swedes with aircraft both on a shortterm and a long term view. Turner hus beenvery helpful in keeping Inglisx informed ofall the moves in this game, and it is for thisreason that he does not want to offend Turner.He also knows CERVELL extremely well. He likeshim buit realises that his excellence as anair attache makes him dangerous. Inglis agreesto the recommendations in our paper. He findsit difficult hoveer to find a means of neutral-ising Turner. I have suggested that he mightapproach Gen.Peaboey. Peabody could then speakbo Turner on the basis of the document pickedup in Sicily,explair to him that the Britis'were stopping all visits and instructing hito be extremely ciecumspect in his relationswith neuteal attaches. While this would notbe wholly satisfactory, it might go some waytowarsa tightening things up.I went to seewith J.C. and Ronnie Reed.He was very pleasant and civil and I thinkhonest of purpose.

He says thatnowt tht the Falange militia has been abolishedthere is little danger from the Spanishpolice. He would like if possible to returnwith Costa Rican papers or failing these WithBrazilian. I suggested to him that if hewere going back it might be better for hismother to remain in Spain since people wouldconsider it rather odd if she disappeared.He seemed to agree about this and thoughtthat he would be able to gauge the situationbetter when he got back. He Nould in manyways prefer to see his mother in this country.I had a talk with Gwyer about arrangementsfor the Counter-Intelligenee Bureau in Germanyater the war, and the necessary staff heretodeal with its enquiries. Jock Whitefoordhas put forward a draft note to the W.0. inwhich he suggests that a Lounter-Intelligeneeoard should be set up here in addition to aninformation section. A C-I.B. would when indifficulties appeal to the JIC. I have said ththat I feel that the C-I.B. is redundant.

It Nas proposed that they shouldbe landed at Casablanca and interrogated.Those who were undesirable would be sent toEngland for internment, while the remainderwould be sent back to Italy. It was explainedto SIS that the H.O. would be extremely annoyeif they were not informed about the possiblearrival of these individuals. We Nere notparticularly anxious to have them here since althe information that they could give would beextracted by Muggeridge in.Algiers. It seemedhowever that only by agreeing with the propo-sals of AFHQ would the Italians be deportedCatalogue Reference.KV/4/193 t all.74I rang up Loxley to whom I explained theposition.

Africa tosend large numbers here since they Nould onlyclutter up the camps and eventually bereleased. We would prefer that as many aspossible went back to Italy.I had a talk with Chaney and Beaumont aboutthe French airmen coming here on ordres demission.

I impressed uponhim that however thorough the examinationin N. Africa would appear to be it could notpossibly cover the ground that we are in aposition to cover at the LRC. At presentwe receive no copies of the reports drom N.Africa and since the data they contain is neverpassed over thee records at LRC we may bemissing quite a lot.

'TheAmericans are interested in this man'sbanking account which we obtained under an80a warrant. explained to Thurston thatit was of paramount importance that nolegal action should be taken upon thisinformation in the USA. It could only beused as a pointer for other enquiries. lf tthere was any slip-up not only would ourrelations be seriously jeopardised vis-a visthe banks but also ourrelations ith theFBI. orse still, we might be liable doraction. Thurston said he was certain thatthe FBI would respect our confidence indwould thoroughly appreciate the position sincthey themselves were liable to an action inthe USA unless they obtained informationunder sub-poena.Thurston told me that he would be leaving usCataloguerReference.kv4/93igne from the FBI in3order to join the Army. He had been rying tget his release for a long time but had beentalked out of it by Ladd. This is quite aserious step for him since he would not bere-admitted to the FBI. He feels that he isa young man and ought to be shouldering arifle, for which I very much admire him. Hevill be a great loss to us bere.L had a meeting ith Boooke-Booth, Hart, Robb,Chaney of the Air Ministry, Cheney and Stampon the question of the arrival of alliednationals here from N. Airica. From infor-mation supplied by Robb it was quite clearthat the French LRO and the French systemof granting Ordres de Commission providedno security whatsoever and would have in futulto be totally ignored. e agreed that infuture all allied airmen should be looked upby SIS,B. IReg. Central Reg. and LRC andthat all those who had come out of occupiedFrance should go to the LRC. As regardsother arms of the Services, and civilians,a similar proposition would be adopted,except that only those who nad come out sincethe occupation nould he looked up.The British consul at Algiers should infuture be instructed to notify us of all Casesthere he granted a visa to someone whohascome out since the 0 cupation. Chaney wouldmake his on arrangements through his repre-sentative in N. Africa that visas ere notgranted to allied airmen unless there was aspecific job for them in this country. SCOswould be instructed that the fact that anCatalogue Reference:KVI4/193allied national had come out of occupiedterritory since Nov. 1942 should constituteprime facie grounds for sending him to theARC. For some reason or other this has notbeen done in the past.Dick and I vent to see Jock hitefoord. Hetold us about his visit to C. the other daywhen U. had said that the business of thepreparation of the information relating toOccupied Territory and to Germany was amatter for Section V and the COSSAC rear echel-on should virtually come under Section V.C. had said rather airily that he couldprovide the officers to do this work. I toldJock Whitefoord that in my view C. was totallyll-infored as to what was going on. Hecould not provide the necessary staff nordeindeed was his own office likely to producemuch information relating to Germany. Theprinciple contributors Nould be M. .1.14 I. 14 onGestapo matters, PE and possibly ourselves.C's whole idea was based on a misconceptionthat this was a territorial matter. Ourview was that the normal division between5 and 6 did not enter into the case whereintelligence within the zone of the armieswas concerned. We eventually hammered outa formula which we hope ill be acceptable.The collating staff is to be under COSSACbefore the operation and directed by MclLeodthe new G. I.B.

This should ensure thatthe work is done properly and prevent itfrom getting into the usual section V muddle.It is really upto the Army to make theirdemands but they are all SO chicken-heartedand SO ignorant about the real issues thatthey never have the guts to stand up fortheir rights.Mhitefoord introduced me to Williams, thenew BGSI, 21st Army group. He is a MertonDon, aged about 30, who has been with Montyfrom Alamein, to Sicily.Barker-Benfiel has been thron out on hisear. Williams is a personal friend of T-Rand is also known to J.C. So we ought to havehim in the bag with an MI5 label tied roundhis neck.Hempel has received instructions not tohand over his wireless set. Unforrounatelyhe has already done So.I had a long talk with Toby Mathew at theclub. I explained to him what ve had in mindwith regard to Miss Nunn. He seemed to thinkthe scheme would work admirably. 1 said thatwe should leave it largely to her discretionas to what sne passed on to higher officersin the .,including Newsam, but that we wereunder certain difficulties sinee we were thecustodians on behald of SIS for a good de dealof highly secret material which we were notnormally authoeised to impart to anyone else.I had however got special permission toacauaint Miss Nu with the nature od theseCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193dsources. We intended therefore to go thehole hog. I very much ho ed that this wouldresult in a greater confidence by the H.0.in MI5. t seemed to me that there was novery great understanding of the work donehere, since I gathered that recently the HOhad made a bid to take us over ministerially.Toby Mathew knew about this. THere hadapparently been a storm from the fightingserviceswhenthe suggestion vas made. Ithen went on to say that the police wereequally ignorant of what we did and that ithad reached me from a variety of sources thatthe Commissioner and Norman Kendal wereinclined to run us down in consequence.Mathew said that he thous ht that peobablyMI5 knew a great deal more about the policethan the police did about MI5, from which Iimplied that ne probably bly had some knowledgeof the report that we had put up in theSTOCKMAN case. In any case he is well awareof the corruption that is going on. He toldme that the H.O were looking for a newCommissioner of Police. The job had beenoffered to Talter Monckton but that he hadturned it down. Did I know of any suitabl?candidate? I strongly recommended Hordernalthough L said that L could not speak fromvery intimate knowledge, beyond saying thatour relations with him were excellent and thathis force appeared to be a highly efficientone. My knowledge was confined largely toHordern as a man and personal friend. Ihad the highest regard for his integrity.He struck me as being fearless, frank andhonest, certainly a personality and one whommen would be ready follow. I knew thatCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193he from time to time went into the H.0.and rapped the table. It might be thereforethat he was not very popular in variousquarters. I did not feel howeer that thisshould prejudice his chances. Mathew saidthat he did not know him but that he wouldcertainly give the question consideration.He did not think a great deal of Shillitonor did he appear to have heard Teggart'sname mentioned. The I.0. are looking forsomeone who will clean up the mess withoutdestroying public confidence. Thry want agood atmosphere and a man who wulll be able toweather the extremely difficult period whichis bound to occur after the nar. I told Mat-hew that the police were disgruntled abouttheir pay, that in my view the heads wereliving somewhat in a vacuum, that they didnot know their D.D.I.'S, that if the D.R I.was wrong prdably the hole station was wrongand that the police would not welcome theappointment of another ex-General,4 ir Marshalor Admiral. L think they would far ratherhave a man who had some experience of policeduties.Mathew expressed grave dissatisfaction withthe D.P.P. He never wishes to prosecuteunless he is 100% certain of winning his case.Often the 11.0. or the Treasury wish to beingan action merely to show that certain crimesor misdemeanours do not passyunnoticed. Insuch cases they never can get the D.P.Pto move. 1 told him that we liked the D.P.Ppersonally but our experience was somewhatsimilar.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193Mathew said that Maxwell was a strong supporterof the D.G., that they got on extremely welltogether. Newsam on the other hand seemsto dislike the D.G. because he gets bittenby the latter at the Executive and is notconsulted in matters affecting this office.Mathew does not dislike Newsam but thinkshis manners are extremely bad.January BthI saw the D.M.I. this morning about ISPAL I.Paget has taken out a copy of Kellar's memoand will discuss it with Maunsell on arrival.It is quite possible that he will leave it inMaunsell's safe custody. He would like twocopies of the detailed dossier to go to Pagetand possibly 3. One copy would be held inine W.O. He mentioned TAr's plan for deceptiorduring Second Front operations and asked mewhether L thought it was necessary for me tohold a meeting. I said L thought it wouldbe desirable for him to see TAR,Barrow,V Nhite-foord and probably Jarvis-Reed. I emphasisedvery strongly that if deception could be usedat all in the field it Nould be essentiallyan ops matter. He is going to call a meetlrgnext week. He thinks that possibly the W.Board ought to be informed of the general plan.He was very worried that whitefoord had usedthe words double agent in a lotter. L ex-plained to him that the Germans used D.A.and that it was common form the world over.The only thing that really mattered was thatthe Germans did not know the extent to whichNe are doin it. eD.M.I. has a curiousCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193complex about this matter and seems to thinkthat nobody has ever heard of a D.41. exceptourselves.The bombing of the budyline and Crossbov targein rance is going on systematically ind isthought to be fairly effective though onlyabout 17 of the sites have SO far been dealtth. lf Crosspon is working on a magneticompass it is thought that the round willbe SO impregnated witn metal from thebombing that the controlled aircrait will beput right off their course.Dick and TAR talked to me about ascheme fortadying u the ork of the division, possiblyunder two A.D.B.S, Hart beine the other.

Any-Catalogue:Reference:kV/4l19? wool pulled over niseyes.91I asked Loxley how the SIS committee was goingon. He said they held a meeting apout once aweek of a very informal kind. They had seenC. ,Dansey, Vivian,( woolcombe, Denniston, Travis.It looks rather as if the G. C & C.S. were gointo have an F.0. administrative head but pre-sumably C. will remain the custodian of sourceLoxley thinks that now that the consulaorservice is amalgamated vith the FO there willbe an opportunity of putting consuls moreau fait with secret material. At presentthey know nothing about it and are alwaysrather uneasy about British agents operatingin their area and in consequence not alwaysvery co-operative. He thinks that if they knemore about the whole set up better resultsmight be ac ieved. i asked him franklyhat he thought about the question of amalgimation of Section V and ourselves. le thoughtprimarily that you could not separate subver-sive movements nd C.E. and I think 1 con-vinced him that ordinary security measurescould not be divorced from either of theother subjects. He felt definitely that itwas a waste of time for Section V and our-selves to be covering the same ground and thatsome form of amalgamation, possibly with adual responsibilit to the .0 and 1.0., wasessential. He did not think th t any stepswhich were being taken now would prejudicesuch an amalgamation.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193a9January 17thReturned from leave.The US casualties up to December 23rd have-been published. The total is 105,229 for theArmy. This figure includes 16,031 killed,38,916 Nounded, 24,067 missing and 25,415prisoners. Casualties among the American ele-ments of the 5th Army since the invasionof Italy is 17.119, which include 2,790killed, 11,762 wounded and 2,559 missing.The latest figures of casualties in the Navy,Marine Corps and Coastguards are 15,186 killed6,616 wounded, 8,429 missing, and 4,292prisoners, bringing the total casualties forall Services to 139,752. This total isremarkable after two years of war, particular-ly when one considers that the casualtiesfor the first 24 hours of the Battle of theSomme were 100,000,000.Cecil tells me that the two Irish parachutistswho came down in Eire few weeks ago wereboth S.D. agents. We are doing our best toassist the Irish in their interrogations,but they have not So far sueceeded inextracting very much.The P.M. has passed on a wire that ne hasreceived from the President indicating aLeakage from the British Embassy in Cairoabout Anglo-Turkish relations. The reportcame from OSS and was believed to be reliable.The Chiefs of Staff are apparently veryconcerned. It seems possible that theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19393information may have been derived from thebreaking of Turkish cyphers. We know fromthe case of Max GERHARD, an agent capturedin the M.E. and formerly a member of theGerman Cryptographic Bureau in Athens, thatTurkish cyphers have been read for some time.It seems that at the meeting at TeheranStalin expressed the view that the phrases"unconditionalosurrender" was an unfortunateone. He thought that the Germans out tohave been told that if they gave up they wouldbe treated reasonably.According to a neutral source of SIS, afterthe meeting between Eden and the Turkish For-eign Secretary, which had been rather stormy,Turkey was faced with a peremptory Russiandemand that she should take a definite standwith regard to the war not later than 31/12.and this demand was backed by t.Britain.It was then that President Inonu decided tochange tactics and to inform the Alllies thatTurkey was ready to enter the war with herlimited resources in infantry,machine-gunsand artillery, provided the Allies were readyto fulfil their partof the bargain. Stein-hardt, the American mbassadoe at Ankara,persuaded Roosevelt and the P.M. that theTurkish policy was reasonable. Rooseveltsucceeded in persuading Stalin to change hisformer intransige nt attitude towards Turkeyinto a more moderate one.CERVELL has written another despatch in whichhe speculates on the date of the opening ofCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193the Second Front. He bases his informationpartly on his own observations, and partlyon those of a Czech officer with whom he isvery friendly He has btained permissionto visit an American bomber unit whichoperates with Marauders. This again goesto show that unless there is some concertedplan between ourselves and the Americansabout foreign attaches and their visits,we will be wasting our time in tightening upprecautions for our own aerodromes andfactories.Dick tells me that he has had a good deal oftrouble at COSSAC. It seems that Jock White-foord has sold the pass and that the informa-tion required for forthcoming operations isto be collated in Section V and not at NorfolkHouse. Dick is preparing a statement andI propose to go and see C. on the wholequestion. I gather however that TAR's pro-posals about the running of XX have beenaccepted, largely due to the fact that Foleyhas generously stated trthat this work can bedone better by B. B.IA IA than SIS.Tricycle has now been questioned on his stayin Lisbon and it is clear that he has beenextremely successful, and that the material hetook with him is very highly regarded both inLisbon and Berlin. Karsthoffy obtained agree-ment at the Abwehr conference at Baden-Badenthat Tricycle was to be entrusted with themost secret and important tasks. In Lisbonhe was treated like a hero by all concernedCatalogue including Reference:KV14/193 Schreiber is now moving toasBerlin as head of Einzheer est. For thefirst time he was able to persuade theGermans to pay his extremely liberal salaryin advance. During the visit Freak dulypassed through the escape route and Tricyclewas able to arrange that the next batch ofescapees should not contain any agents butshould consist entirely of persons whom hehad nominated. He further secured acceptancepf the condition that if at any time in thefuture any agents were to be sent out throughthis route, they must be chosen by Dreadnaughtwhich would ensure that their people Nouldknow from the start that they are to XX theGerm ns. Tricycle is to return towards theend of February when he will be expected totake back answers to some of the questionswhich he brought. He was told by Karsthoffafter the Baden-Baden conference that he wasregarded as the No.] agent. Tricycle hasbrought Gelatine a fresh ink, instructionsto re eive communications by duff, and aquestionnaire,money etc. He was to deliverthis material to Gelatine ithout disclosinghis identity. The judgment on Gelatine inLisbon was that she did not know what wasimportant and that while her letters containeda lot of nonsense she occasionally withoutknowing it included something of considerableimportance.T Te Mutt and Jeff case is still in doubt owingto the possibility of its having been blownby KARL, the German who was repatriated fromthe Nazi camp which had communication withCamp WX. As the dropping operation did nottake place in spite of Jeif over-staying hisCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193leave for 2 day s communication has broken offat the end of last weck and an attempt will bemade to force the Germans to carry out theoperation later. Meanwhile it has been decidethat Mutt should forthwith be moved notionallyto an OCTU SO as to get him avay from Scotlandand in this way it is hoped that whatever theGerm ns believe in the case, 0 harm willbe done and possibly may help in continuingthe case.The Germans interest in Brutus appears to bereviving and they are starting to ask interesting questions.A letter has been received from Hamletenclosing correspondence from Bergman of AstBrussels, showing that the latter does stillnot have the confidence of Berlin in runningthis ase. At the same time Hamlet hasoffered Puppet 15,000 pesetas payable inMadrid.Milmo has made out his analysis of Camp 020cases for the year 1945. The total numberof cases held on 31.12.43 was 120 as again90 on the same date in 1942,.and 54 on thesame date in 1941. 67 were admitted in 1943,18 released, 7 transferred and 2 prosecuted.Of those admitted in 1943, 54 proved to bespies as against 43 in the previous year. Ofthe above 54, there were 39 Cases in whichthere were identifiable traces,or ISOS (anincrease from 55.8 to 72.2 % over the previousyear). There were 21 cases in which thecapture of the agent was attributable to ISOS,Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19391an increase from 35% to 38.9 %. There were15 cases for which there was no identifiabletrace on ISOS at all, a decrease deom 44. 2%to 27.8.01 27. 8% Of the total of 54, 30 were eaptnedabroad, as against 14 in the previous year,and 24 in the U.K. as against 29 in theprevious year. Out of the total od 24 appre-hended in the U.K., only 22 were intendedto operate in this country. Of these ISOSshowed traces of 16, 3 were captured onaccount of ISOS. l6 gave themselves up orwere D.

Of the 3 whose capturewas attributable to ISOS, MENEZES wouldcertainly have been otherwise detected,HUY SMANN would almost certainly have beendetectedpdwhi LALOU'S fate would havebeen problematical.

A further piece of evidencehas been obtained from MAP to the effect thatARMSTRONG signed a statement before taking uphis position in which he agreed that he wouldnot accept any commissions from firms.furtherI attended the JIC today when our/paper aboutattaches was discussed. It was decided to iss-ue a further warning from the P.M. about thedangers of discussing confidential matterswith foreign attaches, particuarly neutrals.As regards Service attaches, the JIC wouldCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19396recommend that all visits to establishmentsand factories shoid for the time being berefused. Lastly it was decided to obtain asfar as possible the co-operation of theAmericans and particuarly on the air side.Inglis would approach Peabody on the basisof the document picked up in Sicily and wouldpoint out to him the dangers of serviceattaches communicatingwith neutrals. Hewouldget Peabody to talk to Turner about hisrelations with various neutral attaches,particularly the Swedes.S/Ldeader Chaney came to see me at my requestabout SEMPILL. We had intercepted a: letterfrom him to SEMPILL indicating that he wouldlike to see the latter on his return fromCanada. Chaney told me that thiswas in con-nection with a prpposal to form a committeeand a club for Polish air officers. Fundswere to be raised for the purpose of helpingdistressed officers particularly those whohad got into debt. The Poles did not reallylike the idea but did not wish to tuen downwhat appeared to be a generous offer fromthe noble lord. The moving spirit isapparently a Mrs. Stafford LEWES, formerlyknown as the Countess Carla JENSEN. Thislady has written a book about the spyingactivities of the British Govt. in the lastwar. She is an advenutress of the first orderand was a short time ago declared a bankrupt.Her debts have now been paid by her husbandwho is a ealthy stockbroker, possibly inorder to enable her to bring an actionagainst ady Jersey (Virginia Cherrill) whocataloguenReferenee:KV/4/193 indiscreetly about99Mrs. Stafford LEWES being a 5th columnist.The latter has given out that she can riasethousands of pounds but when pressed to sayhow much she had raised, she gave the figureof E225. Her committee consists of LordSEMPILL, Chairman, Sir Hector MnNeil, whosegeneral undesirability is well-known, SirHector's aughter Moira Montgomery, LadyManton, Mrs. Stafford Lewes, Sec. and JohnMills @ Jan Milstein of the Ambsssadors Club,treasurer. It is perhaps a little curiousthat Mrs. Stafford LEES is believed to rungambling parties, Presumably her idea isto fleece the Polish Air Force officers bygambling and then pay them back out of fundswhich she will raise from the public.Meanwhile effort are being made to persuadethe LCC to ref'use a licence for the cluband the Poles have been induced to deferacceptance of Lord SEMPILL'S offer for 3 monthChaney has seen SEMPILL'S secretary in hisabsence. She states that he knos nothingabout Mrs. Stafford LEWES, but that the ladyhad written to him and asked him to be presi-dent of the club, and he, wishing to furtherwhat he considered a good cause, had acceptedthe proposal. SEMPILL apparently has an officat 120 Pasl Mall, on the top floor, wherehissecretary resides. There is no name onthe door.January 19thI had a word with Miss Nunn who under Cussen'sable direction doing a tour of B. DivisionShe is most interested in what she has seenalready. L explained to her that L had, notCatalogue Reference:kV/4/193fowithout difficulty obtained permission for herto be let in on most secret material but thatthis permission did not strictly go beyondherself. L felt hoveer that if she was ques-tioned by the Home Secretary, Sir AlexanderMaxwell or Sir Frank Newsam, she should beas forthcoming as she thought necessary. Asregards her immediate superiors or other senioofficers in the H.0., L did not feel that sheshould disclose her sources but was quitready to leave it to her diseretion, seeingthat she had been in highly confidentialpost as Sir Alexander waxwell's secretary,to impart as much information in generalterms as she thought the occasion demanded.I impressed upon her that I was going slightlyoutside my powers and that if any thing wentwrong L should be in very serious trouble.At the Wednesday meeting Noakes mentionedthe case of WIJKAERT, the Belgian who hasrecently arrived here and seems to have beenmore intimately tied up with the Germans thanhe led us to believe in his statement. Hiscase is very similar to that of de GRAAF.Iasked whether S.L A had been brought intothe case as they might possibly wish to take astatement. Milmo said that at the momentthere was not sufficient evidence to renderthis necessary.Gerog n talked about the teleprinter serviceof theEire newspapers.

HOY SE was beingdefended by at iiastings, ARMSTRONG: by KaakiROberts and Bloss by Beyfus,K.c. The prosecution was conducted by Maxell Fyfe, theSolicitor General, and Byrne. Pat Hastings man exremely good opening speech for theDet'ence although he was at times a littletoo facetious to carry conviction. He didvery little in the way of cross-examiningBurt, Spooner or Fish. He was up to all hisusual tricks of trying to discredit the case Crosecution in the eyes of the jury. He saidthat Sir Hugo hd gone in for aircraft cons-traction because his son vas interested incivil aviitlon but his son had joined up andhad been killed in action. air Hugo's oneambition was to construct the best possibleaircraft that could be designed.

Dick said that heintended to contest the issue and ii possible1bring it before the JIC. He agreed thatperhaps Gwyer would have one better to navediscussed the deficiencies of the C rds WithCarew-Huntin'th first instance. The meetingI gather was outiardly amiable and it wasdecided that Dick should have 3 talk withGwyer andto try and effect thenecessary improvements.January 20thI attended the Old Bailey gain this morningwhen HIOYSE was cross-examined. He did notmake a good impression ind clearly the Judgewas not, on his side. The most difficultquestion that he had to answer WUIS why. heCatalogterelereheeRV4a9s to open a specialaccount for his transaction with ARMSTRONG103hen he could habe quite easily got an over-draft throgh his bank. This would seem tohave been far and away the most desirabllecourse seeing that the defence had stressedvery strongly the personal nature of thetransaction. The account that he opened wasin his own name and in that of the secretaryof Cunliffe-0 ens, and the amount had beenfinally debited to Sir Hugo's personal accountInother words the transaction Nas given verymuch a company flavour rather than a personalone. HOYSE really had no answer except thathe had not given the matter much thoughtand had done it that way because it seemed themost convenient. Sir Hugo went into the boxand made a bad impression under cross-ex minat-ion. He said that he knew nothing of thetransaction until the police enquiries hadbegun. Then asked what he would have thoughtof the transaction had he been aware of it,he said he did not know what he would havethought. Later he was asked about the saleof BLOSS'S shares in the cinema company.

He wasthen asked hether he did not consider itrather peculiar that two millionaires shouldbe telephoning about such a paltry sum as E200which to them would merely be a matter ofpocket-money. He said that he was not in thehabit of doin this but in this ise it wasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1931oumerely an ordinary business transaction.I had a meeting in the afternoon with HorrocksBrooke-Booth, Ede, Dick, Dick,Gwyer,Stamp,Ke Gwyer, er,Stamp, Ke Larand Burn about the Black List which istocome into operation after Stage A. We allagreed that the Purple Primer would notprovide a satisfactory basis for such aBlack List since it was inadesuate and sinceit was to be used solely on a regionalbasis. It did not get over the difficultyof an alien failing to get a visa in Lisbon anproceeting to Notterdam or Stockholm.and gettingit there. Apart from this, air travel afterthe war would probably be far easier. Onemight even have a case of a man failing toget a visa in Europe and proceeding to theUSA for his papers. it seemed therefore thatsuch a list should be on a world-nide basis.it was finally agreed that we should carefullyprepare a list of British subjects who hadbeen in enemy-occupied territory and werebelieved to have been associated with theGerm nS, which would come into force at StageA. ind that we should circulate all sectionsasking or their views as to the type ofperson who should feature on the interna-tional list and the standard of indormationrequired for his includion on th t list.4I had a talk with Herbert about the future ofthe office. He still thinks that if we tookover C E. it would benecessary to conductcertain enquiries abroad, if not in peace timecertainly in war time, and that we shouldtherefore have to have the necessary organisa-Catapogue tion Reererce:KV4/193tthat L thought that(oswhile it was necessary to have some sort ofposition overseas whichwould enable us tocarry out direct liaison with ournoppositenumbers we could leave the active enquirieson foreign territory to SIS. This would ofcourse postulate something like a Section Vorganisation. I thought that this wasnevitable since any other scheme scheme.wouloalways be open to criticism that you could nohave two organisations operating onforeign territory.It has been decided to send Sir John Dashoodto Ankara to investigate the Case of leakagerelating to our plans for operations in theBalkans. It is quite clear from ISOS thatcertain documents have gone astray between Si:(natchbull-Hugesson's return to Cairo and thedate of the fiest ISOS message, which actuallgave one of the code names of the operation.There was a leakage some time ago from theBritish Embassy in Ankara when it was clearthat an agent had been getinto the Ambassadostaff. The position was never cleared up,or do I think it likely to be by Sir JohnDashwood, ho has no experience whateverof investigation. This is once more a caseof territorial division beteen ourselvesand other departments instead of functionalones. An invesitgation of this sortcould best be conducted by a combination ofHart, Cussen and Burt.

I shotshould not be very keen on taking over inany case. In the present atmosphere theposition would be intolerable.Dick had a meeting withand Gwyerwhen differences of opinion were ironed outmore or less aatisfactorily.January 21stI attended a meeting of the l.Board. TARbrought the position up to date as regardsthe D.A.S at present at the disposal of theXX Committee. He then explained about theunfortunate incident at Camp "X which hasprobably resulted in the blowing of Muttand Jeff, if not also of Tate. The latterhowever webelieve has got away with it. Thenext point was Brutus. The N.Board agreedthat he could be used for deception on theorder of battle provided this were done onpresent lines and discreetly. The WN.Boardexpressed confidence in the agents who wereto be used for the purpose of deception inOverlord. Lastly we discussed the questionof approving authorities. It was agreed thatCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19107Wild recently brought back from the Mediterranean and an officer who had worked underDudley -Clark should be the approving authorityboth bitish and American in COSSAC, and shouldbecome a member of the XA Committee. If heneedsa deputy it vill probabl have to be anAmerican. That officer would have to beinitiated. Present at the meeting were DMI,DNI, Sir indlater Stewart, A/C.Buss, Cowgill,TAR, Montagu and myseld.Cecil has had a lot of trouble over a questionin the house by Little of an Ulster constituen-cy who is agitating about the Irish parachu-tists and urging that the seriousness of thesituation should be taken up with the Eire auth-orities. Little was not satisfied with theanswer he got and now proposes to raise thequestion on the adjournment. It has beendecided that the Home Secretary should seeSir Basil Brook, the Ulster P.M. who is overhere at the moment, explain to him that we arein close touch with the Eire authoritiesin this matter and they are proving extremelyco-operative. Basil Brooke will then beauthorised to bellrLittleethat from enquiriesne has made he is satisfied that the Eireauthorities are doing all they possibly canand that Mr Devalera will implement hispledge not to allow southern Irelandoto becomea base for operations against this country.It is hoped in this way to get Little towithdrew his motion.The DMI called a meeting to discuss the useof DAs for deception in Overlord. Otherspresent were Whitefoord, Fleetwood-Hesketh,Catalogue Reference:kV/4/193(o%Jarvis-Reed, Wild, Bevan, Kirkman, C. Cowgill,TAR and my self. Whitefoord had obviouslysold out to SIS. He thought that the unitshould be with the S.C.I. unit (S.C.I. is thenew description for ths S.I.(b) S. (b) or I.B.1 unit.It means Secret Counter-Intelligence andconforms with American nomenclature). Therewas obviously some sense in this claim inthat the S.C.I. unit has the communicationsand is also the recipient of ISOS. More- Cover it has an establishment with facilitiesfor moving about. The only objection is thatcont ol is maintained by SIS. Personally Ithink that in the field it would probablywork. Cowgill and C. then made it clear thatthey were proposing to make use of Frenchofficers. I asked whether these officerswere experienced in D.A. work and was told thatthey were. It was however agreed that Harmershould go as D. A. expert and that we shouldhave a pool of 8 officers available here to besent out at any moment. We should furtherundertake to train 4 American officers whowould be working in the American Army Group.The final position of the Deception Unit,which it was originally felt should be undeOps B. has been deferred pending discussionsbetween Wild, who is Bevan's dece tion man inthe European theatre, MI5 and MI6. wildis very much on our side and I am sure illuseall his influence to see that control isunder Ops B. rather than the SyC.I. When anagent has been captured in the field it is forconsultation bewteen S.C.I. and Ops B. as towhether he is suitable for deception purposes.Two things seemed to stand out at this meeting,firstly that Cowgill was struggling to maintainCatalogue Reference.KV/4/193109control of D. A. S in the S.C.1. unit andthat apart from Harmer he did not intend todraw very much on the MI5 pool. His idea isto give the cases to the Frenchmen and I canquite see a situation arising when our poolof 8 officers here will be twiddling theirthumbs waiting in vain for call. It maybe that Harmer will be able to adjust this.If of course he is under Ops B. he will be ina much stronger position. I impressed uponWild after the meeting the dangers of theF'rench getting hold of these cases and theimportance of getting in on them at theearliest possible moment. When an agent is d.:f'd. it should then be a matter for consulta-tion between all concerned as to how he isto be arrested. If this is badly done andleft in the hands of the French, deceptionagents will be spoilt before they ever reachOps.B. .C's strangle-hold on this whole partyis (a) the ISOS and (b) his direct wirelesscommunication Jock whitefoord was scepticalabout the possibilities of taking agetns overto France, either notionally or otherwise.It was however pointed out to him that wehad a fellow notionally in the FSP who wouldinform his masters that he was going overseas.They might then arrange for sets to be deposi-ted with various agetns SO that if he was inthe vicinity he could use these sets forpurposes of communication. It was mentionedthat their might be cases where a deceptionagent would be left behind, the S.C.I. unithaving moved elsewhere. TAR suggested thatthe case officer should use the agent's setboth for communication with the enemy andcommunication with Ops B or S.C.I. in the fieldCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193C. said to me after the meeting that he wasin favour of the attachment of our people tothe S.C.I. unit and that he would jolly wellsee that things worked. He rather impliedthat if there were any difficulties from theSection V point of view he would very quicklycall them to order.I had a talk with Bevan about the leakage ofdocuments relating to our Balkan plans fromthe nbassy at Ankara. He said that he hadheard about this and that he had been rung upyesterday evening by codrington's people withsome suggestion that he should prepare adeception document. He agreed with me thatthe idea was a good one (a) f'rom the pointof view of neutralising the ill effects ofthe leakage and (b) from the point of viewof detecting the collaborator. He was howverlargely in ignorance as to what the documentscontained. It was obviously impossible for himto prepare any counter-documents unless hecould see the full text end unless he knewprecisely the cirxumstances in which the leak-age had taken place. He expressed his intentioof looking into the matter.January 22ndThere was a rather heavy raid last night. 99planes crossed the coast, half of them at about9 pm and the other half at 4.30 a.m. On thefirst occasion 14 got through to London andon the second 13. 16 in all were broughtt downA fewbombs were dropped in London and thesuburbs and a certain number in Kent.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193One landed 22 divisions at 5 am today southof Rome.

The fighting howveris extremely difficult, firstly owing to thehilly country and secondly owing to theextensive mining of the forward areas.L dined with J.C. and Thornton of M.I.3 lastnight. Thornton talked a certain amountabout the lussians. He said they were in manyways very difficult. I spoke about the recentincident of the Pravda publishing an imagineryinterview in the Pyrenees between Hibbentropand certain British officials. He thoughtthat Moscow had done this out of pique owingto the attitude we had taken up abouteastern Poland. He agreed with me that theRussians would understand us much better ifwe told them quite bluntly when and how theygot off. Hequoted an instance when Gen.F'irebrace who was looking af'ter the nussiahere had been the recipient of complaintsby the Russians about what they were shownin this country. Firebrace eventually cameto the end of his tether and said "If you havegot any complaints to make, you had betterget in the car and we will go straight and youcan make them to the C.I.G.S. direct". T'heRussians shut up like oysters and no furthercomplaints were heard.Gilbert Ry le told me that the ISK situationis not as bad as they expected. T'wo changeshave taken place, one on the first and theCatalogue Reference:kV/4/1932other on the 15th of the month and apparentlythere were to be no further changes. whilethis has resulted in a temporary decrease inthe product owing to the dif'ficulties ofgetting it out, it is thought these difficultiewill beowercome fairly soon. The situationwith regard to the peninsula is less seriousthan in regard to the Balkans.There has been a blaze in the press aboutarrest of HELMUTH. tt is important that weshould stop a question being asked in thehouse as to why he has not been tried.

There is no real reasonwhy he should.I took Dick's meeting this morning. Milmoinformed the meeting that MANFREDI, the spyfrom Italy, had been broken at Camp 20. Thisman, concerning whom there were ISOS traces,was interrogated by the S.I(b) unit and boththey and Hill-Dillon stated that they thoughthe was possibly an innocent vivtim of the S.D.since he strongly denied all the accusations.Hill-Dillon even went so far as to opposehis being sent to this country. This is onemore instance of the inability of the S.I(b)unit to handle cases of this sort. They haveneither the time nor the properly-trainedpersonnel to do the job. This is I thinkgradually sinking in since a few weeks ago wewere asked to send out 3 interrogators.Hart mentioned an ISOS message which indicatedthat a wireless operator on a ship which hadCatalogue Referencerecentlycalle Trigidad, was Likely tocommunicate with a German station in Spainvipresumably on matters relating to convoys.There are two Spanish vessels which leftTrinidad at the time in question.

During a conversation with thelatter the usual party line had been put over.The Russians were bearing the brunt of thewhole war. Their casualties were 6 millionagainst our 40,000. Why did we not open aSecond Front? Russia would settle the Polishaffair in herown way. It seems a great pityto me that it is usually the form not to hitback at the Russians when they make irres-ponsible statements of this kind. I am quitesure that it would pay us every time. If wemerely accept their statements they regard usas weak. I told Derbyshir that on the wholeI thought it soauld be as well if he did nonot meet these people since we have more orless agreed not to develop our connection hereiinrotder not to prejudice any relations thatC. and SOE may have in Moscow.Dick has put in a long note abdut the work doneby himseli, McDermot and Gwyer at COSSAC.It is a remarkable fact that when he went toCUSSAC not one siggle directive had been issuedtataisgye tataeeyeGretersneekvevessformaiionso formations on I.B.matters, and that within a month some 50 pagesof directives had gone out, every one of themwritten by Dick, McDermot or Gwyer. Evenbasic I.B.matters which might have been solvedby the W.O. years ago had to be thrashed out.Theworst feature of the whole business hasbeen the torpedoing by SS of the plans forcollating intelligence relating to Germanyand the set-up of the necessary machineryto feed a central intelligence bureau inYermany after the armistice. Gwyer in anextremely able memo sho'Ns how inadequate theexisting machinery is likely to be, &x thecommitment, which affects some 8norther depts.having been handed over to Section V, whosecontribution in the nature of things can onlybe a very small one. This decision, over-riding the views of all the other contri-butors, was taken after a uni-lateral discuss-ion between Whitefoord and C. without anyreference to Dick. +he question OW arisesas to whether we are going to sit down underthis. Dick suggests putting the whole matterto the J.I.C. Personally am doubtful aboutthe chances of success innless we can persuadeC that he is not adequately equipped tofulfil the responsibility that he has takenon. Alternatively we could wait untilWhiteley replaces Whitefoord and then reopenthe whole question.January 25thThe J.I.C. have given a resume of what theyonsider to be the forces at the disposal ofthe enemy to oppose a Second Front. On theassumption (a) that Overlord will be carriedcallognerefereheevkvt4he3appointed time, (b) thatAnvil will be carried out a few day s afterwards(c) that we are established on the Rimini-Pisa line, and (d) that Russian pressure onthe eastern front is maintained, it is thoughtthat Germany will be able to take into the-forces sufficient to make good wastage andto maintain the army at approximately thesame size as at the corresponding periodin 1943 though at the expense of quality.She will during the winter try to economisewith regard to the Luftwaffe and to refit anabuild up for the opening of the summer campaignas strong a defensive Air Force as possible.If the Russian offensive continues as atpresent and Germany is driven back to hereastern frontier, it is unlikely that she couldtransfer more than 5 divisions to the west.In the Mediterranean and .E. Europe she willhave to expect operations either in the Gulfof Genoa, the south of France and even in theBalkans, and will therefore be unlikelymaterially to reduce her land or air forces,although a few divisions might be spared.In Scandinavia, which is strategically Soimportant for Germany, she will have to maintaiher forces although she might recall 2 or3 divisions from Norway once the directionof our assault beca apparent. In Fance and t2 the years LOW Countries tied to maintain Germany a has strength during in the field lastformations of some 40 divisions in variousstages of training and of varying strengthand quality. At times part of this force hashad to be released to meet crises elsewhere.Realising the possibility of an invasion inthe West,Germany will aim at having a strengthCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19321in field formations of some 45 divisions, ofwhich some 13 may be offensive. On D-1 dayopposition to Overlord is likely to consistof 1 to 2 defensive divisions, reinforcedlater on the same day by 2 offensive divisionsIn addition there will be personnel Amountingthe static coastal and A.artillery. Makingno allowance for the delays imposed by alliedinterference or patriot activities, thisopposition might be reinforced by a further7 or 8 divisions by D plus 7. Reinforcementfrom outside France after the assault isunlikely to exceed some 10 divisions drawn asnecessary from Norway,Italy Balkans andCentral burope and also some 5 divisions fromthe Russi n Front if the situation there isnottoo desperate. In the air Germany mightmake immediately available a force of some1350 aircraft which might be reinforced byD plus 1 by some further 300 aircraft.German naval forces are likely to consist ofsome 15 destroyers and torpedo boats and a fleeof E.boats and mine laying craft. In additiona number of small submarines may be derailedfor channel operations. The reinforcementby Service forces after Overlord is likelyto be restricted to a few destroyers, torpedo-boats,mine-sweepers and other light craft.Ocean-going U-boats may give some assistance.I lunched with the Belgians. they are begin-ning to get together with but are stillrather in the air as to what they are expectedto do when the second front opens. Lepagementioned that there were a number of Belgianswho had passed through the LRC but who had atCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193one time or another served in the Germanforces. From the Belgian point of view theywere traitors, and the Belgians would like tosee them interned. I explained to him ourdifficulties, namely that even if we got anorder the man might well be subse uentlyreleased. His point is that when these peoplego back and come up for trial they will be ableto say that their case was investigated bythe British and they were left at large.L asked him to let me have a list of peopleto whom he referred. Brooke-Booth did notseem to know who they Nere SO presumably theyare just wandering about unchecked.Burt tells me that he has been asked by Mr.Justice Staple to go and see him.

Sincethe trial Burt has ascertained from MAPthat Cunliffe-Uwens is in a frightful mess.They have an overdraft of 1,300,000 since theycannot produce proper costing figures to theGovt. If this evidence could have beenproduced in count it would have torpedoedthat given by Sip Alexander Dunbar.January 26thWe have heard that a satisfactory meeting washeld at the Security Executive on the 15-milebelt. Brig. Mest made a Very moving speechfor the Ops side of COSSAC. He put forwardthree grounds, fir tly security,secondlyincrease of traffic and 3rdly the possibilityof bombing in the area prior to the operation.Findlater-Stewart was in the chair and inCatalogue Reference:KV/4/19323favour of the belt. The only opposition camefrom the H.O. and Ministry of Home Security,represented by Maxwell, Brown, News m and HoareNewsam and Brown remained in opposition but Max-well seemed more or less persuaded. He is stilhowever somewhat unconvinced on the securityside in spite of a meeting of all the C.O.S inthe area who have all by a large majorityvoted for the ban. Dick has drawn up a noten what he believes to be the real securityreasons. These are that the H.0. tend to relyrather on the police more than the citizencatching spies. The citizen will not be ableto play his part if the area is filled withlarge numbers of unknown touriests or visitors.If the ground is cleared of tourists anybodywho is not known locally is much more likelyto come te light, unless he is going to live inthe open fields, which he would find extremelydifficult. The whole question now has to goto the War Cabinet for a decision. The H.U.are L think extremely stupid in resisting theimposition of the ban in spite of the extremedangers with which aur armies are likely to befaced. Even if there is a half per centsecurity in the scheme any inconvenience to thepublic or anyone else should be disregarded.It is this kind of opposition which makes theServices regard the 1.0. as a lot of 5thcolumnists.Art Thurston came to tell me that he expectedto be off very soon and that his successwould be Joe Lynch who has up to now beenliaison officer in Ottawa with the RCMP.Ihad lunch with Lynch when L was in ttawa inCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1931942 and he made a very favourable impressionIf we have to lose Art we probably could notdo better.At the Wednesday meeting today Herbert dis-closed that ISOS indicated that the unidentifi-ed German agent BUNSEN, thought to be a Swiss,had left this country for Lisbon and Switzer-land somewhere round themniddle of January,where contact was to be made with anAbwehr representative from Berlin. This israther disconcerting since it means that wehave had a German agent here since Dec. 1942.We should howeer ber able to pin-point himendthe present evidence.Gogan said that Major HOLM of the NorwegianArmy, who is responsible for censorshipmatters had left with Francis two documentscontaining information of hirst-class impor-tance. One is a general description of Ger-man censorship practice in Norway and the otheris a translation of the German censorshipmanual of instructions concerningthe examina-tion and testing of all kinds of materialfor secret messges. E. la have obtainedadditional copies of these documents and alsoan appendix of inos less importance containingthe formulae of the secret writing tests usedby the Germans.Sclater mentioned that a P/W had said thatthe Germans were in the habit of listening toour commercial stations. Grogan said thatthere were 1000 commercial stations in thiscountry to the colonies and dominions and overCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193Ias100 to Northern Ireland, which were not monitorwith the exception of tthe press lines. Themilitary and the B.B.C. apparently have theirown lines. Googan is going to look into this.Sclater gave an account of the work by the vanson an American station which had been d.f.dby h.S.S. The station was at first thoughtto be a British military or Air Force oneS it was apparently using their procedure.The lansiwent out to the Horsham area wherethey got a very strong signal which did notoperate the needle. Another bearing causedthem to put the Bristol van out, which luckilyfound its target pretty qurkly. The pointof this story is that it almost impossibleto say more than that a wireless transmitteris in the north or south of England. Unlessyou can get into the ground-wave your vans don'toperate. To get into the ground wave youmay need to be very close to their target.There is still no inter-com between the vansand they cannot operate for more than hourswithout having to drive several hundred miles iin order to recharge their batteries. Notvery good show. Sclater is going to fird outwho is responsible for American Army signalsecurity.Stamp said that further evidence cast con-siderable doubt on the case of FRESSAY, who wasbeing run by TAR under the name of BOOTLE,in conjunction with the rench. an OSS agenthappened to meet FRESSAY and gave informationto the effect that his real n me was TIKHMANIEFa white Russian. This is now confirmed fromother sources, and links up with informationCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1939that FRESSAY may have been working for theGermans in N. Africa. There has also beenfurther evidence against FEYGUINE who has beeninterned in the 1.0:M: Both these casesmake one slightly apprehensive about FIDOand indeed about many other Frenchmen,Belgiansand Dutchmen who are off-loaded th ough theLTC on to the Allied Govts.Anthony tells me that through LEMON hehas ascertained almosteertainly that Bartlettis CERVELL'S ontact in the Bristol, AircraftCol We are taking steps accordingly.Victor has had a large number of reports aboutfires on troop ships and transports at Liver-pool,Birkenhead and Glasgow. In one casea device has been found, which is being for-warded to this office. It has been decided tosend a representative of B.5 to investigate.If these outbreaks are not accidental, theareas are suggestive of the I.R.AA report has been received of an explosionon one of our railways rather like a fog sig-nal. No damage was done but certain devicewere found which are usually attached to anS.O.E. railway clam. Also a crushed S.O.E."pencil". Two officers had apparently beenseen in the vicinity. This may be a case ofSOE testing their equipment, on the other handit is difficult to account foy the encil.Further enquiry is being made.Last night I had a long discussion with Victorand Theresa Clay about the Marita case. TheCatalogueReferereentv/4y99s that the Imperial127Fascist League is forming an inner councilof Sixsof which a Mrs. LEACH is one of themembers. I think this shows the value of thecase. I am sure that for the present itshould proceed on the same lines. There isno doubt that a prosecution is cout of thequestion both on technical and other grounds.JOB was condemned to death at the Old Baileytoday.January 27thGibbs came to see me about an official of thePetroleum Board called AULD, who committed agrave indiscretion by imparting to an officerhe met casuaily in theCumberland Hotel theinformation relating to our pipe lines speciallyconstructed for the Second Front. L got himto tell Cussen about the case from the Petrol-eum Board point of view. While they do notwish to minimise the gravity of the indiscretiorthey say that AULD is an extremely hard workerand at the present moment is quite indispensiblHe is a first-class engineer and is almostentirelyresponsible for the lines to thecoast and across the channel. They are alsoanxious if possible to avoid publicity whichwould give the impression that the Board weregrossly indiscreet. We explained to Gibbsthat this matter had come to us theough themilitary who took a very gravey view, since thedisclosure was of the highest military impor-tance. If we failed to prosecute in this casethey would say that soldiers were court-martialled and imprisoned for this kind of thing where-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19312%as civilians could get away with it. at thesame time we would explore the possibilitiesof getting a heavy fine rather than imprison-ment.I gather from Gibbs that our total consumptionof petrol in this country before the warwas roughly 5 million tons p.a. a. This is nowroughly the figure for the Air Force alone.Treasure's station has been heard againm butunfortunately it was not possible to de-codethis one either.Walker and TAR have been working on a XX pigeonracket. The suggestion is to get a number ofmoderately good English pigeons, take off theirEnglish rings and fit them With bogus Dutchrings as Norn by birds recently captured.These birds should then be taken over toHolland and released from an aircraft withoutparachute. Even if this were done at, nightit is likely that the majority of these birdswould, in time, from their wing-markings, bereported to the Wehrmacht authorities. Twopossibilities follow. The German loft men Vif they did not investigate too closely theserial number of the ring, would take thebird in as one of theirs and if eventuallythis bird were given to an agent who was tooperate from this country it would then mostlikely fly back to his Englishy home in steadof its adopted Dutch one which is a longerflight. In this way we would stand a chinceof intercepting a message which had been puton by an agent. Alternatively the GermanCatalogue ReferenCe:KV/4/193THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION093 (4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958pigeon men woutt tumbthe ideathat some of their birds were fakes and wouldbe obliged to check all their piegons, sortout the genuine ones and destroy the fakes.This quite possible might take a considerabletime and bother and if it was done at theright osychological moment it might just throwthom off their balance for sufficiently longte be extremely useful to us. The wings ofthe German piegons are stamped Wehrmacht.We should have asimilar stamp made.

It may bethat we should defer any action about MAY COCKuntil the decision about CERVELL has beenmade, since if we tuun out CERVELL it mayconveniently lead to the expulsion of MAYCOCKby the Swedes. C. has had a letter fromhis representative at Stockholm tellinghim about the indiscretions of POLLOCKabout CERVELLto MAYCOCK. Thiswas evidently what ledMAYCOCK to write such a stupid letter toCERVELL warning him to be more discreet.C. will now ask the Air Ministry for a copyof this letter and take the whole matter upon a fairly high level. Meanwhile we areconsidering what can be done about BARTLETTthe Sales Manager of Bristol Aircraft Co.He is notoriously indiscreet and we now know.from our own sources that CEEVELL regards himas his technical adviser on aircraft matters.It seems not unlikely therefore that he wasthe person who communicated the informationfrom the Bristol Co. about the Orion engineWe are considering whether he should not beQuestioned by Cussen and Buet. The matter ishowever somewhat complicated as the evidenceat the moment is by. no means conclusive.Lennox spoke to me about getting a ban placedon visits of all attaches to the area withinthe 15-mile belt. I mentioned it to narry andwe propose to put a note up to the JIC. tl isessential that the Americans should come intothataloghe Reference and 1ncidentally into any otherE 31efforts of the kind. Otherwise they are aptto make nonsense of the precautions we aretaking.January 29thI saw a photograph taken when H2S is inoperation. H2S reflects all perpendicularobjects,which come out in white. The smallestroups of buildings are shown up, and theshape of any particular town is easilyidentified.Certain Americans have been rather boastingabout the superiority of their night-fighterdevices and induced Cunningham, our ace nightfighter pilot to try them out on his macnine.The result of this experiment was ratherastonishing. Our own night fighters in theraid last Friday when some 90 odd came overbrought down 14 and Cunningham brought downnothing. Two others were brought down byAA fire.I took Dick's meeting. ISOS discloses thatthe S.D. in reporting f'rom Rome on ourispositions said that they had no informationeither from reliable or Abwehr sources.Herbert is still try ing to follow up theBUNSEN case. There is now some suggestionthat it may be purely notional,since Brandesthe controlling officer is putting up anotional agent to H.Q. in order that he canstay in Lisbon nd has also told Tricycle notto bring back any good information from thisallalogleReferencelkvtay93rolong the war.132Both ISAK and B.J.s indicate that the Germansare firmly of opinion that HELMUTH'S downfallwas due to intrigues beteen the Abwehr andthe S.D. in B.A. Herbert is strongly ofopinion that we shouldthese differen-ces by the publication of as much of theinformation that we have from 020 as possible.Stewart Hampshire of OSS is also very keenon this. We are going to work this up.Since the bomb explosion on a ship carry ingoranges from Ppain to this country there hasbeen an increasing campaign against theSpanish yovt. These of course have beencoupled with full dress protests to the F.O.The latest article relates to observationby German agents from Moroccan Spanish portson ships passing through the straits.We gave Thurston and Joe Lynch a B. .Divisonfarewell lunch at the Savoy which i thinkwas appreciated.Charles Cholmondeley came to see me about thecase of COATALEN This man is a Frenchfighter pilot who was brought down over Occ-pied Territory but succeeded in evadingand lying up with his rela ions from July 1942to Aug. 1943. The circumstances were consideredrather suspicious and although there was nodefinite evidence ag inst him it was felt thaton grounds of security he should be grounded.His French squadron-leader has now appealed agaagainst this decision. These cases areextremely difficult since if by any chanceCOATALEN was wrong and flew a plane to occupiedcataogueReferenee:k/4ig3e day and D.day, theTHIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT PETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION1333 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958. 2000consequences mignt be very serlous. I havepromised to review the case again. One of thepoints against COATALEN was that on hisreturn here he had applied to join SOE. Itnoy transpires that he heard of SOE throughsome fellow in the Air Ministry and thatit was from that quarter: that he receivedis advice.January 30thGenl Nordenskiold, heaof the Swedish Air Force, has told CERVELLthat he has recently had a visit from MAY COCKBritish hir Attache in Stockholm. MAYCOCKsaid that CERVELL was seeing much more of theEnglish, SO much SO that there was some anxietyin case they might tell him too much. Nordenskiold has therefore repeated his advice toCERVELL not to appear interested in anyoperational or strategical matters which areimportant for the British to keep secret, andwhich are of minor imporance from the point ofthe development ofSwedish air force. He haslso intimated to CERVELL that although theSwedes are naturally curious to find outwnere our invasion is to take place, this isa matter of relatively little importance toSweden, if it does not actually affect thatcountry. He thinks therefore it is unnecessarfor CERVELL to expose himself to suspicion bymaking enquiries on this point. His principalobjectives should be the state and developmentin technique and tacties, and such mattersas would appear reasonable to the British.Catalogye Rafetengek4e93y proper attitude,buit may have been written with a purpose134THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINBIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTIO3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDJanuary 31stACT 1958.DoooA.D.N.I. is heading a delegation to Washington.For 2 years an argument has been going onabout the grading of report. The main boneof contention is that the americans refuse tohave a "Most Secret" grade. They say thatif a thing is secret ik is secretand that anyhigher grade has no meaning. I gather thatthe main trouble in the Admiralty, with whomgrading is a matter of considerable importance,is that the American arrangement completelyupsets their filing system. Consequently after2 years a delegation has to cross the Atlanticand waste 5 weeks of valuable time.Peter Loxley is going to N.Africa at the endof this week, mainly to look into the wholeset-up in the French Intelligence system, whickis highly unsatisfactory.As arranged with David Boyle on Sunday, we sentin our paper about CERVELL to the JIC todayWe recommend that CERVELL should be removed butthat if the consequences are considered toograve owing to his close association withNordenskiold, it was suggested that an officerof fairly high rank from the Air Ministryshould go out to Stockholm, inforin Nordenskioldthat it had some to our knowledge that CERVELLhad been getting information of a secret kind frfrom one of our firms and generally poking hisnose too deeply into our affairs, that aCatalogue Reference:KVI4/193et135prosecution of certain officials of the firmwould probably ensue, that we hoped to keepCERVELL'S name out of it but that we shouldhave to insist in the future that no visitstake place. This would apply to all attaches,military,naval or air. We have also suggestedthat the Americans should be brought into lineon the highest possible level. The measuresneed cause no embarrassment to them since theycould say that as attaches were accreditedto the court of St.James, and not to the0. .Govt.. it was for the British to placewhat restrictions they thought fit.Foley and Drew-Brook came to see me and Milmoon the subject of Springbbek. Drew-Brook feelsrather under an obligation to the RCMP torelieve them of Springbock. We pointed outthat we did not wish to be unhelpful in any waybut that it would be extremely embarrassing forus to receive Springbock at this moment. Allsorts ofrestrictions both of vivil and militarypopulations were being imposed on grounds ofecurity. We could not very well leave Springbock at large, even if bhere was only a onepercent chance that he was wrong, - and hewould undoubtedly cause comment, since troopsXwere SO thick on the ground that there was noplace where he could be isolated. If welocked him up he would have a legitimate comp]aint owing to the conditions in which he hasbeen working for the last 3 years and it isnot unlikely that the .might feel obliged tCatafogere REferenceasp19gew-Brook bo put thisto commissioner Wood and to explain that it WaTHIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINED36IN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958.2dodonly on account of the treuendous importanceof secrecy in connection with future operationsthat made it necessary for us to request himto keep Springbock fop the time being.I gave an undertaking that we would receivehim here as soon as the crisis was over.I went to see Archie Boyle this afternoon.I explained to him that Sitreps had shown thatSOE were running fast motor-boats to Swedenfor the purpose of dcodlecting ball-bearings,thatCERVELL had some sortof means for exporting certain parts of air-craft which he had obtainedin this counteynnd that an agent of ourd had reported thatFlorInan of B.Transport was talking aboutsecret means for the export of goods throughParry of the British and Northern ShippingCo. These 3 things seemed to link up.Archie after talking to Wiskeman on the tele-phone told me that within the last l0 days anagreement had been reached between the Ministryor War Transport, Coleridge and Weston, and theSwedish Legation, by which the latter couldexport up to one ton of goods per ship ona charge of E400, sink or swim. This wasthe first that Archie had heard of thearrangement and he had no idea what securityprecautions were taken. He said he would beonly too ready to assist in any way he could.The obtaining of ball bearings from Swedenwas part of a general plan put up by SOE abouta year or 13 months ago. They suggested thatSchweinfurt and a factory near Faris makingGatalggurRfferenfakyiHergau out of action buta 37shatibh all-bearings for l8 months ahead. Theyfore this was done they should pre-emptobtained from the Treasury for this purposea grand of one million pounds, but they foundit impossible to get Harris of Bomber ommandto co-operate. Eventually they went to theAmericans who bombed Schweinfurt with consider-able effect. Harris said that Schweinfurtwould be an extremely difficult target to findInd, and had asked SOE to put in agents withbeacons through Switzerland. This they had beerunable to do. SOE have got out a considerablequantity of ball bearings and hope for a totalamannt of 500 tons during the winter months.They have only lost one MTB SO far. TheGermans are aware of what is going on andtheir boats are closely watched while inyothenburg. The whole business is of coursedone with the connivance of the Swedes. Thefact is also known to the Navy and to thenir Force who give air cover.February lstI am told thatSOE have information that Swedishfirms are supplying machinery to Germanyto replace that damaged in the Schweinfurtraid.I attended the JIC meeting this morning, whenour paper about CERVELL andanother one aboutgeneral restrictions on foreign attaches washeard. Cavendish-Bentinck was against anydrastic action against CERVELL but favouredthe plan of sending out an Air Force officerto see Nordenskiold. D.N.I. was in favour ofCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193138turning CERVELL out. Cavendish-Bentinckasked me whether I would be satisfied withthe alternative project. I said that as longas CERVELL was here we could not say thatthere was adequate security. Whatever repri-mand instructing he might a journalist/t get it would be report rather what like he sawand heard to his editor. On the other handI thoroughly understood the diplomatic diffi-culties and if the meeting felt they out-weighed the extra security that would begained by CERVELL'S removal, the proceduresuggested was obviously the next best thing.It was agreed that service attaches should berefused leave to visit within the 15-mile belt,and at Cavendish-Bentinck's suggestion theF.O. will be consulted about extending this banto other neutral diplomats The americansare to be brought in line with this policyand also with the policy of closing downentirely on all visits to factories, aero-dromes, dockyards,militar camps etc.The D.G. called a meeting of mysel,Dick and Ha]Harry to discuss the position as regards theSecond Front and ourdifficulties with SIS.It was agreed that we should seek the co-opera-tion of the new M.G.In Int. Whiteley, who hastaken over from Jock Whitefoord and that sincethe question of the Bureau was coming up beforethe J.I.C. for ratification we should then raisethe point about the preparation of the informa-tion and the rear echelon. I pointed out toHarry that the J.I.C. wa.s in some ways perhapsnot the best forum for this discussion, sinceCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193139nobody would know much about the question andC. would stress the necessity for the informatioto be prepared in his office owing to itsgreat secrecy. Harry said that he wouldsee that the D.M.I. was carefully briefed.J.C. tells me that there is a warning out forCelery's arreat for embezzlement. Celery hasapparently disappeared.Findlater-Stewart's committee on the securityof Overlord has decided that there is no in-superable objection to the imposstion of aban on travel between Gt.Britain and relandSo far as the civil depts. are concerned,though it will probably be impossible to pre-vent some adverse effect on the supply ofIrish labour. This opinion is subject to thefollowing conditions! (a) that a similar banis placed on service leave, (b) that no attemptis made to select Irish immigrant labour forspecial treatment, (c) that provision is made forIrish labour desirous of employment in Gt.Brit-ain to have free entry, (d) that arrangementsare made to prevent any interference with ourcattle imports, (e) that special arrangementsare made for members of the merchant serviceon whichs which dock for a few days at portsin Gt.Britain or N.reland to visit theirfamilies any ywhere in the U.K.,(f that it ismade clear when the ban is announcedthat itis a temporary measure and is required forreasons of military security in connection withthe launching of our offensive.IfthebaniisCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193imposed it is recommended (1) that not morethan 24 hours notice should be given but thatprovision shoudd be made for exembtion in thecase of civilians who have already obtainedexit permits, and all Irish workers who are dueto take their prescribed holiday, to leave upto 10 days bfter the ban is put on. 12) theban should not be imposed until Easter andnot too long before the operation is due tostart.ISOS discloses that the Germans are gettinghold of American uniforms.Burt tells me that both HOYES and CHEOWNthe Secretary of unliffe Owens, have been dis-missed, and that the company s for sale.

Therewere 12 cases of serious abuse of the ordresde mission the other day. A party of Frenchmenadmitted that the ordres de mission were oldones. Obviously the whole system is quitemeaningless.Herbert lectured to the americans, His notesare to be roneod and distributed to certainofficers of G. 2. L have read them and theyCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193rutcontain nothing in the way of information thatwe could not have obtained from people at 020.Dennis Page tells me that the informationsupplied to him about Garbo's code was of theutmost value. Before he received this codehe was working entirely in the air and saysthat it is quite doubtful whether he wouldhave ever got on to the right lines. Once hehad the system he knew that all his energieswere going in the right direction, and he wasable to solve the code in about 5 months.It covers Huelva, ,Barcelona, San Sebastian,Cadiz, Melilla and a number of other stations.February 2ndAt the weekly meeting Herbert mentioned thathe had not been able to make any further pro-gress with the case of BUNSEN. He had examinedthe cases of all Swedes but none of them fittedthe facts. He was beginning to think thatBUNSEN might well be notional.Milmo mentioned that a P/TI had been capturedin Italy who had formerly been employein the Abwehr registry in Berlin. He hadalready given information to the effect thatJOHANSEN who was mixed up in an SOE case andwas captain of a boat plying between thiscountry and Norway, nas a XX, and also GULBRAND)SEN. It is satisfactory to find th t we hadreached a similar conclusion and that thisman had not mentioned anyone of whom we hadno knowledge. Efforts are being made to getthis P/M sent here for further interrogation.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193There is a proposal to extend the BOAC nirService to Madrid. This presents a counter-sabotage problem on which Victor is makingrecommendations.Jock Whyte has produced a story obtained froman American evader,t. Robert Grimes. Thisofficer brought back a message from one "Lily"in Brussels. She wished to draw attentionto Col.Kennedy who was connected withIntelligence or sabotage and who was said tobe stationed in London. Lily did not knowwhether he was good or bad. She also mentioneda German in London whose name was given as vanMURCK who was said to be connected with Col.Kennedy in some way and to be sending messagesto Belgium by wireless. grimes said furtherthat van MURCK'S messaged opened with thewords "On demande le cheval de bois". Grimessaid he thought the messages were sent overaround 9 pm as they were sent when the BBCnews was on. He did not know the wavelength.He stated that he was merely conveying themessage that had been given him and that hehas no further details. The message wasgiven in writing to Lily by the Chief inBrussels. Lily and the Chief are said to beknown to Major Langley.Victor rang up to say that he had just dismant-led a bomb found in a case of onions atKettering. This bomb consisted of a numberof blocks of TNT and two German time clocksenclosed in plastic. Oving to some mechanicaldefect the clocks had stopped, but on gettinga bump in course of transit from the docksCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193143one of them had re-started and would have goneoff in 7 days. Meanwhile Hope has been ringingup f'rom Newcastle. He says that the U. C. isslightly annoyed that he was never told aboutthe explosions in the orange ships Stanhopeand Hay old. He is worried about some 3,000cases which are still on the quay and alsoabout the remaining 7,000 cases which have biwbeen distributed throughout the UK down toretailers. He was thinking of communicatingwith H.0. in order that all these cases couldbe teaced and ripped open. L told him tocalm the C.C. down since we had reason to thinkthat there would be no further explosions(ISOS had disclosed that there were 5 bombs.3 went off on the Stanhope and one on theHaywood. The discovery of the 5th thereforeaccounted for them all). I told Hope that hecould also tell the C.C. that the chances ofany more bombs going off now was remote owingto the time factor, and that in any case the pupublic-ha been warned in the Press and woulddoubtless report any suspicious circumst tancesto the police.TAR tells me that Gen.Bedell-Smith, LisenhowerChief of Staf'f, has given Wild carte blanchefor the formation of an "A" force for theSecond Front. This seems to indicate thatthe deception unit which we shall be supplyinwith officers will be an entirely separateorganisation vith full establyishment.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193Burt came totell me that there had been acertain amount of trouble with S.B. over theAULD case. Canning had evidently complainedto Kendal that this was a matter that ought tohave been handled by S.B. It was decided to.let S.B. serve the summond.Walter Bell tells me that he lunched todaywith a ol.Carter of G.2. and Viv. Col. L.Carterproduced out of his pocket the roneoedsynopsis of Hart's lecture on the Abwehr.He said "I suppose this is being done by yourpeople'?" Viv. on looking at thedocumentsid that the course was being given by usalthough of course there was much in thedocument which pertained to the work of hisorganisation. I am rather expecting a crythat the productionn of this document consti-tutes a grave breach of security. In facthowever there is not one single word in it whiccould not have been obtained from informationwhich we have received from our own sourcesquite independently of ISOS.We have an interesting S.D.case from theMiddle East A man who originally gave hisname as Van der LINDE was apprehended. Hefinally confessed that he was a Germun n med HaHans MERZ, entrusted with a mission from theS.D. to establish contact with Poles in theMiddle East. He is supposed to be coming froma Polish resistance organisation believed to beunder German control. The probability is thatin fact he was engagedeto SOW discord amongstthe Poles and to undermine their confidencein their ressstence organisations. He wouldcataloguevrReferefce.kevpanrssrate other Polishresistence organisations.Lennox has just come in with a minute fromthe P.M. who wishes to turn out all hostileLegations in Eire. This minute was handed bythe P.M. to 1smay, from Ismay to the Chief's ofStaff, f'rom the Chiefs of Staff to the JIC,the J.I.C. to the ISSB who handed it toLennox who gave it to me. It reached me at0.30 with a request for a full memo tobe submitted to the JIC by 7. to be embodiedin their paper to be discussed by the Chiefsof Staff at 10. O tomorrow. The Chief's OfStaff were to advise the P.M wh would dealwith the question at the Cabinet meeting onFriday.The PM began by saying that he was increasing-ly concerned by the danger of leakage to Over-lord f'rom the German and Jap Legations inDublin. He did not appear to be aware of theremoval of the German minister's ireless setor of his methods of communication, which areunder control. In his view a demand should bemade by ourselves and the US separately thatthe German and enemy legations should besent away forthwith. If Dev.refused then weshould ask that the legations should be searched for wireless, that wireless messages shouldno longer be allowed, and that we should ifneed be put a blockade on southern Irelandand prevent any vessel or aircraft leaving.He wanted to know whether this was possible.He felt sure we had a duty to the lives of oursoldiers and we ought not to be behind handwhen the US themselves were pressing in aCatalogue Reference:KVI4/193matter of this kind against the hostile gangsin Dublin. It seemed to him that the Americarmust be supported in their demands for theexpulsion of the hostile legations. The Chiefsof Staff were asked to prepare a paper (a)setting out the present position as regardsenemy nationals, wireless and cy phers in lre-land,(b) evaluating the risk to the securityof Overlord resulting from (a), and (c) put-ting up proposals as to what steps shouldbe taken. to eliminate the above risk, withparticular reference to the PM'S minuteand suggestion that the Legations should beremoved. In the absence of Cecil and most ofthe staff who had gone home, I got out a draftpaper which L discussed With Capel-Dunn at theJIC. We jointly prepared a note for theJIC to hand to the Chiefs of Staff. We gavea statement of the position with regard tocommunications,emphasising that there Nas 5 or6 days delay on any thing that leit bublin andthat the informatio was controlled; that therisk of leakage from ublin was less seriousthan the possibilities of teakage from Londonthrough neutral emb issies and that the closingdown of the German legation would to alarge extent le tve us in the dark as to what ainformation was going out and how.Weshouldnot be able to prevent the Germans eom attemp-ting to establishing other wireless channelswhich we might not detect, and we might losethe co-operation of the Eire authorities.Lastly we should lose the valuable deceptionchannel thewaugh which we had already planted4 messages.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193147February 3rdVictor and L went to see indlater-Stewartabout the possibility of making some announce-ment to the Press on the subject of bombswhich might be found in cases of oranges andonions. This seemed necessary as ll sortsof bodies, Home Guard,Police etc. were givinginstructions that cases should be set aside.This would mean that the goods would rot.Findlater-Stewart saidthat in case of thissort you never quite knew whether in additiona large number of other bodies it might noteven be necessary to consult the Archbisnopof Canterbury. He thought however that ameeting should be called between ourselves,the MOI, MWT and Ministry of Food. L dulyattended this meeting at 3.15. it was suggestethat subject to confirmation by the Ministryof Food, whose representativr did not feel quitsure of himself, ve should say that 5 bombshave been traced to the Stanhope and Hey old,that in view of the lapse of time no furtherexplosions were expected, ind that 10 shipshad since arrived vithout any untoward incidentIf however anything suspiciouswas seen, itshould be reported to the police. The publicshould be assured that the bombs were in thecases and not in the oranges OF onions.I lunched with Drew-Brook, the SIS man inCanada. He talked lot about the risingFrench-Canadian population. The Britidhpopulation was now only 43% of the totalpopulation. French Canadians were not inter-ested in either ourselves or the Americ ns.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/193u'Fundamentally their view was that they had beerthe original occupants of Canada, and that theyshould govern the country. Drew-Brook thoughtthat they would be well on the way to doing thisifthe British did ot wake up to the fact.His idea was that in view of the tr mendousCanadian effort in the industrial field,ship-building, armaments etc., the Britishshould go in for a policy of industrial-isation and should start up branch factoriesin Canaa hich would trade with South Americaand the East. He thought this would be betterthan an extensive emigration for agribulturalpurposes. He has discussed this matter withLord Selbourne who he found slightly unsympa-thetic Selbourne's view is that the uovt.could not very well take this up and it mustbe left to private enterprise. He is overgoing to think the matter over,At 4.30 I attended a meeting with Victor atthe JIC, there Cavendish-Bentinck wished toknow how we assessed the risk of sabotage.Ismay had produced a paper showing that some 3432,000 military police of one kind or an-other were employed on guarding places ofimportance. He thought this number wasexcessive. We said that even if there were nosabotage risk we did not feel that the numbersat present employed were more than adequateto maintain security against yOspionuge, leakageof information and pilferage. AS regardssabotage, we said that the risks by residentsaboteurs were negligible but from D.30 up toD.day the chances OI saboteurs being para-Catalogue Reference:KVI4/1931y4chuted into this country could not be neglecteThe number odf targets which were suitablefor attack by secret saboteurs and thedestruction of which would have a significanteffect on Overlord, was small. The SecurityService had arranged to issue necessary ins-tructions regarding counter-measures to thoseresponsible for thr security of the installa-tions which are considered vulnerable andliable to attack from secret saboteurs.I said risks to Overlord from espion ige, parachy-tists etc was a far graver matter than therisk from sabotage agents.Brook-Booth and Furnival-Jones came to see meabout over a thousand allied nation ls atpresent in Stockholm whom the americans wishedto get over to train as airmen. They proposedto get these men over at the rate of about 175a week by special Liberators. I said thatfor security they should all go through theLRC provided the LRC could handle them:We should like if possible to have advanceinformation. I told Furnival-Jones to dis-CUSS the matter with Dick who would speak toBaxter.February 4thIn"Justice of the Peace and local governmentReview) of Jan. 15th 1944, there appears anextremely interesting articleyentitled "AgentProvocateur". I am told that it was writtenby hawson Walton of the D.P.PPos office inconsultation with the D.P.I. LO set a trapfor someone reasonably suspected of indulgingcatalogueReference.kv:4/193 conduct which has been(50hasvbeen approved by the court of CriminalAppeal (R. W.Pickley 2 C LAR 53) and suchconduct has been commended under para. 5 of thereport of the Legal Commission on PolicePowers and procedure of March l6th 1929, whereafter an exhaustive review of the merits anddemerits of such action the committee recom-mended "as an exception to the general ruleparticipation in offences may be resorted toby the police in cases where there is goodreason to believe that the offence is habitual:ly committed in circumstances in which ob-servation by a 3rd party is ex hypothesiimpossible". Two essential elements arenecessary to distinguish the conduct of anofficer properly making an investigation intocrime from that of an agent provocateur.Firstly the officer must have reasonablegrounds to be ieve that the suspected personis habitu lly committing a certain class ofcrime. The test of the genuineness of thisbelief rests as in all cases in whicha genuine belief is an essential element,upon the facts disclosed to the officer priorto his taking action. If his informationis such that reasonable belief is justifiedthen it is his duty to be prepared to par-ticipate in the crime in order toobtainevidence which would wouldlead lead to the convictionof the offender. The agent provocateurhowever goes on less well-substantiated sus-picion. He wishes to provoke crime and withthis object in view will approach anyone whomhe thinks will be a likely victim. Thesecond essential element lies in the conductCatalogue ReferenCe:KV/4/193of the officer after he has contacted thesuspect. It is essential that he "acceptsthe suspect's answer. He must not in the evenof a refusal to participate in a criminalaction hold out an inducement. He has sprungthe trap and the trap has failed, and SO faras that enquiry is concerned he must considerit concluded. There is no reason why at alater stage, if information is fortheomingthat the offence is continuing, a furthersimilar attempt to obtain evidence could notbe attempted. The Agent I rovocateur will, asthe term implies, attempt to induce a suspectto commit a crime after his first refusalby holding out the hope of reward or othermeans. Such conduct could not be too severelycondemned if it were adopted by a policeofficer or other investigating authoity.The state of the officer's mind prior tocontacting the suspect is a question of factand can be proved by the information in hispossession which induced him to adopt thisparticular line of enquiry. The offencemust in all cases be such that detection byordinary methods of outside observation isimpossible.I had frequent conversations with Jane and C.on the subject of a note giving the pros indconS in favour of the expulsion of hostilelegations from Eire. It was thought desirableto have this short note for presentation tothe P.M. if, as was expected, he wished toconsult C. and the D.G. before meeting theCabinet. As we received no such call beforeCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1931621 pm L suggested to C. that he might like tosend a copy of this note to the P.M. throughBridges or any other appropriate channel.I had a talk with Anthony. I have asked himto look into the question of F.O. telegramswhich has become of increasing Importance inregard to affairs in the Mid East, particularlyPalestine.C. tells me that the P.M. has withdrawnall copies of the JIC memo on the expulsionof hostile legations from Dublin. we does notknow the reason but is trying to find out.February 5thCanaris gave an order two days ago that therewas to be no more sabotage in Spain untilfurther notice. It seems therefore that ourrotest to the Spanish Govt. has borne fruit.Spain has clearly got rather nervous abouther position and there is considerablecomment in their newspapers about the americandecision to cut off oil sup lies. The F.U.are consequently getting a. bit nervous andhave refused to allow any announcement tobe made in the press about the oranges andonions. The Ministry of Food are also againstthis as they made a rather premature announce-ment some time ago in which they said theyhad examined all the cases and found no explo-sives. In fact they did arrange for theNaval Bomb Disposal Squad to probe the casesbut this was a totally inadequate way ofdiscovering the bombs. The result is thatCatalpgueeferencet.kvi4nigsging up wanting to$3know whether they should rip open the casesor put them aside for inspection. Informationabout the discovered bomb at Kettering isnow fairly widespread.I asked Caroe to find out from ZECH whathe thought about the Katyn murders. ZECH wasin the German army when they marched into theparts of Poland which the hussians hadoccupied. He says that there is absolutelyno doubt that when the German Army arrivedthe Poles welcomed them as iberators,despitethe fact that the Poles have no love for theGermans. Their hatred of the Russians isconsiderable, and the latter had treated themduring the months of occupation with greatcruelty. ZECH gives as examples the largenumbers of all classes of the populationwho were deported to European Russia, chieflyArchangel and Siberia for heavy labour. InLembueg the population was made to parade infront of the Russians and show their hands.Anyone whose hands indicated that they wereunused to manual labour was deported. No oneshown any consideration.. He says this is afact and not just rumour. The Russians alsotreated all P/Ws, especially Polish officers,shamefully. At the time when Smolensk felland when, according to ECH,/Officers wereprobagby murdered, Sikorski was in Moscow andthe Russian-Polish Treaty was being signed.Had the Hussians taken these P/WS with them whethey retreated, they would have suppliedSikorski with plenty of evidence of hussiancruelty and ill-treatment, and would haveCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193suopposed a Russian-Polish alliance. On theother hand had the Russians let these officersfall alive into German hands, they would haverun the risk of their being used by theGermans for propaganda purposes against theRussians. This might have prevented thetreaty from being signed. ZECH is convincedthatt: tthese Polish P/W in anything like suchnumbers fallen into German hands he would haveheard of them, and that they would have beeshown to the Red Cross as evidence of Russiancruelty. The Germans were extremely keento impress upon their soldiers the sort oftreatment they could expect if they fell intoRussian hands, SO as to make them fight tothe bitter end. When the Russo-Polish Treatyhad been signed, the Russians flooded Polandwith leaflets dropped from planes informingthe population of the Treaty. The Germanswere anxiously looking round for good propagandand these officers would have been usefulhad they been available. He thinks thetit is unlikely that the Germans would havecaptured the officers alive and murdered themat some later date, but he does not excludethe possibility that certain Polish P/Wssubsequently merdered by the Germans mighthave been put into the same graves.ZECHwhoof course is well disposed towards the Poles,is very anti-Bolshevik, but he is quite willingto admit that both the Gestapo and the S.S. S.would have been capable of executing largenumbers of Polish P/W. In fact he knows theyare guilty of worse crimes against thecivilian population. His view of the wholenncident is based on the fact that PolishCatalogrsRetereneeueva1ggeate by the lussians15yand as such, if captured alive, by the Germans,would have been of great value for propagandapurposes.February 7thHarry and L went over to the JiC in order toassist in the drafting of Cavendish-Bentinck'spaper on sabotage risks in the UAK. Ismayhas asked for this report in conneetion withthe man-po er situation. Harry stressed thepoint that the 32,000 police employed at var-ious establishments had many other duties toperform whi h included such things as preven-tion of leakage of information due to an illicientry, protection f secret teials and secretweapons which might give important informationregarding future operations, unauthorised entryor departure f'rom U.K. K. at certain points,interference with dispersed ircraft by smallboys, police control within large establishmentsand lastly the prevention of large-scalepilferage. We agreed that the negligible scaleof German sabotage in this country mhitherto,the lack of evidence of sabotage plans, theapparent lack of suitably trined personnel andthe great difficulties inherent in theinfiltration of the necessary agents, led us tothe conclusion that the risks of effectivesabotage in the U.K. were SO small as not toconstitute a menace to the war effort. Suchdanger as there was must be anticipated mainlyin the area connected with the mounting ofOverlord, where special precautions ould benecessary at certain selected points.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19359Brooman-hite told me a few days ago thatroughly a dozen spies habe been caught inItaly by our patroIs, either try ing to land insmall boats or coming through the lines.We had a meeting here with Peter Reid, lilenn.his Signals Security officer, Maltby, M-ETAR, Kellar and Sclater, to discuss the Sir lsSecurity in Mid East. reter told us that therecommendations Of the Chiefs of Staff call(ing all Allied Govts. to submit to thevetting of their cyphers and the adoptionof cussion our procedure in Washington was at and present likely under to receive dis-approval. When this has been done, there willbe a joint Anglo-Americar re quest addressedto all Allied Govts. This should considerablimprove the position. Meanwhile the letterwritten by Joe Stephen'son in Mid East had atleast disclosed that SIME, seinterestsxinSignals Security was some hat similar to ourown, was very much in the dark. There seemedto be a number of sets transmitting and nobodyquite knew whether they were authorised or not.Doth Wilson and Peter delivered quite a sharpattack on Maltby, who what ever his meritsmay ber never fails to radiate dishonesty.C, accepts full responsibility for clandestinetraffic by the Poles and Czechs and the posi-tion as regards Poles has recently been impro-ved by a deman for their cyphers. This hasbeen done on a high level in order that we cansay to the Russians that we have knowledge ofthe communica tions of the Poles with theirresistance organisations and that theseorganisations are not being used to operateCatalogtetRefereneekv4/193at seems really$6that RSS in the Mid East should work incloser co-operation with Signals 9 who arenow responsible there for signals security.It would of course be ideal if there was somesort of unit responsible for keeping an eyeon allied signals in Mid East. This shouldlogically be done by Sigs. but they have SOmany other duties and such a big job in keepingtheir own signals in order that it is doubtfulwhether they are covering the allied groundas well.Wilson seemed very venomous against C. He wasanxious to know exactly where all the troublelay and what the relations were between SIME andSiS and ourselves and SIS. I explained theposition as best I could, and pointed out thatalthough we are ultimately responsible forleakage of information in this countey, wehave no control over the machinery. Ne canonly draw attention to a state of affairson the basis of information received. Wehad in fact done this on information obtainedfrom two Abwehr officers. SIME Nere in verymuch the same position as ourselves.OI had a meeting with ick,Hale Cheney Baxterand Milmo to discuss Milmo's report expressinganxiety about doubtful characters passingthrough the LRC. My attention was drawn tothe case of NEUKERMANS amd also to that ofFRESSAY. The former had a good cover storyand was extremely skilful under eross-examina-tion. He was later denounced by WY CKAERT andbrought back. He has since confessed not onlythat he got his secret ink through the LRCand communicated with the Germans but that heCatalogue Reference:kV/4/19311had other means of communication if all othersbroke down, i.e. transmitting from an aircraftin flight. NEUKERMANS is a Belgian and atrained pilot. The case of FRESSAY is equallyserious. He was being run by the French inconjunction with ourselves as a D. A. and wassleeping with a woman working for Vaudreuilof the F'rench 2eme Bureau. It was decidedthat Milmo and I should see Maxwell and seek hisco-operation in asking the F.O. to support ofin refusing admission to aliens abroad duringthe next 3 or 4 months. If he agrees to thiswe can put up a paper showing proposals forthe diversion of Belgians to the Longo, French-men to .Africa, Poles and as many othernationals as possible to Mid East. This wouldbe aandledy by an F.O. note to each of theallied governments in question. If the H.O.did nat come into line on thus we should haveto impress upon them the necessity for lockingup all doubtful cases which may amount to some-thing like 100 a month.I spoke to Sir John Stephenson at the D.O.about the P.M.S proposal that the Lire ovt.should tuun out the hostile legations in Dublinand I have also seen Cecil who has justreturned from Eire. The history of thismatter is rather a long one. The Nife ofDavid Grey, the American Minister in Dublin,is the aunt of the President's wife. Somemonths ago Grey drafted a rather stupid letterto Dev. in which he advocated' that we shouldhuve the use of ports and airfields in Eire.He showed this to the T resident when on a visitto the White House which took place during theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/193158PM'S visit to the States. The letter had bythat time been considerably watered down bythe State Dept. The PM sent a copy of it tothe Cabinet and said that he would like todiscuss it on his return. He subsequentlyhad a considerable battle with Cranbournewho put forward the very sound argument thatDev might make it a condition of such a concess.ion that we should agree to a union betweenDrth and south. We should then, if we refused,be open to bhessure by the Americans becausewe were standing in the way of their plan, whichthey argued was in the general interest ofallied security and the war effort. Cranbourneview eventually prevailed, much to the annoyanceof David Grey who then set his mind to gettingthe hostile legations kicked out of Dublin.The PM therefore feels himself in a ratherweak positionnvis-a-vis the USA and is anxiousto meet their wishes. He considered theJIC paper compiled by Capel-Dunne and myself.Although it caused him a certain amount ofirritation ne eventually agreed that the projectcould not be pressed on security grounds. Thepaper I think makes it fairly clear thatsecurity might well be better served by lea-ving the hostile legations where they are.It has however been decided to allow theAmeticans to proceed on their own. Later weshall say that we concurred. Nobody expectsfor one moment that Dev will agreebut theAmericans will make political capital out ofthe incident since they will beable to say thatthey did everything they could to safeguard thelives of their citizens in forthcoming opera-tions but that the Eire Govt. refused to listenCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1935aThis may have a considerable effect on the Irishvote in the fortheoming eresidential elections.Meanwhile Cecil had conversations in ublinwith Mackenna the hief of Staff and also withLiam Archer. It has been discovered that thepassports of the to irish parachutistsO'REILLY and KENNY bear a forged visa andsignature purporting to be those of the EireLegation in Berlin. Theee documents seemto constitute a serious indictment against theGerman Govt. and Liam Archer thinks that theycould be used with considerable force in ademand for the removal of the egition, andthe severance of diplomatic relations. Cecilthinks that if the matter were properly approa-ched it might be possible to get the Eireauthorities to take the action required bythe Americans on their own. In one way thismight be good but if we feel that security isbetter served by leaving the legations inDublin the present suggestion of an approachby the Americans, which is almost certain tomeet with refusal, Nould perhaps be the betterone. Personall L think itwould be disastrousifthe Eire Govt. broke off their relationsat our instigation since they would thencome to us and ask for armaments,for theirprotection. These armaments would thenpeobably after the war be used against us ina battle between north and south.The D.G. showed Me a minute from the PM toFindlater Stewart in which he says that he isnot convinced about the necessity for theCatalogue ReferenCe:KV/4/193160creation of a 15-mile belt and a visitors ban.He argues rather loosely that such a ban canonly be justified on security grounds which heconsiders to be very slender. He thinks that.there is as much to be feared from the residentslaan from the visitors. He does not believe inthe dangers of dislocation through bombardmentand in the ensuing traffic congestion. He wantsto have a list of special points in the 15mile belt area entry to which in the opinionof the Chiefs of Staff would constitute a realmenace. What he does not understand of courseis that if the area is thickly populatedwith holiday-makers, the spy is unlikelytostand out. Clearly residents are known to eachother and to the police and with a visitorsban the spy might well be detected by either.There is also the point that if we knew thatan undesirable person was going down to thearea, we shad have no means of precentingthe visit. Lastly if visits within the 15 milebelt are to beallowed there is a greater mancethat details about impending operations willreach neutral attaches.February 8thI had a talk with Grogan and Anthony about thestaggering of diplomatic cables prior toOverlord. Censorship have put forward asuggestionthat diplomatic missions here shouldbe informed that ora date to be specified theirtelegrams will be subject to 3 or 4 days delay.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193(b\Each mission Nould be given to understand thatthere were ceetain other missions which mightbe sending out operational information butthat they of course were in no way suspect fromthat point of view. The alternatice methodwhich is the one we prefer is to graduallyincrease delays up to the time of Overlordon grounds of shortage of staff. These groundwould only be given if we were challeneged,it would not be possible to plead that thelines were congested since the operators atthe other end would know that this was false.Grogan is going to get Herbert's approvalof our proposals and we will then have a meetingwith Censorship, David boyle and G.C & C.S.since the latter will be asked to organise rishservices during the last 2-3 weeks. During thatperiod we should be sending out nothing thathad not been read except on lines which couldnot be dealt with. This latter categoryunfortunately includes two of the most danger-ous, namely the Swedish and opanish.At the D.G.S meeting I explainedthe line we areproposing to take with air A. Maxwell abouta wider interpretation of 12(5/a and the diver-sion of as many allied nationals to the BeigianCongo and Mid East as possible.On 5.2.44 the information rre CROSSBOW was asfollows: 97 sites have been found by air photo-graph and the total number is not likely to bemore than 120. It has not been possible todeduce any consistent repair policy from photo-graphs of bombed sites but it appears that someCatatogue ReferseeekV4/93eth ther and that an162 16 2average of about 10 days is needed for organisatof repair work before repair and reconstructionwork begins. Craters on bomb sites are oftendeliberately left unfilled in order to createthe impression that a site has been abandoned.It is thought unlikely that the Germans willlaunch BROSSBOW during the next 4 weeks. Theabsence of small guage railway installationsnar ski-sites led to the conclusion that anorganisation existed for receiving suppliesby rail and su sequently delivering them byroad to the operational sites. Photographinterpretations now disclose the existence ofcertain sites which have certain common featuressuitable for use as supply-sites Each ofthe supply sites oomprises a number of standar-dised buildings together with other buildingsof various patterns consisting of pre-castconcrete blocks. They are all heavily defendedbyflac. The farthest advanced of these supplysites is at Valognes in the Cherbourg peninsula.As regards the palotless aircraft, it appearsthat the Germ ns have not yet succeeded in gettiouey thing to work correctly at the same time.S- the main features of the missile that haveeach functioned well independently were to worktogether at the S me time, the resultingperformance would cause 40% of the numberlaunched to land in an area equivalent to greaterLondon. T'he Germans may shortly be able toachieve this combined performance in theirtrials.Operational performance of a comparable standardwould presumably take longer. They must ofcoursedre depend on the efficacy or otherwiseCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1931bsof our bombing of the sites. A particularlylarge site in in process of construction atWizernes, and is heavily defended by flak.Photographs taken on Jan. 21st show that the-constructio of the circular emplacementis still at an early stage and could not begreatly damaged by bombing.February 9thMilmo and L went to see maxell and suggestedto him that we should jointly approach the F.0.ith a view to their preventing as many alliednationals as possible from coming to thiscountry during the next few months. We alsoasked dor a wider interpretation of 12(5)awhich would enable us to lock up any thing up to100 a month unsatisfactory cases. We undertookto review these cases at about D plus 30.Maxwell was extremely sympathetic He saidthat he would write to C dogan and suggest ameeting between the F.O.,Moylan and ourselves.He seemed amenable to the suggestion that 12(5/ashould be more widely used for unsatisfact ctorycases. We explained to him in some detail orour anxieties due to the case of NEUKERMANS,and L think he was impressed with the importanceof the whole matter.theAt the weekly meeting today Hart mentioned thecase of the seamen illian HEAP who had offeredhis services to the Germans, and had been put ina Spanish prison. HEAP h has now been broughtback to this country, but has SO far not comeclean. He is a poor type aged about 19.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193164Hart also mentioned the Case which was beinginvestigated by Seeds. It concerns aBQACpilot who has been carrying letters for a womanat ly the to her sister in Lisbon. Her sisteris of Irish extraction, married to a Portuguese,and anti-British. Though there is not necessari-ly any thing particularly sinister in this caseit does show that pilots carry letters. I havesuggestedto D.4 that they should look intothis matter and see what ean be done about snap-searches both of aircraft and crews. This wouldat least act as a deterrent. Another interest-ing feature of the case is that the Portuguesehusband is interested in the purchase of coffeeand its resale to Germany. Coffee is one ofFidrmuc's main interests and Fidrmuc frequentlyrenders reports which he says he gets from aBOAC pilot. Fidrmuc is just leaving for Barce-lona and h is been given the lron Cross, presumably as a reward for the volumes of inaccurateinform tion that he has been supplying to theAbwehr. He is of course a protege of anaris.Milmo raised a rather grave issue re Censor hipas disclosed by the case of NEUKERMANS, whosent out twoletters to a cover address whichwas on the I.B.list. It was thought by somethat at inyrate the addresses on the I.B.listwhich are covered from our own sources mightbe included in the Security List Without verymuch danger. The .B.list is to be scrutinisedfrom this point of view when we would havea further discussion with Grogan,Milmo and TAR.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/19316DJock Why te referred to the case of an escapedprisoner called BERTRAM on whom certain doubtshave been thrown by other retuened P/Ws. I amextremely uneasy about the present arrangementsfor the interrogation of escapees and evaders. anhave spoken again to Milmo. His memo on thissubject had been held up pending ceetain examplewhich were to be supplied by Jock. I think theris sufficient data to go ahead with M.I.9 Nithouthese examples and L propose to get ockattover and discuss the whole question. it isof course quite insane that M.I.9's activitiesand those of SIS and SOE are not fully knownto the LRC, and that the LRC is not regarded asthe servant of al those organisations. TheLRC should have the fullest possible particularsabout escape routes and aboutconditions inoccupied territory. They would then be in afar better position to detect spies and also toprotect the offensive organisations.Charles tells me that the D G. is upset aboutthe memo which I gave him showing our presentand future commitments with regard to theSecond Front. I have in fact told him about allthese things but he has presumably forgot-ten. He is particularly worried about ouroffer of 6 interrogators from the LRC but heevidently does not understand that they will ineffect be a kind of LRC advance guard and takeoff work from the LRCin the same say that theRSLOs took off work from the central office in1940-41.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/193166The D.G. saw myself,Dick, Maciver, TAR and CharlesButler fiestly on the subject of Dykes and'Arcy Irvine. He agreed to Dy kes coming toB.1A provided MacIver found that the RegionalCommissioners concerned did not object. Itwas proposed that Glover should supervise boththe Notts and Birmingham regions. AS regardsD'Arcy Irvine, the D.G. was agreeable to hisbeing taken on. TAR however said that theprospects of getting him were not very bright.The D. G. then considered my note to him settingout our present and future commitments forLOSSAC. He had the impression that without paidconsultatio with himself we had been takingon commitments whic might seriously impairthe efficiency of the office, and it was clearlynogood trying to explain to him that all thesematters had been the subject of discussion whichhe had evidently forgotten. He was particularlyworried about the suggestion about the 6 interro-gators from LRC. Dick and I pointed ou't thatthese officers would be a sort of advance guardfor the LRC and in that sense would be takingworkioif the Lrc. The D. G. was not inclined tocaccept this view and said he would likesee Baxter. We have of course consultedBaxter intimately on the whole problem.February l0thCheney came to see me about the project of send-ing about 2,000 Normegians to this country fromStockholm. T'hese people were to join theNorwegian forces and the Norwegi n MerchantNavy. L spoke to Maxwell as this proposalOatalegueoRetereacerktv4/to3the suggestions we(b7had been making yesterday about stopping as manyallied nation ls from coming to this countey aspossible, until after Overlord had been launchedHe had not heard of the suggestion which Lthink had originally been made by the Norwegiansto the Americans, who had agreed to bring thesepeople here in Liberators. He said that hewould take the matter up at once. I also gotthe D.G. to write to Cadogan.Geoffrey Wethered told me about the case ofan SOE man alled GILBERT, a Frenchmanwho hasbeen running a reception committee for SOEagents in France. He has been denounced as anenemy agent from 3 different sources. It ishowever extremely difficult to arrive as aatisfactory conclusion since either the materiaitnesses are not here or GILBERT cannot ongrounds of security be interrogated on thebasis of their evidence. GILBERT is at presentthe only channel through hich SOE can putagents into France. They are therefore anxiousif possible to send him back.I had a word with the DMI about ISPAL. Maunsellwants to bring Kirk, Hunloke and the GOCPal-estine into the picture. DMI agreed subjectto C's approval.I am told that the enquiry into the affairs ofSOE eventually reached Cabinet level, where anunfavourable vie vas taken. The PM however onhis return from N.Africa sent for Selbourne andgave orders that the dropping of agents was tocontinue.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/193( 6&Harry came to talk to me about the JIC paperon sabotage risks. L have suggested certainamendments since there were statements whichif challenged could not be substantiated.Altogether the report is I think rather anunsatisfactory one.Dy.F. has turned down the prosecution of LALOUNed Reid has netted another ErO, 000 for thetreasury.I had dinner with Lemon, TAR and Anthony: Lemonstrikes me as bring quite bright and intelli-gent.

He wanted to discuss with me Stop-iora's - I.B. draft for the Channel Islands.He began by saying that he thought thatStopford's section seemed to bespreading it-elf. all over the office. i said that Stop-forC.'s section had been primarily conceivedfor the urpose of running seamen agents toforeign ports for the purpose of penetratingany German orgnisation employed in runningseamen agents and getting control of thatataogue REfererea.v4n93 ubsequentiy he hadhad included in his charter the penetritionTHIS-IS THIS-S ACOP A COPY16aORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958Doof fast air lines to the continent.
