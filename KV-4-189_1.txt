I said that it was impossible toexpress any views about the way that theJaos were likely to behave after a declara-tion of war. The F.O. representativewho seemed to have a fair knowledge ofJapanese habits and in fact looked ratherlike one himself did not think the Japcitizens here. would give any trouble. Hedid however consider that it would be-dangers to leave them at large in a placelike Singapore. Hie was anxious that weshould be as conciliitory as possibie sincehe feared reprisals in Shangai where thereare 10,000 British subjects and in Tientsinwhere there are also several thous ind.He was more anxious about the fate of thesepeople than the thousand British subjectswho were residing in Japan proper. I sawthe D.G. later and he agreed to the intern-ment policy suggested.The news from the Libyar front seems reassuring and there is no doubt that the Russiansare making progress west of Rostov.December ndNothing of interest was discussed t theD.G.S neeting.I had a word with Grogan about.the measuresbeing taken to test correspondence forCatalogireRefekence.kv/4/89 me that the actual217testing personnel are being recruited andthat as they come in the percentage of mailtested will correspondingl increase.Collins has not yet obtained sanction forhis additional chemists but this matter isin h nd.D.G. sai myself and Victor about theDorothy case. He has made up his mind thathere is nothing to be gained by allowinthe wireless set to go in in the biscuittin, since Walter VEGENER was alre idyinterned. I tried to explain that theproject had a definite intelligence value.If Walter started to transmit we hoped tolearn firstly whetherthere was any subver-sive rganisation among the internees inthe I.0.M. and secondly Whether Wegenerwould communicate tot the Germans thatcertain of his former collaborators inSiemens Schuckerts were now at large andcould be made use of. The D.G. felt thatif Wegener used the set he would ultimatelyhave to be arrested and that ourconnivancein the whole matter Nould then come out.I do not think that this is ne essary.We should be able to arrange mattersSO that no difficulties of this kindarises.

I hadpreviously told him that 1 thought we shouldbe of more use to his department if we hada better idea of what they were trying todo. He told me that he was interested inday to day events in enemy and enemy-occupiedterritory, for example information aboutfood, economic conditions, appointments,bombing and SO forth. He was also interestedin the reaction of public opinion to theseevents, for example evidence showing whethera particular appointment was popuiar or not,gossip about individuals, evidence of thestate of morale in particular localities.He was also interested in in the receptionof B.B.C. broadcasts and comnents about them.He thought that we could held firstly byputting him on to peaple who arrived herefrom enemy territory or enemy-occupiedcountry, secondly he thought that Ne mightCatalogue Reference:KVI4/18921abe able to tell him about people who hadlived here for some time but who at somestage in their career had been intimatelyassociated with prominent personalities takipart in the New Order in Europe.

Atpresent they had a good deal of euipmentand not a great dea of work.. It wasdecided to raise this matter in higherquarters. A Jap B.F. indicates that ifcommunications are cut in the event of warthe Embassy should rely upon communicatioCatalogue'Reference.kvi4/18ginferenceisthat910the Navy Dept. here nill have a powerfulreceiving set but that they will not betransmitting. The question of the installa-tion of a transmitter was discussed sometime ago between the Ambassador and his F.U.but was turned down for a variety of reasonsArrangements may have been made by Navalcypher for the installation of a transmittinset but this seems doubtful. If there is aset here it has not so far shown any signsof life nor have any messages been trans-mitted which would normally have been sentby diplomatic, naval or military cy her.We know this because all messages have beentaken down and were numbered consecutively.However, in order to be quite sure we arehaving the vans out in order to do a bitof snifting. If the Japs declare warthey are going to notify their Emb ssiesabroad by a code message in a broadcast.The B.B.C. are looking out for this messageand two representatives of .I.S. arewith them to assist. The Jap Embassy herehad instructions to break up the cypnermachines so presumably in future they willbe communicating throug h naval or militaryyphers. It is difficult to see whetherthis is just nervousness, or whether it ispart of a pre-arranged plan to declare waron a given date. The F.O. have now goneback on the decision reached at the meetingat the H.O. to discuss the interneent ofJaps in the event of war. They say thatthey do'nt wish to intern anybody except theseamen, and that this was what was agreed.Catalogue Reference:KV/I4/189221I had a conference with Theo, M., Kennethand Alley about the desirability of M.running certain of their agents. It wasagreed that where so-called agents werein fact little more than informants givingpolitical background etc. it was preferablethat they should be run by the sections.If it was a case of putting in an agent itshould be for consideration whether theagent might not be better handled by M'sorganisation, which had more experiencein matters of this sort. The position wassubsequently discussed with the D.G.,D.D.G.aand myself. D.G. agreed with our findingsand also confirmed his view that the plinby which M. should send round re presentativeof his section to regions in order todiscuss with them what assistance B.2 couldafford was unnecessary. He thought that itwas for the RSLOS to bring their cases toheadquarters. M. said that he would issuea circular to that effect. I explained thatneither M. nor I had ever intended thatB.2's representative should be more thancommercial travellers. We thought howeverthat they would stimulate activity in theregions where the ordinary methods ofinvestigation usually came to a dead end.D.G. has agreed to the B.1.A(1)sscheme forrecruiting agents.I had a talk with the D.G. about the Dorothycase and explained to him wlYat the advantageswere from the intelligence point of view.Firstly we hoped to find out something abouta possible organis tion among the internmentCatalogae Reference:kV/4/189 secondly we thought122that at Wegener might indicate what represen-tatives of Siemens Schuckert were still ininternment and could be relied upon fromthe German point of view. Lie has now agreedto let the scheme go forward.GOERTZ'S arrest has now been confirmedand has been published in the Rrish press.So far we have no details.December 5thJ.C. came to see me about a matter which hethought should be put before the W.Board. ThThe XX Comnittee through their own channelshave been feeding information to S.I.S. forpassing to the French Deuxieme Bureau. D.M.has refused to pass this information anylonger.unless he knows more about it.Personally I feel that this is a matter whichwould be better settled by C. direet withthe D.M.I. I said that I would have a worewith C. and ask him which method he preferredNeville came up to see me about a serioussase of leakage in the Admiralty. It is saidthat one of the First Lord's secretariehas passed informationabout the sinking ofthe "Barham" to a Professor Postan of M.E. W.who passed it on to other people in M.E. W.Eventually it got back to N.I.D. I agreedto go with Neville, to see Farrer this after-noon. Neville wants to have everybodyarrested.The C in . West Indies has telegraphed aboutCatalogue Reference:KVI4/189a man called Maximo Munoz LOPEZ, who hasvolunteered information to the effect taata Spaniard working for the Gestapo inGabraitar is giving away vital informationabout our warships. We had a meetingat the Admiralty at which AD NI, Victor,Machell,Foster and myself were present.The Admiralty are thinking of sending outColonel Corvo of the Marines to Gib. intorder to look into the leakage question.Colonel Corvo has no experience in investi-gations and all he can do is to ginger up thenaval authorities. The Admiralty haverequested us to send out a special investi-gator. I feel that if anybody should goHart would be the best man as he has hadprevious experience in Admiralty enquiriesand has carried them out most efficiently.I urged very strongly that LOPEZ who is nowin Bermuda should be sent back here. Forsterthought that he should be dealt with inWashington or New York. said that I thouhit preferable that he should come heresince we should understand much morewhat he was talking about.I went with Cussen to M.E.W. this afternoonwhen we saw both Farrer and Nickers. A.D.N.I.joined us there. He stated his case toVickers and it was finally decided thatCussen should interrogate all those at M.E.W.concerned with the leakage. From whatVickers said I do not think we should havemuch of a case against Postan although hehas clearly talked very irdiscreetly.His excuse will be that the does of theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18g ggportant bearing on224work that he was doing and that theAdmiralty representative had mentioned thematter to him in this connection.There has been an interesting development inthe Stella case. She has sent a wire to aman called BOULANGER in Marseilles who shepreviously told us was her lover and had noconnection vith Intelligence work. She asksBoulanger whether he nas given news ofSOLONGE to Rene. Stella has already toldus that she had false papers in the nameof SOLONGE. LONSDALE'S sister who is agreat friend of Stella's has been spendingtwo nights with her tthefiat. The mikerevealed that Stella was nervous about nerconversation being overheard. It looks moreand more as ifshe were a German agent. neis undoubted Ly a clever woman. She wasshown a photograph of von EINEM and almosttoo hurriedly handed it back saying thatshe had never seen him before.I spoke to Newsam about the F.O. attitudetowards the internment of Japs. He saidthat it had been agreed that the 70 seamenwere to go in and up to 100 others. I toldAntony to collect a copy of the H.O. docu-ment and to see the F.O. again.According to a B.J., the Germans are evident-ly anxious to bring the Japs into thewar Ribbentrop in talking to the Jap Ambass-ador in Berlin is putting up a terrific bluffabout German suecesses and future plans.On the 29th November he said that GermanyCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/189175had more or less achieved her first objectivin Russia though she would of course continuthe campaign in the Caucasus. The attackon the remainder of the Russian front wouldbe resumed in May , the objective being theUrals. Ribbentrop was very noncommittalabout the invasion of Britain and saidthat first of all Germany would deal withthe Near East, Gib. and Africa. When thishad been achieved and we had been drivenfrom the Mediterranean he thought probablethat an invasion would no lo ger beunnecessary since ve should capitulate.He hoped that the ar might be over by theend of 1942 but envisaged the possibilityof its continuing until 1943. The Japreported this to Toky o without much commentbut seems to be impressed. He generallyreports what he thinks Tokyo would like tohear. The same may be said for Rome.The only objective reports that lokyo getsare from London.December 6thI went over to a meeting at the Admiraltywith ol.Caufeild, and Janson.We compossa telegram to CincinWest Indies aboutMunoz LOPEZ. I stressed the importance ofgetting LOPEZ back to this country sincewe here had the requisite knowledge for hisinterrogation. Neither in Bermuda, New Yorknor Washington would people really know Thathe was talking about. It was suggested inthe telegram that it should be explained toLOPEZ that his project for the release ofCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189226his ompatriots in N. Africa could only beworked out in conjunction with the appropri-ate authorities in London and that his pre-sence here was therefore a matter of considerable importance. We also asked C. in C.to give us some information about LOPEZ'Santecedents.

He evidently knows about thedaily reports on ship ing movements fromGib. which appear on ISOS.Lennox tells mne that. the American haveagreed that if the Japs attack Thailandthey will give us their full support.Roosevelt does not think however that hecould bring the Americ ns in if the Japsdo no more than carry out attacks on theBurma Road which is in fact something thatthey have done before without serious con-sequences. Anxiety is felt here as towhat the Americans would do if the Japssucceeded in getting Thailand, throughpressure, to acquiesce in occupation.Thismatter is being taken up with Winint,sincefrom the point of view of our security itmatters little thetner the Jyips get intoThailand through persuasion or aggression.Roosevelt has suggested to the Japs thatthey should maintain only a token force ingueReference:KV4/8gle should withdrawprogressively from China. If they wouldagree to these to things in principle,negotiations could be undertaken withourselves, the Americans and the Dutch onall the other points at issue. Kurusu hassaid that at this stage such a suggestioncan only be made direct by Roosevelt tothe Emperor. The Govt. of Japan have gone soso far that they could not possibly acceptthese conditions as a basis for negotia-tions without losing face. If they areover-ridden by the Emperor, they will justresign, and a more moderate cabinet will beappointed in their place. It is difficultto know how far the Japs are just trailingtheir coat.I have just heard that a convoy has beenseen accompanied by Jap warships, and itis thought that an invasion of Thailandmay be imminent.The meeting came off with Gunner JACKSONlast Thursday He committed himself verybadly. He wants to go to Geramny to broad-cast as he thinks that that is the onlyway of getting rid of "this rotten GoverIment". He talks a grea deal of discontentin the army but most of what he says is clear-ly imagination. He does not want anymoney, only his expenses. He is quiteready ultimately to give information aboutour gun-sites and if necessary to come overhere and assist the Germans in bombing them.The case is to be put to the Judge Advocatfor his view as to whether Gunner JACKSONCatalogue Cataloguereferenee.KVf4/i8972%December 7thI went over with Cussen to see Neville.We showed him the statements which Lussenhad taken from those in M.E.W. who we econnected with the leakage of informationregarding the sinking of one of H.M. ships.I told Neville that in Cussen's view thecase would not look well in court if a chargewere brought under D.R.3.

It was feltthat the Englishman could only be Sempilland his apartment and office were conse-wuently raided. Only a few Air Ministryand Admiralty reports of no particularinterest were discovered. He has of coursecommitted a technical breach of the regula-tions but we are fairly confident that hehad not retained the documents for anyulterior purpose. There was a scarelater on that the Ambassador's house inGrosvenor Square contained a transmitter.Post Office wireless vans were quiteconfident. It transpiredeventually thatthe transmissions were from a house occupiedby the Poles in an adjoining street. F.O.were quite prepared to let us go in if wefound anything to search all the otherEmbassy remises. They were fortified inthis idea by the news that our Chanceryin Tokyo had been searched for wirelessequipment.

Had the Japs not come inthere were very real signs that the Germanswere in serious difficulties both in Russiaand in Libya.

He discounted the suggestionthat it might have been EDVARDES on thegrounds that he knew EDWARDES voice quitewell.Catalogue ReferEnCe:KVI4/189December 15tI saw Jock whyte about the case of funnerJACKSON. He told me that t JACKSON hadwritten asking for another interview. Thismatter was discussed with the Judge Advocatewho was anxious tat the interview shouldtake place and that an ther agent should beintroduced who could appear in a CourtMartial and give his name. It wasthought desirable that this agent shouldget some admission from Gunner JACKSONthat he was the author of the originalletter addressed to the Spanish E.bassy.That letter could then be used as evidence.If this meeting could not be brought aboutwe could still consider using Roberts andthe microphone convert tion which waswitnessed by 3 representatives of thepolice. e could offer to produce Robertson condition that his n me was not divulged.If the defence pressed for these particu-lars we could then refuse to roduce himnd rely upon the other evidence. It wasleft to Hoch Whyte to fix up the furtherintervie.I lunched with Trevor-Roper, who is veryworried about the capabilities of Madementin connection vith the pioneering workwhich it has been decided to do in Canadaon Jap ISOS.

I am fairlyconfident that T-R is correct in his views.We shall have to see what we can do.Senter came to see me about the case ofCommandant SERVAES who S. O.E. wint tosend to Gib. I told him that Ne were veryworried about allied Governments runningtheir own S.S. in Gib. and that I thou htthat t ese cases should be discussed on thehighest level. C.S.S. 1ad been stronglyopp posed to anything of the kind here ande do not vish these allied Govte. to go andopen up in Gib. where security was alreadyab a pretty low ebb. It ould be impossiblif they all started running agents in andout of the fortress. I have put lis matterforward to the D.G.Sir Francis Lindley has been seen in connec-tion with the SEMPILL case. He states thatat the time of the firsttelephone conversaticSempill was in fact attending a meetingof the Japan Society, that he did not Leavethe room ind that afterwards he accompanisir Francis for a period of about 20 minutes.This statement in fact corresponds ith thereport of the watchers who gave quite anaccurate description of Sir Francis. Itlooks therefore asif the first and secondconversations were not related. The secondone in which some uned cated Englishmanspeaking to KAMIMURA, delivers a message onbehalf of "Bill S." is still unexplained.Personally I think it undoubtedly refersCatalogue t.o Reference:kVI4/189 that he has237comunicated either directly or indirectlywith any member of the Jap Emb say sincethe outbreak of war. The message deliveredto KAMIMURA was to the eff ct that Bill S.had been going through a difficult timebut that every thing was being taken care of.KAMIMURA was to remember that Bill S. jadnot communic ted with him since the out-break of war. The implication was thatin fact he had so communicateDecember l6thD.G.meeting. The position of Spain wasdiscussed. There are about 1,000 Spaniardsin this country. We should wish to intern20 or 30 members of the Falange and perh psanother 30 suspects. In addition therewould be a cert in number of seamen, notvery many. There is to be a meeting withthe H.O. on Thursday to work out finaldetails.I raised the question of the responsibilityfor security in Gib. If acts of sabotagewere committed how far was it our respon;sibility and hon far that of the Governor.It was obviously up to us to give Med dlamas much information as possible but werewe satisfied that the advice he ws givingto the governor was sound and that allproper precautions were being taken. Nobodyseemed to be very clear on this point hichhangs to a large degree on the efficiency ofMedlam as a security officer I said that hehad not had any great experience and thatCatalogue his EReference:KV4/189 them, did not fill938us ith very great confidence. This ledme to raise the question of contact withour security links abroad and the difficult-ies of transport. If rapid transport werereadily available we could maintain muchcloser touch with Egypt,Gub. Bermuda andother places where matters which were vitalare going on. It might have been veryuseful to us to send someone out to Bermudato interview MUNOZ LOPEZ. There was nobodythere who really understood what he wastalkin about and his information vit llyconcerned the security of Gib. rortunatelyCowgill was in the U.S. and we had arrangedfor LOPEZ to go on to Washington. In thecase f Gib. we had for more than to eeksbeen trying to send out a representative butthere appe red to be no means of doing so.If there vere a ounderland lyingboat thehourney could be ccomplished in 6 hoursand we should have our representariive backhere within 5 dayse with a full report..As things are we/completely in the dark.Many of our links had no ex erience inB.Branch work. It was therefore vitailyimportant that ve should keep in closetouch ith there and give them every possibleassistance with information and advice.D.G. agreed that the lack of transport prese]-ted a serious problem. He was quiteprepired to raise it on a high Level andin particular the case of getting an officercut to Gib. E said that in the meantimewe had been forced to send a long telegramto Medlam ind that 1 did hot think itwould be advisable in present circumstancesCatalogueReference.KV14/189 put before ve had a reply939and before the general situation, whichlooked rather menacing, had cleared. Wedid not wish to have one of our best officerstranded on the lock for the rest of thewar. This did not however alter the generalproblem which I thought ought to be raisedboth by ourseive and S.I.S. It seemed tome incomprehensible that in the rd year ofthe war and after the construction of somany aircraft that ve could not move aboutmore freely.Senter came to see me about the case ofFrederick STRAUSS, a so-called rilwayexjert in S.0.E. tneyhad at last deeidedto get rid of him, aving discovered thathe was an accomplished Liar and a pilfererof the petty cash. Characterically we havebeen asked to look after him.I attended a meeting called by owinton at vh|D.u. and C.S.S. were present. We diseussedthe question of shipping security in Spainand on the East Coast Of Africa. Swinton'sidea is to set up something on the linessimilar to the Security o-ordination inthe U.S.A. and S.America, acting throughlocal British shipping agents. He thinksthis is necessary owing to the inefficiencyof consuls and vice-consuls. He sueceststhet one (?)LENSTER, shipping assistant tothe Military attache in Madrid, should beemployed on this work, whichyin the firstinstance will only be exploratory. If thereare suitable shipping representatives at HuelHuelva, elilla,Vigo etc. he thinks that theymight be given a certain amount of instruc-Catatlogle'Referehcevkvpa/1sgpas on to the masters240ofships. C. agreed to these exploratorymeasures subject to approval by the Admiraltyand Ministry of War Transport. It wasdecided therefore to call a meeting of thesebodies and S.I.S. and ourselves. C. spokevery strongly about over-loading of SecurityCo-ordination in the Americas. He saidthat the organisation was now getting sobig that its main function, namely theobtaining of intelligence and C.E work,was being neglected. Swinton saw the pointbut did not feel that Stephenson's extraneousactivities could be controlled by anyoneelse. C. said that the matter had gonevery far and that quite recently he had beenasked by the British Admiralty delegation tofoot a bill for 10,000 for Admiraltysecurity work. He did not think that theS.S. should be called upon to pay forservices of this kind.December L/thD.L.G. held a meeting on the subject ofSEMPILL when all aspects of the case werediscussed with all concerned. It was agreedthat in the light of the evidence availableit was almost impossible for SEMPILL tohave been a party to the first telephoneconversation. There were 3 witnesses nd thewatchers to corroborate the fact that necould n t have had access to the tele honeat the material time. On the other handit seemed at least prob obable le that EDWARDESmight have been the man who rang up theEmbassy. It will be remembered that tol.Wilson had diseredited EDWARDES on the groundCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189that he knew his voice. We were able to syyhowever from our records that on 2 or 5occasions we had established that EDWARDESwas the speaker when col.Wilson's dept.had been unable to identify him. We also hada re ort from our informant in the mbassythat it was EDWARDES and not SEMPILLL whohad been responsible for a conversation aboutthe retention of the services of irs.Dixonwho had been employ eo by the bassador.It seemed therefore that little reliancecould be placed on ol.Wilson's view.EDWARDS was the only other rerson known tous who might fit the bill. As a servant ofthe Jap Embassy he would naturally havehad books and papers relating to Embassybusiness and he might well have soughtKAMIMURA'S instructions about their retentionor destruction. It was decided thereforethat Major Cussen and Mr. Young should inter-view EDWARDES with a view to obtaining somesort of confirmation from him.TRICYCLE'S questionnaire is now in ourpossession. It shows quite clearly thatin August last the Germans were veryanxious to get as full particulars aspossible about rearl Harbour.I had a talk with V.V. about T-R's views xkxre the sending of Gill t Canada to do thepioneer work on Jap ISOS. I put all mycards on the table and V.V. as I expected res-ponded warmly. He said ne found hisposition in this matter an extremely diffi-cult one as he like myself, was unable toCatalogueaReferenceikvt4nson Catalbgue On the otherhand he was very much persuaded by T-R'sarguments. He agreed to see C.S.S. with meon Friday and to put the full facts beforehim. I said that ii Morton Evans wereseen and asked whether he thought Madementwas qualified to carry out the pioneer orkhe would give an emphatic no, and thoughtthat as Madement was working under MortonEvans his views should be taken into accountI heard later thatEDWARDES had been seenand denied that he was the author of theconversation with KAMIMURA. We are thereforno further either on the first conversatioror the second.December l8thI had a talk with T.A.R. and Miles about theStella case. Mills is emphatically of theopinion that Stella is a German agent butit is going to be very difficult to tripher up. She is now pressing to be allowedto return to France. Milis and T.A.R. avehad a long talk with Dansey who has put allhis cards on the table. He said he hadnever received Milmo's report giving theinformation about GESSLER. He produced hisown traffic which if it had been seen by ussmme months ago might well have preventedS.I.S. being led up the garden so long.It was quite clear to T.A.R. from its formthat GESSLER was under control. Dansey isvery anxious that his officers shouldcollaborate closely with ours, but feelsthat this is not possible under existingCatalogue Reference Reference.kv/4/18s that we should raisthe matter through the D.G. and C.S.S.Iam quite certain that iiwe do this it shouldbe done with the concurrence of V.V. and ththe should be kept informed of the contactswhich we make. These contacts will bemainly for the purpose of discussion andcomparison of notes. There is no doubtthat ee should be of great help to Dansey'speople and they might be of helt to us.Me must ho vever keep Section V. informed.I also had a discussion with T.A.R. andMarriott about Christian Hans von KOTZE.This man who formerly lived in .Africahas been working for the German S.S. inBrazil. He has given is a lot of valuableinformation about German .S.activities inBrazil and b.Africa, partly I think becausehe dislikes t le Nazi regime and partlybecause he wishes to get back to his wifeand family in S.Africa. The Germans nowwish him to go back to Africa. We thinkit would be a good thing if we could sendsomeone to establish a better liaison withthe AFRICANS AND TO GIVE THEM OUR VIEWS ONhow Von KOTZE should be handled. Thisraises once more the question of rapidtransport, concerning which I have submitteda memo to the D.G. It is almost impossiblenow to carry on our work without rapidtransport facilities.At the R.S.S. meeting we discussed the ques-tion of Jap ISOS. I read a copy of Swinton'letter to Cranbourne in which he suggeststhat the Canadian P.M. should be askedto give the scheme his blessing. I alsoCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/189quumentioned the case of the alleged wireless Sset in the Jap Embassy. It seemed to methat the vans had not functioned veryefficiently. Maltby said that the equip-ment was being improved and that thefailure to discover that the offending setwas a Polish one was largely due to thePost Office officials not having carriedout their instructions.ISOS indicates a great deal of activitypointing to a possible invasion of theIberian Peninsua, and the occupat for ofFrench territory in N.Africa. In the-meantime Romel is being hard ressed indit is hoped that we may be abl to cuttoff his retreat. Some arge Italian transporaccompanied by several battleships navebeen sighted south of Greece and west ofof Crete. Our fleet is moving up andan engagement is expected. It is thoughtthat these transports may be makingforDerna and that they are bringing reinforce-ments to Rommel. the situation in the FarEast is not good. We are having to giveground in Malaya. Sarawak has been occupiedafter the destruction D of the oil refineryplant.December 19thV.V. and I saw Stewart about the Jap ISOS.V.V. said that he and Fergusen were reason-ably convinced that T-R's view was theright one and he thought that if possibleStenart should see Maltby ind suggest to himCatalogue Reference:KVI4/189that possibly someone more suitable mightgo out to do the pioneering work. In thisconnection he would mention Gill. I saidI thought it was imperative that he shouldsee Morton Evans and if necessary T-R whowere really qualified to speak on thismatter. Morton Evans had a rather speciallocus standi since Madement was one of hissubordinates. He would be quite readyto say what he thought if he were asked.Stevart promised to take the matter in handbut I do not know whether anything willcome of it.I had a talk with V.V. about our relationswith Dansey. He is I think quite agreeableto direct relations provided we keep himinformed of wnt is going on.A wire has come in from Felix about MUNOZLOPEZ. LOPEZ undoubtedly hae some of theISOS codes. He also knows about a codeused, in broadcasts from Melilla. He saysthat the leakage in Gib. is through somerepresentative of our Nav I Office to along-resident Spaniard who owns a shopabd thence to a German agent outside theFortress area. le does not ish us to takeany action until we have rescued his com-rades from N.W.Africa. His business withPrieto concerns some republican plot inSpain. Felix says there is a completeItalian message which may well have a bearingon the leakage problem at Gib.Stewart told me today that the lost bagat Ankara hasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189found in a umber2u6room. the Embassy are so naive as tothink that it has not been compromised.Meanwhile a man called SHERNGTOM hasevidently handed out certai informationregarding in increase of security staffat the Embassy, since there isa reflectionof this on ISOS. I gather ho ever thatSheringtov is being used as a somewhatcurious XX. He has Hungarian connections.An enguiry has been sent to Ankara witha view to finding out whether the passingon of the information about the securitystaff was authorised.December 20thWe have had an important te legram fromFelix. It makes it more than ever clearthat MUNOZ LOPEZ was telling the truth.He evident knows a good deal about bothItalian and German cyphers. It is cleartoo that some sort of broadcasting is:going on from Melilla which contains code.CARRICK of the Worthy Down case wassentenced two or thre days ago to 10 yearsimprisonment. This seems pretty stiff.The general impression is that the man ismore an exhibitionist than anything else.December 2lstI went over to N.I.D. after sending atelegram to ledlam giving him LOPEZ'Saddition al information to the effect thatthe eakage was from a Naval Staff OficerCatalogue Reference!kvi4nggib with whom he247communicated at the shop of a long-residentSpaniard. The latter transmitted it byhand or verbally to someone outside thefortress area. There does not appear tobe any wireless transmission from the Rock.There has been a further case of leakagewithin a period of 48 hours to the Italiansand we are more than ever confident thatsomebody in F.O.C.N.A.'s office must behanding out the information.D.N.I. is now very worried about the wholebusiness and wants us to send out a specialinvestigator. He is bringing the matter tothe notice of the Board of Admiralty, suggesting that they should send a strong telegramto Admiral Collins telling him to overhaulthe security of his own office.December 22ndVictor,Arnold Foster and I had a talk thismorning about Swinton's proposals forsecurity measures in Spain.

The present system seemsto have worked well since no less than 53bombs have been removed from ships andthere has been no real cise of damageexcept from outside Spain, namely Meliilawhere a bomb was placed on the Grelhardquite recently. It was agreed fin llythat the Ambassador should be asked toconsult the Nav 1 Attache about the relia-bility of the various consuls and ascer-tain whether they had the necess ry supportfrom the local British community. It wasalso agreed that the chains of responsibilitshould remain as at present.I spoke to Swinton after the meeting aboutthe transport and the eans of being ableto get officers to places where we hadlinks abroad. I said that as things vereat resent ve really could not carry outour work.

On tne analogy of the HIRSCH-GILLINSKYcase it was agreed that in matters such asthis the directions to our joint links inthe colonies should be given by us ratherthan by S.I.S.

IB by at least to of icers.I have suggested Baxter suggested and Vesey to theD.G. He say the point but was non-comnittal.I spent the rest of the day going throughthe Gib.leakage case with Dick. Our con-clusion is that in 5 cases leakage seemsto be due either to a cipher break OT toa hand out by an agent but that in one casethe evidence definitely points to a hand-out. I went over to see Neville in theevening and arranged ith him for Dick toh ve credentials from the Secretary of theBoard empowerin him to investigate in theNaval Office at Gib. and ordering that heshall have the S.0.I. placed at his dis-posal for this purrse He is to stand byfrom 12 noon on Monday. There is noquestion of sending anyone else with him aswe can only get one place on the flying-boat.I had a long talk with john Booth last week.He told me that the American tanks werepoor value and that our own cruiser wassecond to none and that all the alk aboutinferior arm ment was bunkum, The Germantanks re good but ours are certaibet er. He has been getting out a book onrecognition of echanised vehicles from theair. There has been a certain amount oftrouble in Libya in this connection and onone or two occasions ve have bombed our ownvehicles. I gather that the Germans areslightly sorse at recognition than e are.Two squadrons have now beenspeciallytrained and are likely to be sent to theCatalogue Reference:KVI4/189263Middle East. There is rather a seriousdis ute going on about the accuracy of ournight-bombing. Photographs sho that veare often very wide of the mark, apart fromoecasions when we bomb one town instead ofanother. The German flat is extremelyfierce over many of the targets which ourpeople have to bomb and may to some extentlead to indiscriminate dropping. Johnthinks that on the assumption that allindustry in Germany is likely to be farmore interlocked than our own, it nould bebetter to bomb to ns shere there is notso much flac. This would be likely to causejust as much dislocation and ould forcethe enemy to move his flac from the morevital is a great targets. deal Personally in this argument I think and there th atthe concentration on vital targets whichis attractive in theory may not be sucha sound one as it seems. I am going totry and put this over tactfully.Rommel has sueceeded in getting away southof Benghazi but I understand Ne have acolumn waiting for him in Tripoli. Thereis no doubt he is extremely short of petrolWe destroyed 137 aircraft during last weekin Libya and Tripoli. The Russian ampaignseems to be going well and the reports arethat the Germans withdrew from Kalinin insome disorder; although there is no signof a definite crack-up the departure ofBrauchitsch and other generals must have hada great effeet on morale and there seemslittle doubt that a major upheava hasCatalogue taken Reference:KV/4/189 place in party circles.Wehave sent 5 capital ships to the Far Eastwhich may well leave us somewhat shorthandedhaving in the a Mediterranean. hard time in the The Phil Americans ipines. are TheJars have landed 120,000 men at Luzon andthere are onl 25,000 amerieans to deal withthem.

Up to now we have merely beentrying to get her to talk. She certainlyhas, and I am told that some of her conver-sation is of the filthiest kind.December 23thThe H.O. have called a conference fortomorrow to decide on what is to be donein the event of war with Portugal. I donot yet know what has given rise to thismatter. It may be merely that the situatiis somewhat tense in view of our seizureof the island of Timor in order to pro-tect it against Jap aggression. TheD.G. tells me that we had a tacit agree-ment with the Portuguese about this,however, and th at in order to keep them-selves right with the Germans they hadto make some kind of a show of protest.ISK messages hich are the first vehave received show a reference to BODEGASas being a German agent in Gib. The n?name appears in two messages and isinteresting confirmation of the statemnent:made by MUNOZ LOPEZ.After strone representations made by theU.S.A. to the Brazilian Govt. at ourrequest, the Brazilians h Ive in fact with-drawn Lahti's franchise by informing themcategorically that the service S.America-Cape Verde- .Spain-Italy must discontinueforthwith. This represents the enemy'sCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189256only line of postal communic tion withthe americas which does not pass throughBritish censorship and the cutting of thisline is therefore of considerable impor-tance.December 29thPhilby has produced details of a number ofagents in Gib which have been sent toMedlamIt seems that the RockHotel at Gib., the Hotel Reina Cristinaat Algeciras and an hotel in Tangier, areall in the hands of the Germans. TheReina Cristina is run by a German calledLEIB who is undoubtedly the central figurein the local German espionage network.The hotel seems to have belonged at onetime to Lord Farringeon and is now theproperty of his grandson Lt.Schreiber, ourAir Attache at Lisbon. His name was foundon MAYORGAS of KLEINWARTS who has beenarrested by the F.B.I. recently. Thereis no reason to think that there is anythingwrong with Schreiber. The Villa Leonewhich has featured, rather prominently, inthe SUNDAE case, is used by LEIB for housinghis German friends.Dick and I and Curry gave the Czechs Lunch.Sloane took the view, quite spontaneously,that the early arrivals here by boat andparachute were an indication that theGermans had no deep-seated organisation inthis country. This may or may not be SO.In any case we shall have to go on lookingfor one. I discussed the possibilities ofCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189251getting some further information about theGerman Intelligence organisation from theRussians. Both Sloane and Bartik wereof the opinion that it was hopeless to tryand attempt anything of the kind here sinceeverybody was terrified of divulging anyinformation without express sanction ofMoscow. The Czechs have their representa-tive in Moscow who has been trying throughvarious channels to obtain informationabout the Germans. The furthest his con-tact has got has been an introduc tionto someone who was supposed to no[ Whenthis person was approached he said thathe knew nothing. The stock answer of theRussians to any questions about the GermanIntelligence, armaments, etc. is "Well, yousee, it all depends on -" this, that or theother. It seems impossible to get anyfurther than these vagaries. The Czechsknow that the Russi ins are well informedsince there was formerly in existencein Czechoslovakia a joint German-Russianorganisation which employed an agent whowas working more for the Hussians thanfor the Germans and succeeded inphotographing several thousand documentsin the Brunnfactory.I had a discussion afterwards with U.35about Vera. He is quite ready to have herbut would welcome the assistance of one ofT.A.R.S F.S.P.S. He does not wish to seeVera until she arrives at his house.Vice-Admiral Leatham who has just beenCatalegue CatalegueRefereace.kV/rr8s to see the D.G. He956seemed to think that there was too muchboasting about the impregnability of Maltaand that quite possibly the Germans mightmake some attempt to take it. He thoughtin any case that it was goingto be a fairlyhot spot. He struck me as a kind of personwho was going to leave nothing to chance.One told him about the Gib. Leakage case andI asked him especially about the repititionof signals. He said that this was alwaysa difficult question in the Navy, as thingswere apt to go wrong unless all those whomight possibly be interested were keptinformed. He realised however that therewere great dangers.Travis came in to discuss the ZPT telegramsand to give us the original text. He wasinclined to agree with Wilson of the Admir-alty that it was unlikely that cipher "C"had been compromised. Had this been SOhe thinks there would have been somereflection elsewhere. I took the opportunityof asking him about our own cyphers. Hesaid that he had never had very much confi-dence in Williams at the W.O. who is supposedto be lookin after our interests. I men-tioned this to Charles who is arranging forCumming to get into direct touch with TravisTravis seemed to think that there was toomuch delay at R.S.S. in submitting theirmaterial to G.C.&.C.S. He was taking stepsto get this speeded up.Victor and Miss Sherer came to see me aboutthe case of UMLAUF @ MrS. Gerhard WESTCOTT.This woman is highly suspect and has offeredCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1895aher services to us in Lisbon. She did atone time wish to come here or alternativelyto go to S. .Africa or some other Britishcoloney. We were prepared to let her inhere and watch her but she seems to havereceived some kind d warning from her has-band that she might be arrested. He hasan additional reason in that he is livingwith another woman. I have suggested thatUMLAUF should be asked to state insome detail what her plans would be if wedecided to accept her services.It is now quite clear that SHERRINGTON hadno authority to communicate information tothe Hungarian journalist Hugo HARASZTI,and clearly her/ is in German pay. It hastherefore been decided to send him toPalestine where he will be arrested andinterrogated.December 30thGunner JACKSON was arrested last night.It seems that the necessary evidence hasbeen obtained."Duck" has produced a re-ciphering tickertape and a number of cypher mess ages withthe re-ciphering figures written in under-neath. These are of the greatest value toGC & CS3I attended a meeting of the Swinton Execu-tive to discuss the establishment of somekind of American security organisation inCatalogue this country. Reference:KVT4/189 Reference: the is that the060Americans should set up a committee ofrepresentatives of their 3 services and ofthe F.B.I. to which we could pass anyinformation regarding American Securitymatters in this country and they could alsoask for our assistance in any cases whichcame to their notice. It was felt thit th t anorganisation of this sort might to someextent relieve Stevenson who is alreadyoverloaded with vetting and security mattersof one kind or another, to the detrimentof his counter-espionage work. Swintonis going to speak to the Ambassador.Balloon has received a letter with Duffcleverly concealed under the flap.

We were out with the vans becauseCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189Vwe were rying to detect illicit transissionby the Japs. These signals were only pickedup by chance. Subsequent enquiries showedthat at least some of them had been pickedupby the RSS Y units but had presumably beendiscredited because the discriminators wereonly interested in ISOS and kindred groups.This raises the whole question of the funC-tions of R.S.S. which was originally setin order to detect illicit transmissionsfrom this country.Victor has had a talk with Swinton about thenew substance called Lauryl Thio-Cyanite,which if worn in a belt, kills or drivesaway lice. This new discovery might havea very important bearing on the course of thewar owing to the fact that lice are thebearers of typhus and that this diseaseis prevalent in Russia. The medical author-ities were just about to publish theinformation about this new discovery insome medical journal. this has now beenprevented.January lst 1942.the First Officer of a Spanisn ship calledthe Aldecoa has been known to us for sometime as a German agent (SOS). This shiprecently arrived at Pointe Noire in Equi-torial Africa and as it went into a prohibiteport the captain was arrested'bybthe FreeFrench.

We have told the FreeFrench, and the Belgians since the shiphas now proceded to Matadi, that we havestrong grounds for suspecting other ship'sO ficers and that they would be well advisedto submit them to a thorough interrogation.I had a talk with Hllan,G.P.0., about theadvisability of the Post Office sendingexperts inand micro-photography to the U.S. I said that theymight possibly find that an exchange of viewswould be to their advantage and that theymight also be able to give the Americanssome useful hints. I thougt that from nowon we had to regard ourselves amost as oneunit with the Americans on all matters ofthis kind. Allan is going to take thematter up in the proper quarter. He spoketo me afterwards about our check on PosteRestante. While the numbers in some areasare small there as as many as 100 letters a dday in places like Glasgow and Liverpool.llan was going to carry out the test inLiverpool personally and will let me knowthe results.Arnold Came to see me about a new M.AAP.security...scheme.

He hopesto get away in the early hours of tomorrowmorning.Hooper senior is in domestic trouble andCatalogoeretereacenkV4lasnad freedd in Glasgow2buhas shocked the susceptibilities of theScotch. He has got to be removed but maybe given another chance in Bristol.January 3rdEden's visit to Moscow appears to havestarted well but he struck a slightly dis-cordant note when Stalin asked that a Pactshould be signed giving Russia the BalticStates after the war. Eden said he couldnot commit the Govt. to such a major stepwithout consultation. Stalin seemed tothink that as a plenipotentiary he oughtto have been abe to give a decision thereand then. Stalin had previously been askedby Eden whether he was proposing to attackthe Japanese in the East. He had repliedthat for the time being he proposed toconcentrate on the Germans. He thought thatultimately the Japs would attack Russiaand he preferred that Japan should be theaggressor since he felt that the Russianswere better if they were called upon todefend their own country. He anticipatedthat the Japs might launch an attack inabout May. Speaking generally he did notthink that they would last more than 6 or 8months. Meanwhile he intended to continuethe counter-offensive against the Germansthroughout the winter. He seemed pleasedwith the present progress that had been madeand was confident that his own troops woulde better able to stand winter conditionsthan the Germans who were extremely poorlyclad. As subsequently stated in his broad-Catalogue Reference:KVI4/189SScast Eden saw a number of German prisonerswho did not appear to have any winter cloth-ing, capable of standing up to the temper-ature, which was then 58 degrees below zero.The Russians on the other hand were extreme-ly well clad in sheepskin coats and adequateboots. Eden visited part of the front inthe vicinity of Klim where a huge dumpof damaged motor vehicles, tanks etc. wasto be seen. It was noticed however thatthere were a good many more Russian behiclesthan German. Stalin seemed impressed byour Valentine tanks which he said had beenextremely satisfactory under Russian condi-tions. Many of the Germin tanks he saidwere far more suited to desert conditionsthan to snow. The German oil was poor andhad to be removed from captured takks beforethey could be used. German petrol was alsoof poor quality.large banquet was given to our delegationat which Stalin made a speech, eyeing Molo-tov from time to time aa if he were lookingfor some sign of approval. Molotov remaineddead sober and somewhat sinister in appea-rance. The others, including Timoshenkoand Stalin, sonsumed a considerable amountof champagne and other liquor. Stalin walkedround the tables himself drinking toasts andseeing that his guests were well provided.There was a general feeling of tremendousluxury among the leaders but Ydrabness amongsttheir subordinates. There seems to begeneral satisfaction with our aircraft, butowing to the rigorous winter conditions everyCatalogue -where Reference:kV74/189 flying has curtailed. Our dele-96agation seemed to have been considerablyimpressed by their journey from Murmansk toMoscow which took only 40 hours instead ofthe customary 7 days.an amusing incident was recounted about aScots Guardsman who had escaped from Germanyto Russia but had been interned in a coneen-tration camp. It seems that when he toldhis captors that he was from the Scots Guardsthey thought he said Scotland Yard. He hasconsequently remained in internment eversince.January 5thI had a long visit from Frost who was some-what disturbed that the reorganisation ofachell'smsection had gone on vithout hisbeing consulted. I said that organisation-ally he had a perfectly legitimate complaintwhich he was within his rights in recordingon the file. I thought however the situationarose to some extent through his being some-what remote from these matters. We thenhad a discussion about R.S.S. and ourresponsibilities It boils down to this,namely that the D.G. will have to decidehimself once and for all whether on technicalmatters he is going to accept unreservedlythe opinions of G-P and Maltby or whetherhe has any right to call upon them to givean account of their stewardship. As thingsare at present they say, like Baldwin,"Trust me" and "My lips are sealed". Ihad a word with the D.G. on this questionCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1896and he suggested that we should put downour views on paper and that he would thenhave a talk with G-P. I said I ratherdoubted whether this would get us muchfurther, since we should only be submergedin an avalanche of megacyeles and othertechnicalities. Frost seems to think thathe is destined to defend us from jargonof this kind. Here again I am ratherin the dark, since I am unable to estimatFrost's capabilities as a technicalexpert. It seems to me that we have eithergot to accept G-P or appoint someone herewith high technical qualifications.Dick seems to have got away on Sat. night orSunday but we have not heard of his arrival.Two other cases have turned up on ISK whichmay indicate a hand-out or cypher break in GiGib. Enquiries are being made at theAdmiralty.I saw Grogan about the Censorship ofmails from the Iberian Peninsula, which hesays is gradually rising and it ishopedthat it will reach 100% in the course ofthe next week or so. I impressed on Groganthat we should take similar steps to analysethe mail in Bermuda with a view to getting100% tests on certain routes. Idoubthowever whether it will be possible toorganise this until Herbert's return.Stephens has submitted a a long reportabout the HIRSCH-GILINSKY case. Thegeneral impression is that both of themCatalogue are ergoks eReferencek/4/1gg of the first water, ready to do268anything which will fill their pockets andsave their Skins. There is at least acertain amount of doubt as to whether theyundertook to work in the German S.S. merelyin order to get out of German clutcheswith as much of their property as they couldsave. Details about the Aubain-Poirierscandal are interesting. Baroness vonEINEM, acting as an agent of Goering madeuse of HIRSCH to transmit about 4, 600,00(francs to the Temps and Figaro, estensiblyin order that these papers might publisharticles favourable to Germayy. In actualfact 2 million franes weat back to Goeringand 1 million to the Baroness von EINEM,and very little alteration was made to thetone of these p pers in a sense favourableto Germany. HIRSCH says that he reportedthese facts to LEMOINE and GIANVETTI of the5eme and 2eme Bureaux respectively, thatneither of these people was allowed to comeforward at his trial, which he said was stageas a red herring by Daladier in order todistract attention from the fact that Dala-dier had tipped off Abetz to clear out ofthe country at a time when his arrest wasimminent. How far this is all true isdifficult to say. The fact remains thatHIRSCH vas given a sentence of 10 yearsand immediately after the German occupationhe was released in order to work withSonderdienst. GILINSKY has been singularlyuncommunicative but personally I do notfeel his case has been examined sufficientlyfrom the point of view of his being a Sovietagent. In addition to his past as a purveyoof arms to the Spanish republicans and ICatalogue Reference:KV/4/1896believe a connection with the Soviet JewelTrust, it is stated in the depositions thathe had visited the Soviet Embassy in Parisand also that his son is now fighting inthe Soviet Army.A further report has come in from the C. in.West Indies about MUNOZ LOPEZ which seemsto show that the Ark Royal incident wasmore probably due to a hand-out in Gib.than to the Natel having leaked at Ankara.J.1.0. have reviewed the possibility 01 anattack on Malta in the light of the largeincrease in aerodromes in southern Italy.It is possible that the Germans might buildup their forces to 550 by the lst Feb. Atpresent they have about 140 first lineaircraft. An attack by air-borne troopsis regarded as a possibility but a hazard-ous one. It seems more likely that theGermans intend to stage a determined attackagainst our naval forces and shipping inthe Mediterranean. If in fact air operationson the Russian front to any degree areimpossible owing to weather conditions,it may be that aircraft are being transferredfrom that area, at any rate during the wintermonths. The assault on Rommel's armies seemsto be taking rather a long time. For someweeks now we have heard that he has onlygot 60 tanks left. This may be accounted forby the fact that the German maintenance unitsare extremely efficient and succeed in gettintheir vehicles into action again. Thereappeare to have been a very fierce fightCatalogue Reference:KVI4/189THIS IS A COPYORIGINALDOCUMENT RETATNED ORIGINALIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTIONao3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958two or three days ago when it was reportedthat we had knocked out 22 German tanks forthe loss of 14, but it now transpires thatwe lost 60 tanks, 50 officers and 300 men.Rommel is certainly putting up a stiff fight.It seems unlikely that we shall take Tripoli-tania, firstly because we have been obligedto send a considerable number of aircraftLO the Far East as well as troops andsecondly because Wavell has expressed avery strong view that Cyrenica is easierto hold as it would be nearer to our base.The cleaning up of Bardia is going onsatisfactorily as also the other places likeSollum and Halfaya in our rear.n Saturday I learned thatproduced two documents which we had plantedon CALVO some two months ago. it is diffi-cult to see why CALVO did not send them toALCAZAR sooner, unless perhaps he wasintending to take them over personally, andowing to the long delay eventually decidedto send them by other means.January 6thI had a long talk with Turner and Haylorabout a number of small matters afiectingthe RPS.Saffery came to see me about a proposal tosend some Post Office officials to Americain order to establish closer relations. - HeCatatogie eRefetenee.v/4718g had referred thisS matter to Allan. I explained to Saffery thatthis IS A COPYORIGINAt DOCUMENT RETAINED271IN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC BECORDSACT 1958.as we were trying to regard the Ameridansas one unit with ourselves, it might bethat an exchange of views on telephones,Fand micro-photography might beprofitable to us both. While I thought itlikely that the Americans could not tell usvery much it was possible that we might beable to help them, to get the best resultsand in this manner indirectly benefitourselves. Saffery seemed to think thata visit would be profitable and undertookto put it to his chiefs. I said that ifit was ultimately decided to send anyone wecould ensure that the delegation got-a fairwind with the Americans.I saw de Purey, an S.I.S. man who has justgot back from Gib. He says that Grey, theassistant D.S.0., is rather worried aboutsecurity in Gib.., particularly about Nortona Gibraltarian who has made himself indispen-Cible to the Governor in the capacity ofSecretary. Norton, though regarded as pro-British, is thought to have something of aneye to the future and to relations withhis Spanish friends to whom he is inclin-ed to ask the Governor to grant facilities.He is always preaching moderation and appease-ment Recently in a case of smuggling tobache advised the Governor not to prosecutethe representatives of a rich Spanish tobaccomerchant and to deal lenientlywith membersof the police who were involved. Grey feelsthat this kind of thing leads to a very laxstate of affairs, and that if people thinkCataegueaefereneeeKt4agg with impunity - they172will certainly smuggle other things. Medlamdoes not seem inclined to stand up to theGovernor in matters of this kind.Victor told me that sir Frank Smith hadasked himto look into the security of animportant RDF development. Ne apparentlyhave a device which reflects anything verticaand which will give a clear indiction whenthe plane is over any particular town, villageor factory.

We havenot had this officially, but we understandthis to be the case. So far the Irish tellus very little. They probably fear that veshould use this case as a pretext for pressinthe Eire Govt. to forego its neutrality andturn the Germans out. There is fairly con-clusive proof that GOERTZ was working inclose conjunction with the I.R.A.January 7thA wire came to say that Dick arrived at Gib.on the 5thWe had a meeting this morning at KinnairdHouse where the question of pioneering JapISOS was discussed. It has pparently beenCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189972decided to send Stratton out. I do not knowwhat brought this about, since it had beenpreviously stated that Madement was quitecapable of doing the work.Felix was present at the meeting, having justreturned from America. He gave a picture ofthe lack of co-ordination in vireless mattersin the U.S.A. It seems that the Army,Naand F.B.I. all have cryptographic depts.and virtually refuse to be amalgamated.Therewas a long discussion about a telegramnfrom Canada which had to be answered. Canadawere anxious to know vhether they were todrop some of their work they were doing for tthe Admiralty and stated that if they were todo any Jap pioneering work they wouldhave to drop the S. Americ n ISOS. A replyhas been sent telling them not to drop anynav 1 work and stating that we can coverthe .American ISOS from here. I said th twas not quite cler on one point. We hadoriginally raised the question of some pion-eering work being done on Jap illicit traffiWhat did the Signals Unit in Canada whichwas going to be employed on this workimagine that it would be able to do inorder to meet our request. It seemed to usthat the main field was in Indo-China,Thaland,Malaya,Burma and India. How fr wouldthe unit in Canada be able to cover thisground? It transpired that we were onlylikely to get communication between northand south America and possibly between mainstations in the Pacific. It seemed howeverextremely doubtful if we should pick upCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18924nything from Singora in Malay or any otherstations that were playing to Bangkok.B.J.S show that there is a powerful stationat Bangkok and others at Hainan,Saigon andSingora. G-P eventually confessed thatour suggestion about pioneering Jap illicittraffic from Canada was merely being usedS apeg by R.S.S. on which to acquire acertain measure of control over the unitin Canada which was not being properlyexploited. It was cleary no good pursuingthe case at Kinnaird House and I propose toraise it again tomorrow at the S.S.meeting.Today's Times mentions that Canaris isintriguing with Gen. Marschner for theoverthrow of the Nazi regime. The informatiocomes from the Times Washington correspondentThe matter is of interest since "C" told mesome little time ago that he had had reasonto think that Canaris might possibly leadan army revolt or at any rate be a party toit. Apart from this there is Krivitski'.sinformation that Canaris at one time wasworking more for the Russians than theGermans.Barra, Spanish Military Attache, has a secre-tary called MUNOZ who is friendly with aman called ROE.

The ISKgroups are apparent.ly in blocks. Whilecertain groups can be dealt with which arein a particular block it does not mean thatgroups in other blocks can be unravelledat the moment. It is however merely amatter of time and the preparation of anindex which may take some to months.I had discussed with Dlunt and Libbs, whoare disturbed outfacilities at Whit-church, and D.4 are taking the view thatthe S.C.0.s office does not provide suffi-cient cover.Brooman-White came to tell me about thesecretary at the Portuguese Ampassador whois perturbed at the advance knowledgeof Spanish journalists about matters ofimportance in particular the journey of theP.M. to america.

These are:1) A Mr. STILLYTLL, local business agent forvarious firms and an honoured member of theBritish community, whose son Francis is theAssistant Naval Attache in Lisbon. It isthought that the son may be quite innocentbut that the father may be extracting infor-mation from him without his knowledge. Theson has been recalled to this country toundergo a Naval course.2) A Mir. M. LAWRENCE, who is No.4 in the U.K.C.C. in Lisbon.3) A Mr. W. Haeburn LITTLE, an Irish artistnow employed in our naval shipping officeat Lisbon. He has been in close touch withSection V officers and knows a great dealabout the S.I.S. organisation in Lisbon.There hasealso been obtained the names of twoship's Captains, concerning Whom it is said we havealready received notification. One of them is namedPECK Or BECK and serves on the "Sylvan Arrow", atanker flying the Panamanian flag.2.We are at the moment principally concerned withW. Haeburn LITTLE, Lieutenant R.N.V.R. who is theConfidential Assistant to the N.C.S.C. Lisbon, and isproceeding lon the yacht "Venus", due to arriveiteGibraitar from Lisbon at noon on Monday, 12th January.Catalogue efenefctoky/Bgenta almost Vireless imediatelyThe yachtto Lisbon.- 2 -5.The card about LITTE which is alleged to havecome from WELTZIEN'S Index gives certain particularsand the numbers of the German agents who are in touchwith him. It also has entered upon it in ink thedates and amounts of payments which LITTLE has receivedfrom WELTZIEN. The Admiralty do not consider that aphotostat copy of this card, obtained through an agentwho cannot be produced, would constitute satisfactoryevidence for a Court Martial unless it could besupported by other testimony. In order therefore toObtain further evidence, the following action i8 beingtaken:1) The "Venus" i8 to be delayed on some plausibleexcuse in Gibraltar, so that LITTLE can havethe opportunity for 48 hours of making contactwithsomebodyinGibraltar.Instructionswillbe issued for him to be kept under observationduring that period.2) An attempt is to be made to photograph allthe cards and a certain number of the files inWEL/TZIEN'B office on Tuesday night.3) LITTLE'S premises in Lisbon will be searchedduring his absence.4) As there appears to be no plausible excusefor ordering LITTLE to return to England andsince if he beeame suspicious it maight bedifficult to force him to leave rortugueseterritory, it has been thought preferableand opportune to allow him to carry out hisnormal duty by proceeding on the yacht "Venus"to Gibraltar. He will then be on Britishterritory and can be dealt with as we thinkfit. It seems particularly desirable that ifpossible his arrest should' not be carried outin Gibraltar, since any action of this kindwould be bound to be a matter of commonknowledge and might seriously embarrassMr. White in the enquiries which he is atCatalogue Referencerk/4/38g It has thenatane- 3 -back to this country. I gather that thisproposition presents considerable difficultiesbut I have pressed the Admiralty verystrongly to regard the whole matter as aajor operation on the rounds that theleakage of information which his now beengoing on for several months in Gibraltar hasreached a stage where it is impossible tosena a signal to the Flag officer withoutgrave risk of its being in the hands of theenemy within 48 hours, and that thereforeit is a matter of paramount importance toavoid any action which mi ght prevent us frombringing our enguinies to a speedy conclusion.The telegramn at 2a has therefore been Bent toColonel Medlam through S.I.S.5) If arrest at sea is impossible, it is proposedto send a further cable ordering the arrestof LITTLE by the Naval Authorities and hisreturn to this country under Navul escort bythe first available means of transport. TheLegal Advisers to the Admiralty consider thathis arrest by the Naval Authorities ispreferable to that by the civil Power whichwould necessitate invoking 18B(a).Instruetions will be issued that every possiblestep is to be taken to prevent the arrestbecoming known, but it is realised that thismay well be impossible. The Captain of theyacht "Venus", unless he burns out to beLITILE himself, will be informed in strictestconfidence and told to provide some suitableexcuse to his officers to account for LITTLE'Sdisappearance. It has been decided thatLITILE should not be interrogated in Gibraltaror informed of the reasons for his arrest.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1899.1.42.THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION279(4 OF THE PUBLIO RECORDSACf 1958S.I.S. state that according to German figuresthe following are German casualties in RussiaKilled, -totally disabled, missing and prison-ers, 1,155,000 up to 15th December.

It has been decided toarrest him before he reaches Burma.January l0thGerald HAMILTON has been released under 18ARestriction Order, in spite of D.G.S letterto Maxwell.N.I.D have agreed to the plan by which LITTLEwill be taken off the yacnt Venus by submarineSenter has asked my advice on the case of anItalian P/W whom he wishes to make use of.This man is air pilot LODDA, who came downin the Mediterranean. He alleges that he isan ardent Sardinian nationalist and providedhe is not asked to do anything involvinggreat risk to himsefor his family is quiteready to SOW seeds of dissension in Sardinia.He dislikes the present regime in Italy.S.O.E'S suggestion is that he should betransferred to a hospital, and that he shouldsubsequently escape, telling the Italians thathe had done SO through the assistance ofone of the nurses who had procured for himmoney and assisted him in leaving thecountry as a stowaway. I have suggested analternative, namely that LODDA should beCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189assisted to leave the country and shouldgive himself up to the Italian Legation inLisbon stating that he had offered hisservices to the British as a means of escape.He would then give them the story of hisescape which the British had told him to putover and would offer his services as a XXworking for the Italians. In fact he wouldcarry with him two different types of secretink, one which he would use as an ItalianXX and the other as a British XXX. Bythis means we should have the advantage ofknowing (a) what the Italians wanted us toknow and (b) the true facts. In all thisof course we are assuming that the Italianis going to play straight with us, a factconcerning which I have considerable doubts.It is by no means impossible that he willbecome not only an Italian XX but an ItalianXXXX.I talked with J.C. and Marriott about thecase of LITTLE and WELTZIEN. On the assump-tion that WELTZIEN was planting his informa-tion on us, he might merely wish to causealarm and despondency in our variousoffices in Lisbon. It occurred to me thatwe might think out some similar plan forcausing alarm and despondency in the Germanoffices.Hart, on looking though the ISOS, has come tothe conclusion that a man referred to as BEBA+PATAR, an agent at Tetuan and possibly one ofthe four in Gib. previously mentioned, maynot after all be working under a pseudonym.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/189283We are therefore telegraphing to Dick askinghim whether anybody of the name of BENATARis known in Gib.January 12thVictor tells me that he visited Rolls lastweek. He was tremendously impressed bythe work they are doing on the Merlin engine.They hold the view that you begin and end thewar with the same engine, since if you designa new one it takes years of modificationbefore you bring it to a state of perfection.They believe in making improvements on agood job in the light of practical experience.They have in this way brought the Mark VSpitfire up to a speed of 415 mph. This isof course capable of far greater speeds whendiving. It has a ceiling of 50,0( ft.Before being passed for sinpection the Merlinengine is put on bhe bench and driven on3,600 rp.m for 2 hours. It is then examinedand tested again for 12-124 hours. If onexamination the slightest wear is detected,the particular part of the engine is scrapped.urn,Bennett and Black came to see me abouta memo which they are putting up to theAdmiralty from the Shipping Committee. Theywere worried about a statement of Hart'sthat it was unlikely that agents werecommunicating shipping news by wireless fromthis country. Frost apparently held acontrary view. The deputation wanted to knowwho was right and who was wrong. I explainedCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189the possibility of wireless from thiscountry and said that while on the wholeI did not think that it was possible for anillicit station to function on a ground waveforvery long, without being detected, therewas no real guarantee on this point, if theset had the necessary wireless cover.January 13thAt the D.G.S meeting today the question wasraised about the enlistment of officers herein the Forces. There might shortly bepressure on the dept. for those between theages of 20 and 30 to be released for activeservice. I said that it seemed to me thatany officers here who had been employed onintelligence duties would very naturallydrift back into intelligence dutiesin thearmy since it vas in the M. I.branches thattheir past experience and knowledge would beput to the best advantage. Could it possiblybe argued that the work that they would bedoing in the field could be of greaterimportance than the work that they aredoinshere. It seemed to me that unless we wereliterally at our last gasp for men and thatthese officers were going to have a rifleput into their hands to fire attthe Germans,there could be no possible excuse for removingthem from their present employment unless theiservices to us did not warrant their retnetionby the department. The same would apply inthe case of the female staff. The probabilitywas that if they joined up in the ATS, WAAFSor WRNS they might well be employed in wash-Catalogue Reference:KVAFr89hey were going to fire285a gun there would not appear to be anypossible excuse for their removal.I thought moreover that we should beregarded as in a privileged position andthat somebody high up should make up theirminds once and for all whether the workof this dept. was of real value to thefighting services or not. If so,nothing should be done which would inany way impair its efficiency. In allthis I thought it was important to realisethat it is impossible to train peoplefor the work of this department under amatter of months or years, since experi-ence is one of the principle assets inwork of this kind. It was decided tohave officers between the ages of 20 and30 examined medically to see how many ofthem would in fact be fit for activeservice. It was suggested that possiblythose who were notalready in uniformshould be given commissions. Charleswas rather against this as he thoughtthat it would give the services a certainhold on the department which was in factlargely a civilian.one It is perfectlytrue that most of our duties are milit uryin the wider sense, except perhaps thosebeing performed by what is known as themilitary branch, but as a matter ofexpediency it would certainly be undesir-able for us to be caught up in themilitary machine. If this happenedwe should find it almost impossible tofunction.I attended a meeting at the attheCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1896Admiralty with .D N.I., Johns andCarpmael, rin alternative plan wasagreed to about LITTLE'S arrest.Itwasdecided that he should be warned half anhour before the Venus sailed that anurgent telegram had been received tellinghim to report for special duty at theAdmiralty and that assince 13 thesubmarine was leaving immediately forEngland he should transfer his kit tothat vessel. He is to be kept underdiscreet observation until he is onboard the submarine and if he attempts todestroy any papers he will have to bearrested. As soon as he gets on thesubmarine he will have to be b serachedby an officer from the Security Serviceand kept under restraint during thevoyage.We had a wire from Dick say ing that he doenot think that he can get much furtherand that he propses to return by the firstavailable pline after the llth. He hasdiscovered that there is a family calledBENATER in Gib. and that the eldestson who works in the NAAF.I. was givena pass into Algeciras from the 14th-17thNovember. These dates would fit in quitewell with the ISOS telegrams. While Lthink this man may well be one of the fouragents in Gib. previously mentioned Idoubt whether he would be sufficientlywell placed to give the rather high-gradeinformation which has been reaching theGermans.

Enquirieswere made through R.S.S. have now revealedthat G.C. &c. C.S. had been regularlyreceiving the Nauen met. reports whichdisclose the existence of a German stationin the vicinity of Cardiff and anotherat Blackpool. The vaious possibilitieshave had to be explored: (1) theGermans decoding our met. reports? Theanswer is that their reports differ slight]from ours. (2) Is it possible for theGermans in the light of the reports thatthey got from places in Europe to beable to report accurately the weatherconditions at Cardiff or Blackpool? Itseems doubtful whether they can. (3) Havethey been making use of the reports of ourown agents? The answer here is that thereports of our agents differ slightly andtheyare not situated in areas referred to.There- are other avenues to explore but atthe moment it looks as if we may have anundetected agent at Cardiff and anotherat Blackpool. If this is SO there is clearly a deficiency in organisation ofCalalogee Relerengar RelerPNG&RKVIAIRE it may be significathat the two stations reported are atDundalk and Cork in the east and southrespectively and that this was the reasonwhy LENIHAN was sent to get weatherreports from Sligo in the west.The government are having a great dealof trouble with de Gaulle about t.Pierreand Miquelon. It seems that in spite ofan undertaking that he would not take anyaction against these islands without theacquiescence of the British Govt., hegave orders to Muselier that this shouldbe done and failed to inform anybody.He has been taken to task by the LordPresident and the Prime Minister has giverinstr ctions that he is to be told toevacuate the islands. The Americans areseriously embarrassed by the incident asthey do not wish tofall out with Vichyat this stage. It seems that the MonroeDoctrine for some reason or anothercomes into the picture.

I said that I was not reallyin a position to discuss this matter Withhim until I had re--read the whole file.I think that he is rather worried by thefact that he has not really been pay ingmuch attention to censorship matters.I arranged with Herbertson to stop Mrs.STILWELL from going to Lisbon over thweekend.I had a long talk With Harris and Milmoabout the case of CASABAYAL, a SpanishRepublican employed by S.0.2. who had goneto the anish Embassy and supplied themwith information about our latest explo-sive and the methods of the Commandos.CASABAYAL has been picked up as a deserterIt seems that he has 5 other accomplicesCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189291)also employed in S.0.2.

One of thesei isLYNCH who is said to have received thesum of 13,000. We regard the informationwith considerable doubt. It has-all-the has the-appearance of a plant.I had a talk with Victor and Ned Reidabout the food racket. The results of ttheir investigations which only touchthe fringe of this racket, are reallyappalling. We .have come into the picturemore or less accidentally and havecontinued certain enquiries in order tohelp Miss Campbell of -the Ministry ofFood, who is supposed to be responsiblefor this work. She is however singularlyill-equipped, having neither the adequatepersonnel or the necessary powers. Shehad in consequence recruited one ratherundesirable employee, who has beenmaking enquiries at banks wth somewhatdisastrous results. Although the foodCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189This IS A COPYIN ORIGINAL DEPARTMENT DOCUMENT UNDER RETAINED SECTION2a?3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 19580racket is rather remotely of securityinterest, it seemsin a way desirable thatwe should take on enquiries for MissCampbell, making use of the H.0.W. and 80aOtherwise she may seriously prejudiceour other more important enquiries withbanks etc. We all came to the conclusionthat the investigation of these matterswould be of little avail unless sevepenalties were imposed on the offencers.I am putting the matter up to the D.G.I lunched today with Felix who had recent-ly returned from America. He told methat his reception from Stephenson wassomewhat cold but that matters improvedconsiderably before his departure. Hehas stated a small section in the NewYork office which he hopes will-bearfruit before long. I asked him about theplacing of XX agents over here among thevarious technicians who were comingtowork in our factories. He told me thatthere had been difficulty in findingsuitable people owing to the short lnm3eof time between wthe is being taken Ors anothe transfer to Canada for shipmentto this country. He has however suggeste.that recruitment might be made firstand that then the agent could apply forsome job in this country.

I gather that Stephenson isCatalogue K94t18ge two officers heas having been sent him "form293London". He does not apparently distinguibetween M.I.5 and M.I.6. Sinclair was ofcourse sent out at S.I.S.S request, andJohn Maude was the best man we had avail-able at the time. I told Felix that I hadbeen questioned by Stepehnson about bothof t em and had told him quite franklythat Sinclair had a good deal of experiencand ability but was a difficult man towork with because he never put any ythingdown on paper and could never be got holdof when he was wanted. He would come inand tell one that he had made some veryuseful contacts but one never got anyaccount of what the contacts had said.ihad also given Stephenson a picture ofJohn Maude and said that Ithought hehad considerable ability and drive butthat he was not the sort of person whocould be let loose on his on. He neededconstant and experienced guidance. Wehad selected him because we thought hewas the kind of person to go down wellin America. Felix said that thesituation had not been improved by S.I.S.planting a dud secretary on Stephenson.She started by collapsing in the heatand when she returned from a fortnightat the seaside she refused to sit in aroom with 2a lot of colonials". AsStephenson is a Canadian this did not godown very well.Felix is going to Lisbon on Saturday.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/189January l6thI had a talk with Curry about VeraERIKSSON. He has seen U. .35 who wouldprefer not to have the F.S.P. man. Hethinks that his presence would destroythe atmosphere.Kellar came to see me and we discussed hisnew job. He seems very enthusiastic.wire has come from Dick saying that heis returning possibly tonight. He hasnot sueceeded in getting any positive cluebut has narrowed the field and put downsome trip-wires in the form of dummymessages left about in FOCNA'S office.I had a long discussion with V.V. andFelix about T.A.R.S relations withDansey. V.V. seemed to think that wehad gone rather beyond our originalsuggestion and Felix did not like ushaving any contact with Dansey at all.I said that I thoroughly appreciated thedangers of having any thing to do withDansey. At the same time I had to tryand find some sort of solution for aproblem which had been worrying me fora long time. For two years Dansey'people had been communicating with theiragents abroad concerning some of whom hemay at least have had doubts. We on theother hand had been communicating with theGerman S.S. on XX lines and endeavouringto answer their questions truthfully butCatalogue Reference:KVI4/189298evasively. It followed therefore thatthose who had daily experience of evadingawkward questions should be best qualifiedto tell S.I.S. whether their questionswere veing evaded in a suspicious mannerthereby implying that their agent wasunder control. In actual fact, thoughwe had both been communicating dailyon our own particular lines neitherof us had seen the other's traffic untilthis had become imperative in the case ofStella LONSDALE. Though we agreed thatnothing but good could come of such anexchange of information and I personallywas convinced on this point, were we toaccept the fact that because of Dansey'spersonality there should be a permanenthiatus and that both organisations shouddsuffer in consequence. I pointed outthat in the case of Stella, had we seenGAESSLER'S traffic we could have told S.I.S. 5 or 6 months ago that they werehaving their legs pulled. Felix saidthat the person who generally told themthis was G-P. I said that quitepossibly he was in a position to givethem hints on this subject from thetechnical point of view but I did not feelthat he was qualified to express anopinion on the contents of the messages.Felix said that he had once got held ofsome of the traffic but that when Danseyfound out he had ordered Jempson toreturn it immediately. He said that C.S S.had given definite instructions toDansey that when one of his agents wasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189abunder control Section V. should beimmediately notified, but that Dansey hadnot carried out these instructions and wasnever likelyto. He was in three mindsas to what to do, (1) whether to have arow with his own chief on the groundsthat he was not seeing that his orderswere carried out (2) to have a row withT./ R. or (3) to let T.A.R. go on and"burn his fingers". He was quiteconvinced that sooner or later Danseywould let us down and and he asked meto make a note of this in my diaryand see whether it would not come truewithin two or three months. Felix isobviously still very sore about theTricycle case. He thinks that he wasunduly badgered for information fromAmerica when there had been an agreementto the effect that we would handle theXX agent in this country and he shouldhandle him abroad. I said that as ageneral line of demarcation this was agood one but that when a man had startedabroad and then come to this countrythen gone abroad again and might verywell come back to this country, itwas obviously desirable to have contin-uity and that overlapping was inevitable.In the case of Tricycle there was anadditional reason, namely that he was clos-ly tied to Balloon and Gelatine andthat if he went they went also. At onemoment he let drop the remark that henever said ything now about XX mattersat the Twenty Committee. I took him upCatalogue on Reference:kii4rtag it was nonsense that997he did not express his views frankly and tthat if anybody working under me resentedhis doing So I should be very pleased todeal with him. I said quite frankly whathad upset our people was that they feltthat when they wished to discuss mattersthey were given the impression that theywere interfering in matters that did notconcern them. Felix admitted that he hadgiven this impression. I said that Ithought it was hopeless as long as thatsort of atmosphere existed. We wereallagreed that functionally we were doingpractically the same work but that fora variety of reasons beyond our controlthe two organisations had to remain underseparate heads. It was there up to usto get over this difficulty by the freestand frankest cooperation. I did not seehow we could work on any other basis.The meeting ended on a perfectly friendlynote, but I am rather disturbed byFelix's attitude, particularly When he say"As long as I am in a separate organisa-tion my loyalties are to my own chief.'I really do not know what he means.V.V. I think was slightly embarrassed bythe whole discussion and tried to impresson Felix that what had gone before couldbe wiped off the slate. I undertook toconsider the question of Dansey and tolet Felix know what I thought his bestline would be. I am inclined to thinkthat he should let T.A.R. "burn his fin-gers". Hewell may but anything else isa counsel of despair.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/189yasSenter came to see me about a party ofNorwegians arriving at Lerwick. Theyare to Load up with 9 tons of explosiveswhich they are taking back to Norway.He wanted to obtain sanction for theirnot being sent to the Patriotic Schools.I only hope they are not all German agentsLennox gave me the news. The Russiang aredoing really well, and the reports inthe newspapers about them are fairlyaccurate. A force is being prepared ofabout 90,000 which ill assist the Frenchin N. Africa if they are willing to beassisted. At the moment the Americans arebeing urged to deal with Madeira andthe Canary Isles. Our forces are to goon to Tripoli and possibly also toBizerta. Rommell's force is estimatedby the W.O. at 59,000 but by Auchinleckat about 36,000. but there is anotherforce of about 34,000 in Tripoli.

This man appears to have aC.R.O. record. When his baggage wassearched at his lodging certain plansand specifications relating to the Whittleengine were found. He appears alsoto have been employed at one time bythe Daimler Co. and also by Rolls-Royce.He is now said to be looking for a shipof the Ellerman line which sails to theIberian Peninsula. It is just possiblethat he has been collecting inform tionwhich he intended to take away to Spain.He is being looked for and will bearrested when found.January 17thI had a talk with Victor,T Theresa Clay,T.A.Fand Roberts about Mrs. ROY JOHNS. It wasdecided that at a convenient moment Robertsshould reveal that he is an agent of theGestapo who is contacted periodically bya man whose identity he does not know, andCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1893o0that his business here is to check up onthe reliability of certain people whom theGermans think might be ready to assistthem in time of invasion. We decided thathe had better not have any special cred-entials except perhaps a draft on the SwissBank corporation for several bundredpounds. Details of this are to be workedout by Ned.Some days ago we discovered that thetransmitter which had previously beenactive in Kensington Palace Road wasin actual fact operating from the topfloor of the boviet Consulate, RosaryGardens. We had previously asked theSoviet bmbassy hether they were trans-mitting on the call signs given but theyhad given us a denial. We have decidednot to register any protest but tolisten in for the time being in orderto see what happens. So far there hasbeen no answer to the Call signs. I.S.S.seem to have failed us rather badly inthis case since theirmonitoring servienever reported the signals. It wasonly because we happened to have foundout through having vans out in searchof signals from the Jap Embassy that weknew anything about it.Eddie Grant rang me up about IBARRONDOand CAMPOS. He seemed worried abouttheir being interrogated and left atlarge and pointed out that the deportatiororder implied that they should be heldCatalogue Refereheetkv47189 the time they were put361on the plane.

We both agreed to thinkit over and communicate again in themorning.Dick has returned full of gloom aboutthe state of security in Gib. Althoughthe situation is obviously a verydi ficult one there is no doubt thatthe Naval Office leave their telegramslying about ell over the place and therewas an incident recently when some oftheir cyphers were found in the dustbin.Also VACNA has a battlelheadquartersin the Rock where he keeps a duplicateof every telegram. These duplicateslie on a shelf in his dugout, the key ofwhich is left in the hands of theSecurityPolice Since four of the latterhave recently been convicted of smugglingand most of them are Gibraltarians thispractice is to say the least somewhatunwise. Appropriate measures are nowbeing taken. The circulation of natelshas not been restricted. Almost every-body on the Rock seems to have hadaccess to them in the past. The C. incideas on security are also somewhatprimitive and Dick quite rightly refusedto discuss his business in the presenceof Harry NORTON, the C. in C's Gibraltariapolitical adviser, who is all in favourof pacifyin the Spaniards. He may bequite loyal but he is certainly theCatalogue EREeference.Kvi4hfog for the job. Looking through30:Medlam's files Dick came across thecase of a spaniard who had been caughtgoing out of the dock area with detailsof shipping movements etc. He wasarrested and put in prison pending anopinion by VACNA on the value of his in-formation. Before this opinion wasreceived the Spaniard was released onthe orders of the C. in C. and put actthe frontier. Doubtless NORTON wasthe Adviser in this case. C. in C'sother adviser is uennel, the S.0.2 manwho was responsible for blowing up theGerman wireless mast at Tangier recentlyQuennel is rather an undesirable personand has probably made a certain amount ofmischief as between Grey,Medlan's assis-tant D.S.O. and the C. in C. Grey isvery concerned and probably rightlyabout the whole state of security in thefortress and is quite ready to say so,but Medlam is a little inclined toacquiesce in the views of the C. in C.who very often refuses to take his adviceon security matters.Dick has made one interesting discoverynamnely that by the study of the form ofour naval cypher messages reporting themovements of ships between this countryand Gib. and Gib. and the eastern Med.it might be possible to work outthemovements and destination of ships,although their numbers and class mightnot be clear. This would account for atleast one of the ZPT messages. This is aCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189THIS IS A COPYRIGINALDOCUMENT RETAINETIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION303ACT 19583 (4) OF THE PUBLICRECORDS PUBLIOclear illustration of how impertant itis for us, if we are going to investigatecases of this kind, to know more about theform of SPT messages. I am going to tryand arrange this but I shall doubtlessmeet with a good deal of opposition, fromDenniston and company. Incidentally alarge number of people at Gib. seem toknow about the ZPTs and the nature ofIDOS is known more widely.Dick has made some very useful investiga-tions and prepared the ground for a searchand arrest of some 8 or 9. people in twoor three weeks time if we do not obtainpositiveevidenc against them in themeantime.I was rung up at about 1030 by the NDOwho had received via S.I.S. a telegramfromat Lisbon to the effect thatW/C Lord Carlow was flying over fromLisbon with the wax impressions of twokeys.

He willnot however leave the premises untilMathews. has had a look round himself.Both suspects will be told that thereis a deportation order against them andthat arrangements are being made for themto leave within a week. After the docu-ments have been examined they will beinterrogated. -If of course any thingincriminating is found they can bearrested.e I hope to get the F.0. toagree toour:having them in custodyfor twentyfour hours at least beforethey leave.

They will be metby the RSLO and taken to the SCOs office.I now hear that the plane from Lisbonis likely to land in Devon owing to fog.I have therefore arranged with the SCOto bring Lord Carlow to Bristol by car.There is a further complication sincethe plane leaving for Lisbon tomorrow isa freight plane and cannot carry anypassengers without the express permissionof the hir Ministry. This means that thekeys will have to go back in charge ofthe pilot and his assistant, who are bothDutch. I am trying to arrangeto have thekeys put in the BOAC bag, since not onlywould it be difficult to get Air Ministrypermission for a passenger to travel butthe passenger would require a Portuguesevisa which would be quite impossibl toobtain by 9 a.m. I spoke to MajorFerguson at 4.15 and explained theposition, suggesting that he shouldtelegraph to Lisbon.The D.G. had a conference with Pilcherand myself about the Stella LONSDALE case.Catalogue He Referencekvr4/18gou whether I thought30she should be interned, since in viewof the trouble there has been about BenGREENE he does not wish to have any morebackwash on an 18B case. I said that Ithought that while itwas quite likelythat as long as she remained in thiscountry she would not dare to engage inespionage, she was such an adventuressthat she might well try and escape toIreland and get back to France inthat way. If we left her at large weshould have to keep her under constantobservation which would waste a good dealof valuable time and cause immensetrouble. S.I.S. were firmly of opinionthat they did not want her back in Francewhere she had probably already done theirorganisation a good deal of harm. Tobyput the matter rather well by kingthat if she were left at large and shedid do anything detrimental to thiscountry we should undoubtedly be blamedfor not putting her case forward forinternment. Our experience of thiswoman after endless interrogation,listening to telephone conversationsand mike conversations, is that sheis quite unequalled as a liar. and thatshe is either a dupe or an accomplice ofthe German S.S., more probably an accom-plice. D.G. was anxious that we shouldlet the Home Secretary realise that theCommittee might possibly decide in thiswoman's favour if she were internedunder lOB. He had this very much inmind owing to the case of Ben GREENE whoCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189307has been released with apologies. One ofthe principal witnesses, KURTZ, wasseverely cross-examined by Birkett on hisstatement made 18 months ago. On certainpoints his memory not unnaturally mighthave been expected to have been at faultand on one particular point he slightlymodified his previous view. This seemsto have been the occasion for Birkett,without due regard to the whole circum-stantes of the case and without submittingBen GREENE to cross-examination, to makewhat can only be described as an onslaughton the unfortunate KURTZ and to tear hisevidence to pieces in the technical sense.Toby has little doubt that the committeewere just lying/for an M.I.5 informantand there is no doubt whatever that evenif AURTZ'S evidence is not accurate inevery particular he was certainly presentat a treasonable conversation with GREENE.One of the points that Birkett completelyignored was the fact that GREENE said thathe had telephoned to Scotland Yard report-ing KURTZ'S visit.Scotland Yard had saidthat no such message had ever beenreceived. Birkett seems to have acceptedBen GREENE'S denial almost without questionIt is thought that there has been a gooddeal of encouragement of Birkett's attitudeby Newsam who has already expressed hisdisapproval of what he calls Agent-provocateur mehhods in the case of theRev.DY MOCK. This whole business of GREENEshows only too clearly how hopeless it isto establish any reasonable degree ofsecurity under this quasi-legal system byCatalogue eReferenCErRa4ri8g and its witnesses arsubjected to severe cvoss-examinationwhereas the word of the accused isaccepted without question. It was onlyafter the Home Secretary had writtenhis letter of apology that we were calledinto conference.January 19thI was rung up at 8.30 by Ferguson'ssecretary who said that a message hadbeen reeyyed during the night asking thatthe keys should not be sent in the BOACbag but handed to the Dutch pilot whoshould be told to give them to FordAnderson of the BOAC in Lisbon. thisdid not seem to be such a good arrange-ment as the onemade the night before,namely to send The keys in the BOAC bagaddressed to the Embassy, but we com-plied with the request from the otherside. At 10 O'clock however we gota call from the aerodrome to say thatthe freight plane would not be leavingtoday owing to fog at Lisbon. It wastherefore decided to let the arrange-ment stand for the following day andI rang up Ferguson in order that hemight send a wire to Lisbon.Eddie BGrant rang up to say that thepremises of IBARRONDO and CAMPOS had beensearched without result.

Victor said quite properlythat he was submitting this matterto the D.G. since the proposal involvedthe tunning of six men under the D.S.0.at Gib. and their payment. Swinton thentold him that the placing of this matterbefore the D.G. was just a formalityand that he (Swinton) gave him an orderto get on with it at once.

Copies of these messageshad reached us through S. I.S. Madrid.They purported to come from Newcastle,Edinburgh, Liverpool and London, anddealt with shipping matters. They appearto be the type of information that comesfrom the Spanish Consul. An interestingfact is that these messages, withslightly altered dates, have appeared asJap B.J.S from Madrid to lokio, informatihaving been sold to the Japs by Alcazar.We also discussed the position of CALVo ithe light of certain B.J.

Personally I think he should takethe documents with him, but there willdoubtless be objections from Section V.Wethered has telephonedabout the case ofCOOK @ SCOTT.

He wanted to knowwhether these people were being deportedas areprisal. Makins said that we didnot usually embark on a policy of repri-sals but that had we wished we could inview of the treatment of British subjectsin Spain have ample grounds for doing SO.There had also been a protest addressedby some M.P. to the H.0. and represen-tations had been made to Madrid to SamHoare. I explained to Makins that it wasat the request of the F.O. that wehad put up the names of IBARRONDO andCAMPOS for deportation on purely retalia-tory grounds. We had been careful notto select proven spies as this by implica-tion would naturally place the Britishsubjects in that category. We hadpicked on IBARRONDO and CAMPOS becuase theyseemed to be more or less of a similarstatus and were members of the Falange whohad been the subject of some at ention.The searches had given a negative result,but we felt very strongly that our positionwould be considerably weakened if thethreat of deportation were not carried outand if it were not made clear to theSpaniards that these people were not beingdeported necessarily because they haddone something against this country butbecuase the Spaniards had deported twoinnocent British subjects. y Makins seemedrather keen that we should get rid ofCAMPOS and allow IBARRONDO toremain. Wesaid that we thought this would be equallyCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1893146unsatisfactory. He did not think thathe could agree to the deportation of bothwithout first referring the matter toSam Hoare. I said that if this werethe case it would be better to postponethe departure of both as I was not anxiousto make any distinction if this could beavoided. This course of action was finallagreed upon and the F.O. undertook tocancel the seats on the plane on the 4h25th and to reserve others in 10 daystime. I told Makins that had the F.O.not in the first place told us that they Wwanted the names of two Spaniards ofequal status who were to be expelledin retaliation for action against twoinnocent British subjects we should haveput up entirely di ferent people. Hewas bound to admit that a mistake hadbeen made in his absence.I went over to see "C" with Dick in view ofthe suggestion that Codrington should goout to Gib. to take over a part of S. S.I.S.activities from Medlam. Dick gave ageneral picture of the situation. "C"was rather worried at the general set-upand the fact that the Governor obtainedmost of his advice from Harry NORTON andQUENNELL. I gather that PWE were sendingout Medlicott presumably to do progagandain N. Africa and Spain. It seems that hewill also be joining the general confusionof functionswhich seems to exist, and thathe will almost certainly quarrel withQuennell.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/18931I had a word with "C" afterwards about thenecessity of our being given someopportunity of studying the form of ZPT,but I had no time to go into this indetail. I explained that it was impossibleto conduct the kind of enquiries which weresent to us by the Admiralty if we did notknow more about the general form of thesesignals.Lennox is rather gloomy about Singapore.The Chiefs of Staff have apparently givenWavell carte blanche to do whatever hethinks fit. If he feels Singapore shouldbe evacuated he should act accordinglywithout any regard for political considera-tions.

Whilethe staff are quite security-minded,there is very little physical securityeither for the documents or for theexperimental aircraft.

Boddingtorhad seen COOK and had come definitelyto the conclusion that he had not obtainedthe documents for improper purposes. Infact he had all the information, and agood deal more, in his head. It seemedtherefore undesirable to take proceedingsagainst technical him offence. on account It of seems a purely moreoverclear that if a charge were brought againsCatalogue him imRefnermisktysayglly might well be brought321against Power Jets Ltd. under Section2(1)c of the Official Secrets Act, onthe grounds that having notes and plansused in a prohibited place they had failedto take reasonable care for the safetyof these documents. It transpired thatthey had a boy of 16 in charge of theirplans and sometimes these plans were inthe possession of members of the stafffor a number of days. There was nothingto prevent the staff from taking the plansout of the factory. It was decided toallow the police to proced with theircharge of false pretences in that COOKhad organised a raffle for a motor-bikewhich did not exist and had absconded withthe funds, but that no other chargeshould be preferred.

I thought he might allgo to Lagos and come back via the MiddleEast. I am going to put this up to theD.6.I had lunch with Lakin and discussed withhim the case of CASABAYO and the possibiliof introducing someone else to take hisplace. Lakin said that he would makeenquiries and see what could be done. Hehoped that we should intern CASABAYO atCatalogue Referenee:kvatiigg He then told me323about Whetmore who has been appointeda G.S.0.2 at Gib. in order to co-ordinateour Army,a and Air Intelligence underthe Governor. Lakin got rid of Whetmorebecause he insisted on making all sortsof enquiries on his own and impingingon our preserves. He thinks that Whetmorewill almost certainly be a source oftrouble to Medlam. He will never stickto his own job and will certainly inter-fere on the security matters in Gib.I had a talk with Brooman-White andMilmo about CASABAYO. They were veryanxious to put in a substitute now beforeBRUGADA returned from Madrid. Theythought it might be interesting if hecould get into touch with Barra. Thesuggestion is that ultimately he shouldput forward a proposition for buildingup a sabotage organisation in this countryHe would provide explosives from SOE, ifthe spaniards and their friends wouldindicate the targets. He would impressupon them that sporadic outbreaks were notmuch good, but careful preparation wouldbe made for the invasion. Explosives coulbe stored somewhere in the meantime andthen placed in position a few days beforesero. This woud enable us(1) to satisfythe enemy that they had a sabotage organ-isation in this country (2) avoid thenecessity for staging explesions (3) indi-cate the targets which were of interestto the enemy and (4) give us an earlywarning of invasion.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/18932u3Felix has put forward the suggestion thatSTILWELL should be discredited in Lisboninstead of being recalled here byThorneycrofts. It is thought that if astory is put about that he is in the payof the Germans he will protest hisinnocence and may wish to come back tothis country to clear himself. He couldthen be thoroughly interrogated.Dick has had a dream. He was walkingthrough Trafalgar Square with Felix, whento his horrow and amazement he heardsomeone shouting "ISOS.! ISOS". As hecame round the corner he saw Herbert Hartselling copies at ld. each. He expressedhis regret for this incident and said hewould look into the matter as soon ashe got home Felix merely replied "Oh don'tbother. I always knew that this sort ofthing was going on".January 27thI attended the D.G.S meeting. Thequestion of B.] registry was raised.08A complaint had been received from sectionin the country that they could not seeB. files unless they came up to London.It was finally agreed that each caseshould be treated on its merits, and thatthe section concerned should say whetherthe file should besent down or not.

It has also been Suggested thatwe might have a finger-printindexwhich could quite easily be provided sinceall Spaniards entering the Foretresshave passes with their finger-prints onthem. If a bomb was found finger-printsmight provide a useful check. There has aalso been a case of sabotage at LorenzoMarques. This place is evidently extreme-ly important since we know From othersources that the Germans are spending 5200a day on cables between Lorenzo Marquesand Berlin: It seems very desirable thatS.I.S. should have some liaison with thisplace.Father has been asked to indicate the mapsquare in which he carries out his patrolsThe answer is being considered.The wireless set whichwe put up to imper-sonate BASKET has not been operating for6 days.

It is a tendency of olaBlackford's to fiadle about with thesethings till he cannot solve them or getsbored and then give us the mangledremains. If the information is trueit clearly needs investigation byourselves.Felix told me that he had seen hisChief about the use ofand othersin Madrid for Section work.

Felix is discussingthis matter with Swinton.Hart has ascertain that our dd friendHENDERSON-O the Censorship who wasnotorious for his pro-German and Pacisviews, has now landed up in the officeof Sidney Barnes permanent secretaryto the Admiralty.

He would thenwork under Medlam.I saw Maxwell this afternoon and discussedthe case of Vera. He said he wouldarrange for the rescinding of the 12(5)a.order and for the issue of an 18Arestruction order. We were to writehima letter giving him the necessary partic-ulars. He would also arrange for thetransfer to hyslbury.I also talked to Maxwell about SEMMELBAUEFand MAASS and a Home for Incurables. Hesaid he would explore the possibibitiesof establishing two Nazi camps, one forthose over 50 or 55 and the other forthose who would not normally form partof an repatriation scheme. If this couldnot be arranged it was tentativelyagreed that we should take the risk ofsending S. and M. to the Nazi camp.Maxwell also undertook to explore theposition with regard to a camp for womenincurables.Maffey in a conversation with Walshe hasmade some suggestion thaty we were notaltogether satisfied that Ireland wasnot being made a base for espionageCatalogue Reference:KVI4/189330against this country in contravention of tthe express wishes of the President.Walshe has suggested that somebody shouldgo over and discuss the matter.

I am urging (1) that thereshould be no further publicity except wherwe consider it desirable and (2) thatthe execution of spies should be theexception rather than the rule, sincestand to lose much through not havingthem available for further interrogation.There have been two ISOS messagespurporting to show that the Germans havelearned from an agent in this countryabout the movement of large convoys toAfrica. The information is So grosslyinaccurate as to be completely valueless.Some of the ships mentioned have alreadybeen sunk and most of the remainder arein completely different parts of theworld. Since the information was passedby Berlin to Madrid three days after thearrival of CALVO in Lisbon it may bethat CALVO gave the information localJeto the Germans in order to build him-self up.There is also a report from our M.A A. inStockholm to the effect (1) a loyalNorwegian detective with contacts withGerman police in Oslo has stated that 2Norwegians in London in high positionsbelong to the Gestapo.

There may be many explanationsof the second part.T.A.R. has raised the question of ourputting an agent or representative intoLisbon, who would work in close liaisonwith Section V.

It was On receipt of thisinformation that he went home and didhimself in.February 2ndCraufurd came to see me about photos andfilms. I told him that I had put thewhole case up with a suggestion that itmight be possible to have a discussionon the Executive. My view was that eitherthe M.O.I. should agree to our sugges-tion about retaining all photos and filmswhich were not for publication in theircustody on behalf of the papers and firmsconcerned and make it illegal for suchfilms or photos to be held up by any outsidebody or that the problem should betackled from the other end and steps takento see that photos and films were nottaken of objects which were of a secretor confidential nature.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/189335Vera was told by Cookie about herproposed move.

The wholequestion seems to me to have got intothe most frightful muddle. My inclina-tion was to tear the file into littlepieces and start all over again. Itis proposed that Harry should relinquishcertain of his duties as D.I M. I. (S)War Office, and give more time to thosewhich he performs as D.O &c D. Thenecessary adjustment is to pe madewithin the N.0. but he will still retainhis W.O. title. an attempt has beenmade to define the duties of room 055but there seems to be a good deal ofconfusion about Orr's position. Harry'sview is that he does not wish him to inte:-lere in what are purely W.O. securitymatters. In other words matters whichHarry supervises as D.D.M.I.( I. (S).Catalogue ReferEnCe:KVI4/189337Personally I do not know what his dutiesare in this purely W.O. capacity. AsD.C.&c.D. he is supposed to be in chargeof a section, M.

Sincehowever the D.G. has said that the WarBook is the rubric, it is difficult toimagine how we shall ever get theposition straight.Dick and I went over to see the D.N.I.in order to discuss Dick's report onGib. D.N.I. wishes to put in a motionto the JL.C. calling attention to thematter of security in Gib. He thoughtthis might lead to a signal from theChief of Staff which would generallyput people more on their toes. He seemsto have his knife into old VACNA.According to ISOS some act of sabotagein Tangier appears to be boiling up.We have decided to send a telegram toMedlam warning him about the possibilityof something happening to the Rescue, aferry bo t which plies between Gib. andTangier.

It is to be pintedin Switzerland. Lennox has got holdof Gribble and will tell him to stopthe publication. If the book circu-lates in Germany there is a possibilitythat what has been overlooked may come tolight.I had a discussion with Cecil, Victor,Burt and Fish about sabotage and othersubversive activities at the factoryof Harland Shortt in Belfast. Twoemploye ees who have been reporting bothto the management and to the policeeventually went to the local M.A.P.representative and we were asked tomake enquiries. fish is convinced thatthere is a gre it deal in the storiesof the two informants.

Inaddition to the reports on England therehad been reports on Ireland. These nadnow been eliminated through the dis-covery that aircraft were present at thetime and in the vicinity Of the placesfrom which readings had been taken.There seems to be at least a 50% chancethat there is an agent in the Croydonarea and one in the Blackpool area, sincethe barometric readings have clearly beenmade from the ground. Some of themessages are sent at the same time asMet. reports sent by our on agents butthere are a number of others whichcannot be accounted for.I had a talk with Cecil and Dick aboutthe visit to Ireland.

I said that I did notreally know whether I was supposed todeal direct with the D.M.I. or whetherI was supposed to use him as a bottle-neck for everythin connection with theW.O. He seemed to think that I shouldhe direct access as a rule but thatsometimes aavice or introductions throughhis section mignt be better. I pointedout to him that my duties were in a sensemore military than his. He agreed upto a point. I suggested that we mightput out a periodical report on counter-espionage for the information of D. Hethough t this would be a good idea.We had a second meeting of the BlanningCommittee. It was decided that we shouldissue a 6-monthly report and that weshould aim at getting out the firstnumber in conjunction with S.I.S. onabout the lst May. In reply to my queriesabout Spanish B.J.s and Jap Naval B.J.sI was told that the Spanish was unbreakablwithout the re-ciphering table but thatthere were hopes about therJap cypher.Felix told us that Section V. now-hada man at nio, Monte Video and Panama,and were trying to arrange for one to goto .A.is to take over americanCatalogue e Reference:kV46189.3urI talked privately to Vive about theZPTs.

It is understood thatMr.Coe will cover all security matterswhether they concern the Forces orcivilians, but personally I have doubtswhether the American Services willcollaborate as they should. CertainlyCol.Case, the Military Security represen-tative, is taking a very independentline. I made it clear that we did notwish this American Security Bureau hereto interfere in any way with our liaisonwith the Americans which was at presentconducted through Stephenson. Any duplicition of the ch nnels wouldobviously lead to trouble. As I envisagethe American Searity organisation here,it would deal with all questions affect-ing the personnel of the various missionsin this country and their reliabilityfrom the Security point o1 view.

Matnews talked abouthis recent post at Vichy. He said theplace was a mass of rumours and "ballonsd'essaie". There were so many wheelswithin wheels that it was extremelydifficult to sort out the good news fromthe bad. Mathews did however thinkthat opinion was beginning to hardenagainst Cermany. I asked him what effecthe thought that the bombing of factorieswhich were working for the Germans wouldhave on the population in France. Hesaid that he was inclined to think itwould have a had effect, particularlyif the bombing took place in the vicinityof ports and a number of innocent civiliarwere killed.There have been some interesting P/Wreports. Very strange conversationsbetween von Ravenstein and Schmitt, twoGerman Generals captured in Libya.Both of them seem to dislike Rommelintensely. They regard him as an arriv-iste who by pressing his troops to dowhat is almost impossible hopes to makea name for himself. He had apparentlyset his heart on taking Tobruk, andincurred very heavy casualties in theattempt. He is evidently a man of ironwill and ruthless in getting rid of any-body who does not conform to his ideas,and is in every way an unsympatheticcharacter.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/189JubIt seems that the Vera case is going onwell. The lady is doing her best tohelp though it seems likely that she hasnot got a very intimate knowledge ofthe organisation.February 7thThere has been a colossal explosion on thequay at Tangier. >he ferry-boat Rescuehad arrived and the luggage was takenoff. Directly afterwards the explosiontook place. At the moment it is notclear who was responsible. There anumber of people killed.S.I.S. now tells us that the chauffeurin the LITTLE case was introduced by aPortuguese employee in our Legationwho was in touch with WELTZIEN who wasdistrusted. This seems to cause seriousdoubts to be cast on the originalinformation and is an aspect of the casewhich should have been made clear to 10and N.I.D. at the start.I had a discussion with Dick andVictor about Rats, Peg and Sundae.We decided that Rats should be introducedinto the Fortress and that Burt shouldbe sent to Gib. to prepare the case inconjunction with Medhurst.

STEINER has been at large about8 months but we have now picked him up.February 8thBoth J.C. and Milmo put in reports aboutthe suggested arrest of CALVO. J.C. isstrongly opposed to the whole projectas he feels it will seriously embarrassthe work of the Twenty Committee owingto CALVO'S previous connection with G. W.Milmo on the other hand takes the viewthat some action is necessary againstthe Spanish ring being run by Alcazar.Personally I do not feel that the arrestof CALVO is going to have very seriousrepercussions. Onbalance I am in favourof the arrest. We cannot allow hisactivities and those of his associatesto run on indefinitely.

It is desiredto give the impression that he hasdouble-crossed the Spaniards.I had a word with Ferguson about theLITTLE case and explained to him thatit was almost impossible to proceeduntil we got the documents and withthe assistance of certain people fromLisbon who had the full details of thecase.February 9thAccording to the Times there has beera demonstration of Arabs in Tangier onaccount of the bomb outrage, and a breakingup of British property. I understandthat we have sent warships to Tangier todemonstrate.I saw Stewart this morning and discussedwith him the proposed meeting of theJ.I.C. on Security at Gib. I said thatI thought it was important not to stirCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3413 (4 OF THE PUBLICRECORUSACT 1958up a lot of mud which might result inmaking Medlam's position more difficultthan it was already: We also discussedthe Tangier incident. ISOS seems toindicate that the Germans know nothingabout it. I am told however by Archiethat S.O.E. have communicated with theirpeople who deny responsibility for anyexplosion of such magnitude.I had a discussion with Felix aboutALCAZAR and his liquidation. Felix isstrongly in favour of Philby' scheme.Iwas at first rather opposed to it onthe grounds that if our informationcoming from that quarter was of valueit would be better .to leave ALCAZAR inposition SO that we should learn whatsteps he was taking to reform theorganisation ver here: after the arrestof CALVO. Felix pointed out howeverthat he had a rather special- interestin the matter since ALCAZAR was alsorunning an organisation in S. America.He thought therefore that steps whichwould beopardise ALCAZAR' positionwould be of value. I therefore agreedto the course suggested.Irma STAPLETON has got 10 years.I dined with U35 when Vera's case wasdiscussed.

They agreed with the coursesuggested, but felt that they would beon poor ground if they attempted torefuse access to the prisoner. by anymember of the Spanish Embassy. In thuafternoon we had a full discussion witthe D.G. 9 Harker, Allan,J. 9 Dick and my-self. J.C. made an impassioned speechfor the Twenty Committeein which heopposed-the arrest of CALVO. I explained aall the prosu and cons- and said that I wasquite positive that action should betaken. The D.G. seemed to be still indoubt and. sent for T.AR. who-saidsthat asa representative of B. lA he could onlyexpress a view from his own particularangle. He was therefore opposedt thearrest.

They are toget employment in the factories andmerely slow up production by ca'cannymethods. They have special instructionsagainst taking any sort oi violentaction which might only lead to theexecution of a number of innocent people.February llth.I had another meeting with Codrington,Malkin and Strang. The F.0. said thatthey could not give any guarantee thatthe Embassy would not be allowed to visitCalvo but if they were pressed theywould do their best to stall things aslong as they could. This point was putto Eden who agreed. The F.O. agreed thatCASTILLO should be searched. The questiorof CALVO carrying a bag was then discussedIt was agreed that the bag should betaken from him and returned to theSpanish Embassy by the F.O. The F.O.would say that they had opened it as itwas being carried by a man who had beenarrested as a spy. I have discovered thatOnofre GARCIA is employed by the CubanMinister and therefore has diplomaticprivilege. Unfortunately the Ministeris away in Torquay recovering frominfluenza. It will therefore be neces-sary to get hold of the secretary who willgo to the F.O. and telephone for approvalof GARCIA(S arrest and search on theLegation premises. I discussed with theD.G. the possibility of deporting CALVOif he were not onfronted with CALVO.Catalogue Reference:k Reference:kV/4/189352It was decided to proceed as arrangedand consider this point at a later stageif necessary. I spoke to "C" and askedhim to let us have his approval of thewhole CALVO project in writing.The news about Singapore is bad, andthe situation in Libya is not too good.aI saw the D.M.I. today about theCALVO arrest and the views of the TwentyCommittee. He did not take a gloomyview about G.W. and seemed quite satis-fied about our going ahead.We have had passed to us throughStephenson some cryptic telegrams sent froPortsmouth, New Hampshire,U.S.A to aMiss Bell NEWBOLD. daughter of the Vicarat Newbury , and to someone else calledMrs. STUART, from one Geoffrey STUART.There is some suggestion that thesemeasages relate to the fire on the"Normandie".February 12thI heardtthat last night Stewart wasworry ing about CALVO. Heis afraid thatin view of the Tangier incident theremay be serious repercissions on hisownnorganisation. I therefore went overto see him. He had by that time spoken toCadogan and seemed somewhat reassured.I said that I thought that I was rightand that as all the plans were made we reaCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189353really ought to go ahead. He agreed.He told me that S.0.E. were definitelyresponsible for the Tangier incident.It seemed that in addition to limpetsthe "Rescue" had taken over a certainamount of gun cotton and detonators.Owing to the atmospheric conditionsthe gun cotton ignited and there weredisastrous results. Quennels howeveris resigning and S.O.E. have been toldthat they are to cease all operationsfor the time being in Spain and Portugal.The R.S.S. meeting today but I did notattend for very long. Nothing ofspecial impo tance was discussed.D.M.I. telephoned to me to say that hehad gone into the question of indiscre-tions by certain of his officers whenspeaking to BARRA. He said he was cer-tain that they had not given anythingaway. The impression he gained was thatBARRA as trying to blow himself upin the eyes of his own authorities.D.M.I. hid issued a special warning toall his officers who might be concernedto be careful of what they said beforeBARRA in future.I saw the D.N.I. for a moment about theproposed arrest of CALVO and its possiblerepercussions on the work of the TwentyCommittee. He agreed that we wereright in going ahead. He did not thinkthe risks involved were very great.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/189354I had a meeting with Maxwell about thecase of Sam STEVART. He was inclined toagree that it was difficult to get overthe evidence of the Snow traffic whichseemed to indicate that STEWART had atone time or another had dealings withthe Germans.I heard at about 3 p.m. p. that CALVO hadbeen arrested on arrival. I spoke toStephens and told him th t if possiblewe should like to have a statementsigned by CALVO at the earliest possiblemoment as to whether there are any instructions concerning espionage activities herecoming in BRUGADA'S bag. I also told himthat no mention was to be made of G. W.in the interrogation. I impressed onhim that it would be useful if we couldget something in the nature of a confessioof guilt, a.s this would strengthen thehands of the F.O. in dealing with theEmbassy. F.O. are anxious to weigh inbefore the Embassy protest. We havetold them that they can say that CALVOhas been arrested as a spy workingunder ALCAZAR who is working for theGermans.The Twenty Committee have held their weeklmeeting today, and are rather upstageabout the arrest of CALVO. They havepassed a resolution asking for directivesfrom the W.Board owing to the aateredcircumstances. I spoke to the D.M.I.who thinks that the Twenty CommitteeCatalogue are Reference.kV eferngcaKkrAEgrated taking view of theTHIS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENI RETAINEDNDEPARIMENT UNDER3 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS355ACT 19582os0situation. He wants me to speak to themand calm them down.February 13thAt 8 a.m. the N.D.O. rang up to say thatCALVO had signed a comprehensive state-ment at 6.45 a.m. He did not reachCamp 020 until about L a.m. Later Isaw the statement which throws the blameon others and tries to imply thatCALVO has merely been an unwillingintermediary in various acts of espionageCALVO states that on several occasionsthe bag has been used by diplomats andothers for the transmission of informa-tion from this country. which would beof use to the Germans.I had a meeting with Cadgan, Strang,Loxley and Malkin at which it was agreednot to touch BRUGADA'S bag, An extremelyawkward situation would be reached ifhe refused to give itiup and we wereforced to take it from-him from him by violence:In view of CALVO' statement it wasagreed that in addition to saying thathe had been arrested for espionagecarried out under the instructions ofAlcazar for the Germans we should saythat we had definite evidence that thediplomatic bag had been used forimproper purposes, and request the Embassyto carry out an investigation. It wasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189asbfurther decided that he might perhapsbegin by an examination of the bag ofMr. BRUGADA, which was ariving today.A D. .Notice is to be issued to thePress telling them not to publish anyreports of the CALVO incident.I lunched with Canning and told hiabout CALVO'S case. In a generalwayhe seemed quite satisfied about therelations between our two departments.I had a talk with J.C. about the TwentyCommittee resalution. I said that Ihardly felt there was a case to go beforethe .Board. The li.Board ad-primarilybeen set up in order to direct theTwenty Committee on major questions of po-policy and discretion, and I did notwish it to duplicate more than it hadalready done the work of the TwentyCommittee on a higher level. It seemedto me in the circumstances that therewere only two things for the TwentyCommittee to do. Either to come to thconclusion that the position of theiragents was SO dicky that- it was nolonger worth while feeding them withservice information or to continue towatch the situation as had already beendone on two previous occasions afterSnow went to Lisbon and after theexecution of RICHTER, I suggested thatif they adopted the latter course they miCatalogue UeReferenceKM4/oge: some plan whichwould establis n their minds whether351the enemy still had confidence in theorganisation. If they adopted the firstcourse, which I understood that theyhad no desire to do, I thought thatthen there was definitely a matter ofmajor policy which should be discussedby the W.Board. I should contest thecase hotly at the W.Board meeting andif the decision went against me I shouldrecommend that the whole matter should bebrought up to the level of the Chiefs ofStaff.I told J.C. that L would take theCommittee's resalution round to allthe members of the W.Board and obtaintheir views, and having done SO wouldreport to the Tenty Committee at theirnext meeting.A.D.N.I. is getting very worried aboutthe LITTLE case. He does not feelthat he can keep LITTLE under close arrestmuch longer. I explainedto him thatwe had only just got certain of thedocuments and it was going to be diffi-cult to proceed without the presenceof Benson and Jarvis. Certain thingshad been gradually leaking out whichmade me rather sceptical about theoriginal information and unless we hadan opportunity of getting, down to itwith the actual people concerned I didnot think we could find a solution.Ithen spoke to Ferguson and impressedupon him the necessity of getting HarvisCatalogue Reference:KVI4/189S6over at the earliest possible moment.The original telegrams to Miss BellNEWBOLD and Mrs. .STUART have been traced.While their text is obscure I can seeno possible reason for thinking thatthey have anything to do with the"Normandie".The Scharnhorst and Gneisenau andthe Prince bugen, in poor visibility un-der an umbrella of fighters, have leftBrest and proceeded through the Straitsof Dover. I gather that they left duringthe night and took advantage of thefact that Doe aircraft patrolling theBrest had apparently been forced to returnawing to engine trouble and had notreported that it was no's longer on patrol.The result was that we lost 6 hoursbefore any action was taken. we lost16 fighters and 20 bombers, and 6 SwordfisIt is believed that two hits wereobtained. The enemy lost 18 fighters.The whole incident is rather humiliatingand is a bad blow when the fall ofSingapore is imminent and our troops arebeing driven pack in Libya. I am afraidthis is going to make the P.M.S positionextremely difficult and there is agrowing feeling in the House that allthese disasters are due to incompetenceboth in ministerial and service circles.While there may be a good deal in thisview many people feil to realise how muchwe are suffering from the lack of realisa-Catalogue Reference:KVI4/189tion of the by previous359whoCabinets/in spite of persistent earningsfrom the Intelligence Services didnothing.February 14thI did not start the day very well. Iarrived at the office aving had nobreakfast, since my electric lightingheating and cooking had been cut offby the Electricity Company the nightbefore. Owing to a clerical error ontheir part the bill hid been addressedto .Liddell and had been reposing forsome veeks unopened in Cecil's pile ofletters. I have expressed my views onthe position very forcibly to thecompany and I am assured that the wiresvill be reconnected by 12 noon. Injurywas added to insult by a request thatI should pay 5/- for the reconnectingfee. I refused.I had a discussion with ictor,Jack andTheresa Clay about Plan uasi-Dormouse.We are tryingto find a way of givingWalter EGENER a wave-length on which totransmit, and also a code. We came tothe conclusion that Dorothy would probablhave to be the intermediary but it isdifficult to make the scheme plausible.We considered the possibility of gettingthe Germans through B.l nannels toopen up from their side but we agreedthat before doing nything more it wouldbedesirable if possible to find out thepresent position with regard to alter'sCatalogue ReferenCe:KV/4/189300wireless set. Me do not Know whetherhe has yet converted it into a trans-mitter or whether he is attempting touse it. We have had a van working inthe vicinity but he has so far not beenpicked up.Brooman-White,ussens and I had a meetingwith Lakin to discuss the Marshall group.S.O.E. have apparently paid a lumpsum to Marshall who runs a group ofRepublican Spanish thugs operating inFrance. They did not appear to beinterested in the people Marshali employedbut merely in Marsnall's informition.They sometimes used his organisation tocommunicate with France vid New York.Marshall has apparently complained toS.0.E. that we have arrested a number ofhis agents including Onofre GARCIA. Wehad told S.0.E. montns ago that theMarshall group would probably be com-promised but it seems doubtful whetherthey have done anything about thematter. We are now anxious to knowexactly what pay ments have been madeMarshall to GARCIA ind on what dates.This is important as ve are examiningGARCIA'S account ind wish to eliminateall genuine payments. We think itlikely that he has been receiving moneyfrom the Spaniards since he has obviouslybeen giving them information which hehas been obtaining through his contactswith the Free French Forces. Lakin under.took to make enquiries.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/18936 9I had a talk with Victor about the BellNEWBOLD telegrams. STUART is apparentlyone of our own naval officers and MissNEWBOLD his fiancee. I am inclined tothink that the decodes must have beendone in a mental home. They bear noeelation to the original text and wereworked out after the Normandie fire.STUART has been interviewed in Americaand says that the code relates only tohis whereabouts which he was trying toconvey to his relatives in this country,We propose to interview the parties hereand see if they tell the same story.Abbott has just told e.that the futureof Kellar's section is once more in thebalance. After the whole matter had beensettled by the D.G., Horrocks weighed into say that if Kellar was not in E. Divisioit would upset the balance of theorganisation. In the meantime there isendless confusion because Kellar's papersgo to Machell, who is now officiallyB.lK, a title Kellar has been using fora fortnight, and Machell's to KellarAbbott tells me that if Kellar was inB.Division it was proposed to mike himpart of B.IB. I said that while thismight make sense from a registry pointof view it made no sense whatever froman intelligence point of view. If Kellarwas to be part of B. .1B, B.YIG might justas well be lumped in in the same way.Abbott seemed to think that it wouldmake matters easier for the registry, toCatalogue ReferenCe.KVI4/189which I replied that the registry oughtp16?to be serving us and not we the registry.This led to a general discussion onregistry procedure during which Iexpressed my views freely. I said thatthe only test of the efficiency of theRegistry was that a degree of intelli-gence should be applied to the look-up.We never really knew what we were missingIVbut from numerous cases which came tolight, where even N.T.S were given forfiles which had 19 volumes, theposition was not reassuring. i felt quitecertain that only when the girls inthe registry were given certain sets offiles to deal with which referred to thework of certain sections, we should neverget an intelligent look-up. It waswrong to throw the whole intelligenceburden on sections and turn the registryinto a highly mechanised machine.Until we got intelligence running throughthe whole organisation from top tobottom we should never get the bestresults. The look-up is perhaps themost important functio of the officein the detection of a spy. I gatherthat the only argument put forward agastthis system is that all the look upstaff are in a pool which gives flexibil-ity. I cannot see that this is anyargument at all.Brooman-White has had a talk withIGNATIUS. BRUGADA appears to have aadan interesting time in Madrid. He wasentertained rather lavishly by ALCAZARand on the last day was summoned toCatalogue Reference:KVI4/189363ALCAZAR'S house ostensibly to discusspress matters. When he got there hefound a German car outside, and insidethemselves two obvious Gonzalez German officers, and Garcia. calling ALCAZARwas obviously not unacquainted with themboth. The position of Collier wasdiscussed with reference to the dangersof implicating an Englishman, andBRUGADA himself received instructionsfor future work. BRUGADA has brought-over with him in the bag a number ofenvelopes for himself and others contain-ing money and a questionnaire relatingto Army Navy and Air matters. BRUGADAhas secret ink for correspondencethrough the bag and similar facilities aremade use of by BARRA, who is part of theALCAZAR organisation.February 15thIGNATIUS came to the office today andgave us a picture of what was going onin the Spanish Embassy. Everybody isrunning round in circles. Villaverdeis very anxious to avoid a crisis as hethinks that if the Ambassador opensBRUGADA'S bag and finds that it containsinflammatory material he will blow upand get both himself and Villaverderecalled. Villaverde is therefore anxlousif possible to get the F.O. requestwithdrawn. Our only interest lies inthe possibility that the Ambassador mayvent his rage on BRUGADA and send himCatalogaelReference:kd4/1gg is also thought thathe will burn the contents of the envelopesThis would be unfortunate.Dick and I went over to the F.O. tosee Roberts with a view to finding someway out. It was suggested that possiblythe F.O. might modify their requestby saying that they were only interestedto know whether the bag contained anydocuments addressed to CALVO. TheF.O. did not feel that they could goback on what they hadsaid already andthey were reluctant to do so, becausethe accusation that the bag was beingimproperly used was a useful card intheir hands as a set off against theTangier incident which was causing thema lot of trouble in Madrid. WhenBRUGADA arrived he was asked by Villa-verde whether he had ything to tellhim. Villaverde repeated this questionthree times each time with greateremphasis. BRUGADA was evasive. Hesaid that he would RAX be seeing Gannonof F.I.D who was a great personal friendand who might possibly be able to helpabout CALVO. He was going down tothe country to see Villaverde and wasanxious if possible to say that Gannon hadascertained that the F.O. request onlyreferred to correspondence addressedtoCALVO.I said after consultation withF.0. that I did not think he could goas far as this. THere would how ever beno harm in his daying that Gannon who hadnothing to do with the affair thoughtCatalogue on Reference:RV4/18g that as the authorities365had arrested CALVO their request for anexamination of the bag might weli be dueto abelief that it contained letters toCALVO. In fact BRUGADA never saw Gannonat all a:d it was therefore still opento the F.O. if they were pushed into acorner to deny that BRUGADA and Gannonhad ever met. IGHATIUS seems to beworking for appeasement and we areinclined to think that he has keptcertain things back.February l6thWe have had an account from LGNATIUSof what occurred at the Ambassador'shouse last night. Most of the membersof the staff were assembled in theAmbassador's room. The Minister cere-moniously opened the ig and laid all thepackets on a piece of while piper.There were envelopes addressed to BRUGADA,BARRA and others. The Minister thenaddressed the assembly in the followingwords: "Gentlemen, the F 0. havesuggested that our diplomatic bag isbeing improperly used. I shall know howto deal with this matier myself, but formy own satisi.( ction I should like eachof you to open his packet, and if itcontains anything of an espipnage charac-ter I should be gl d if you would hand itto me. I should also like to know ifyour envelopes conti in money." BRUGADAopened his envelopes. One contained E40for Collier and another 1200 odd for G.MCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDin DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION213 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958April oorThe Minister took the moey saying thathe would refer the matter to Madrid indif it was in order the notes would bereturned.

BARIA wis not presentat the intervie and his envelopetherefore remained unopened.I saw Strang this morning and gave himan account of what had happened. TheEmbassy have NOW begun to press for aninterview with CALVO, and the F.O.seem to think that tais will have to begranted sooner or later. I spent theafternoon dictating at home. Dined withU 35 who gave us an account of Vera, whohas gone back to Ayslbury. She has Ithink done her best for us. 35 is sub-mitting a long report. Right at the endof her stay ne discovered that she hJewish blood and that DRUCKER was alsonon-Aryan. This accounts for a greatdeal, particularly the attitude of BRUHNSand other officers, ho refused to eitwith them on their journey to Norway.The whole expedition seems to nave beenextremely hurried and singularly ill-conceived. No details had been wokedout and most parties concerned seemed tothink that the plan was doomed to failure.is very definitely of opinion thatCatalogue alogueReference:KVI4/189RANTLAU was just throwing agents into361this country anyhow in order thit hecould report to his superiors he hadagents in England. This is very muchin confirmation of my theory that thematter was not given serious considera-tion until the Germans reached theChannel ports.February 1/thWe propose in future to take a ratherstrong line with BRUGADA and IGNATIUS.We have got some of BRUGADA'S secretink, which is in the form of a smallpiee of cotton wool dipped in A.V. V.We also have his nib. We propose to getif possible the remainder of his secretink. He will then have to do all hiscorrespondence throu h us. We do notthink that he has told us all he knows,and we intend to exercise pressureunless he comes clean.At the D.G.S meeting vettins was themain subject for discussion. Therehave been a number of cases where throughsome information passed by us to thedepartment concerned a man has beenpermanently blacklisted for any govern-ment employment. In one case theinformation got back to the man himself.The great difficulty about vetting isthat much of the information in our fileshas neve een substantiated one way oranother. If we Nere to attempt to doanything of the kind we should have toCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189have about twenty times the staff andimmobilise all the records. The questiontherefore arises whether unsubstantiatedinformation should be passed on or not.If it happens to be correct and a man gotinto confidential employment we shouldimmediately be accused of having issuedno warning. As things are at presentI am qutite sure that a number of peopleare kept permanently out of Governmentemployment who might be doing usefulwork. The D.G. thought we ought toconfine ourselves solely to securityinterests. The question is what aresecurity interests? If a man is aheavy drinker, a homosexual, a liar orindiscreet, are these traits in hischaracter to be a bar to his employment?Opinions on these matters may oftenvary. It might also be said that aman might be fitted for one kindof employ. -ment but not for another. This againleads to difficulties. Once a manreceives employment of a non-confidentialnature he may at any time be romotedto confidential work vithout any furthernotification to ourselves. It wasdecided that a small committee shouldbe fommed in order to try and find somesolution for theseextremely difficultproblems. There is no doubt that vettinghas done more to get the department a badname than nything else.Brooman-White has seen IGNATIUS and toldhim firmly that we are not satisfiedwith his behaviour. IGNATIUS is penitnet.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/189The Amb ssador is said to be extremelyThis IS A COPYORICINAL DOCUMENI RETAINEDYDEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION 69(4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958yougrateful to the F.O. for their method ofhandling the case of CALVO.obtained last night shows that BARRAhas sent accurate descriptions to Madridand specifications of the performanceof several of our tanks.

TheForces had appe led to the Governnentfor protection but had received none.The result was that a number of officershad become somewhat Fascist-minded.Moret discussed de Gaulle quite freelyHe said that there was a general malaisein the Free French Forces. People feltthat de Gaulle was out for himselfrather than a cause. He regretted theincident of St.Pierre and Miquelon whichhe said could only have added to Winston'sourdens while he was in Washington. Hethought the matter could quite easilyhave been settled at a later date and thatthe attitude adopted by de Gaulle waswrong. He told me about an incident whende Gaulle took over in this country. Hedrafted a telegram to Nogues and Dentzasking t hem to join his organisation.Before sending the telegrams he asked anM.P. called Monet who showed them toRo'ger Cambon for his opinion. Cambonrealised that Dentz and Nogues who wereGenerals of standing would not be likelyto view with favour a telegram of the kinddrafted by de Gaulle who only a few daysbefore had been a Lt.olonel. He there-fore redrafted the telegram in the formCatalogueReference:Kv4/sgince and collaboration.317De Gaulle thanked Monet for obtainingthe observations of Cambon but sent offhis original draft. Moret said tha tthis was typical of the man.Strang tells me that the Ambassador hasinformed the F.0. that there were noletters to CALVO in BRUGADA'S bag, andno communications of the naturesuggested.Villaverde wants himself and BRUGADAto see CALVO. Strang has ascertainedfrom the H.O. that it is in order forsomeone to be present at the interviewithin he ring and to direct the linesof the conversation.Harker talked to me about Jock Whytewho he said was extremely discontented.I said that I had known this for averylong time nd that he had been goinground the office blackguarding myselfand Dick ind telling everybody that heknew more about counter-espionage thananybody else in the office. Harker sasaid that he thought that as Jock hadthe ear of the D.G. and Swinton itmight be wise for me to modify my viewsin some way. I said that Iwas not inthe least concerned by what the D.G. orSwinton thought of Jock Whyte. Theywere entitled to their opinions and Iwas entitled to mine. I could howeverclaim considerable experience of the man'swork over a period of 0 years. Ithought that within his rather narrowCatalogue Reference:kVT4/189373limits and under supervision he could douseful work but that he was swollen-headed and if given any position ofgreater responsibility would as he hasalways one come to false conclusionson insufficient evidence. In fact Lcould never reaily rely on him. I knevihe was a good shovman and knew all thetricks of an eye-washing .0.0. I thoughtthat possibly it might be a wise moveto put him out in a Region and gethis officers properly instructed andsupervised. I did not think he wouldbe ideal in any position but thought hemight perhaps be less harmful in aRegion than he was in his presentposition. I said that he was completelyat sea and that when he came up toone of Vick's meetings made a completefool of himself. This was not altogetherhis fault since in view of the factthat he worked in the country and did nothave access to the ISOS he was naturallysomewhat out of the picture. The actualcifact is that at the moment neither henor any of his section are doing muchwork. This had been the case for manymonths. The present situation is littleshort of a scandal. I had expressed myviews some time ago very forcibly tothe D.G. but they had not been accepted.I did not therefore propose to interferebecause I did not know whether I shouldbe bcked up or not.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/189Cecil tells me that according to a reponseTHISIS A COPYORIGINALDO BETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION31u3 (4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDSACT 1958 prul 200he has had from viv., Gunter SCHUTZhas escaped from internment in Eire.February lothStrang is pressing me for a date on whichCALVO might be seen. L saw the D.M.and Graham about the resolution of theTwenty Committee. D.i.I. agreed with myview that things had not reached a stawhere the .Board could give any usefuldirection. 1 went on to see the D. N. I.and obtained an agreeinent fra him. Iinformed the D..I. about BARRA, thereports about the tanks, and thefact that BARRA Was using secret ink.I told him that Blunt would be makingenquiries with the various M. l.branchesconcerned.I lunched with J.C. and Vincent Maseey.I went on afterwards to a meeting atKinnaird House to discuss the Germanmet.reports which seem to disclose thepresence of two German agents here,one in the Croydon area and one in thaBlackpool area. Gambier-Parry,Maltby,Felix and Frost were present,withSwinton in the chair. There was a gooddeal of technical conversation, at theconclusion of which the D.G. aptly said ththat there appeared to be a 50-50 chanceof these to agents being in this countryCatalogue solutlon Referece:V/4/189: Reference OI the problem. contribute Gambier-Parry to the975said that he could in addition to usingthe R.S.S. machinery employ the servicesof sertain Y.Unites but beyond thishe could not see what he could do exceptto continue with the improvements thatwere being made to the vans. At themoment the vans are totally inadequate.Frost told me before the meeting thatG-P was intending to take the line thatthere were no enemy agents in this countrytransmitting who were not already knownto us. In actual fact he took anentirely contrary vie. He said thathe had always held the view that there werea few highly skilled agents here,probablyoperating under cover of our signalprocedure He was I think rather annoyedthat the whole question had been raised.After the meeting I went to see FindlaterStart. I discussed with him the TwentyCommittee resolution and he entirelyagreed with my views. He also thoughtthat the W.Board had not stuck to itsoriginal charter,namely the directionof policy, and that it had rather degenerated into duplication of the Twenty Committ-ee. He thought that the N.Board hadfailed signally to give directives onlines of major policy. We then went onto discuss our relations with S. I.S. Hefelt very strongly that B. IA and theoffensive side of S. I.S. should get to-gether on the question of their traffic.I heartily agreed. He said that heCatalogue Reference:KVI4/189317bwould like to come to the next meetingof the Twenty Committeee if he couldpossibly manage it..I went along to see Blackford and obtainedhis agreement to the suggested course ofaction regarding the Twenty Committee'sresolution.Cecil has told me about the case inGlasgow where one Tom KENNEDY has beensending messages by a seaman calledO'CONNOR to his brother in Eire aboutconvoys.

The rather controversialissue of XA agents and TA R. relationswith Dansey were under discussion.I began by giving the meeting an accountof the happenings of the last few dayswhich had led to a resolution by theTwenty Committee for dicussion by theW.Board. I explained that in my viewthere was a danger of the W.Boardduplicating the functions of the TwentyCommittee, and that this view had beensupported by the members of the N.Boardall of whom I had seen personally. Noneof them thought that the resolutionshould go forward. I then explained thatwhen a question of co-operation withthe Middle East had been discussed, Ihad formulated a memo which had beenaccted by the W.Board and in which it wasmade quite clear that the control ofXX agents rested with ourselves and S.I.S.It had seemed to me that on previousoccasions the Ds of I. had been goingoutside their sphere when approving thevisit of Celery to Lisbon. On the otherhand I felt very strongly that theexisting machinery which had been set upfor obtaining the chicken-food for agentshad been working extremely well ind thatit was the greatest mistake to do anythingwhich would cause the Intelligencebranches of the Services to lose interest.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/189Within limits therefore I was very anxiousto avoid anything in the nature of amajor issue. Felix was a little inclinedto welcome something of the kind andwas sure that we could go tothe chiefsof Staff for our information which wasperhaps more a matter for the Ops.branchesthan the Intelligence branches. I saidthat while it might be possible to dothis there would be a good deal ofdislocation in the meantime and we mightgo a long way before finding threeService representatives who were readyto take as much trouble as the presentrepresentatives of the Twenty Committee.If we want to get information and get itquickly we have got to stimulate interestand goodwill. I said that I proposed totalk generally to the Twenty Committeeon the whole question and to read to themmy minute to the W.Board which seemedto me to make the position quite clear.We then passed on to the more difficultquestion of T.A.R's relations withDansey. I explained, as I had alreadydone some weeks ago to Viv. and Felix,that if we were both part of the sameoffice T. T.A.R.S A. R.S R. section officers and Danseywould be in daily touch and comparingnotes about the running of their agents.It was quite clear that those who werecontinuously trying to evade awkwardquestions from the enemy would be thefirst to detect similar tendence inagents working abroad. Apart from thisCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS319ACT 1958. Deocthere were many other aspects of runningagents were an exchange of informationmust be of the utmost value. In spiteof this it was true to say that with theexception of one case there had beenno interchange of information whatever.Admittealy this was aue to some extentto the unfortunate relations betweenDansey and Section V. but some way round tthis difficulty ought to be found. It wasentirely wrong that the efficiency ofour two organisations should be jeopardiseowing to personal relations. I thoughttherefore that T.A.R. and his officersshould be allowed access toand others. 1 was fully mindfull ofthe difficulties and of the dangersbut I thought that safeguards could bearranged. Viv. did not seem to have anyreally serious objection to this providedSection V. were kept informed of contactsmade and the reasons for them. Theirdifficulty in the past has been thatwhere such contacts have been made, a goodeal of correspondence has gone onand confusion has resulted. i said thatif Section V. felt that T.A.R.S relationscould not continue I should have totake the matter up with the D.G. forfinal decision. Felix said that hewould welcome such a course.During lunch L had an opportunity for aprivate talk with V.V. about his presentdifficulties. He told me that mattersCatalogae Reerence:KVI4/R8 where cne of hisofficers for whose work he was helaresponsible as deputy to C.S.S. had refusecto have ything to do with him, and thatC.S.S. was inclined to leave matters asthey were. Viv did not feel that he couldaccept this position and has consultedthe D.G. The D.G. said ne could notgive himself the luxury of resigning butrecommended him to put forward a note tohis chief to the effect that if theoffending officer was not to bebrought to heel he, Viv., should berelieved of responsibility for his work.Viv. told the D.G. that ii he thoughtthere was any prospect of his getting anysort of job in our department he wouldresign imnediately as he was thoroughlyfed up with the whole business. The D.G.did not rise to this. I said to Viv.that such a thing might not have beenpossible years ago or even one year ago,but that in the present state of affairs itdid present considerabl difficulties.The only basis on which I could see sucha change wouldbe if he came over here andbrought with him the whole ofSection V.This I thought would in the existingcircumstances be a step in the rightdirection although I had in purelyorganisational lines been opposed to it inthe past. I still thought that organisa-ttionally it would not be right if S. i.S.was united andwellorganised, but L aminclined to think that this is the onlyway out of the difficulty. It certainlypresents many dvantages from the pointof view of duplication of records andpersonnel. There would be snags to getCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18938 1over, such as questions of raccommodationetc.I saw the Home Secretary with Maxwelland John Morris about the case of SamSTEWART. Morris was inclined to takethe view that Snow on his visit toAntwerp had built up Sam STEWART in theeyes of the Germans and that this was whythy had confidence in him. I said thatI did not think that this view was jus-tified by a close study of Snow'straffic.Had the Germans really been relying onSnow they would have replied by leavingthe decision in his hands, on SO importanta matter as the operating of a radio setfrom Belfast. I did didun not think that wewere justified in assuming that they wouldhave lightly thrown Snow, who to them wasan important agent, into the arms ofsomebody about whom they had any seriousdoubts. Morris was allowed to see theactual traffic but was given strictinstructions that on no account was heto communicate this information to thecommittee or to anybody else. Theinterview lasted 14 hours at the end ofwhich the Home Seeretary said he wouldlike to think the matter over. He wouldalso like Morris to consider the case inthe light of the information which hadjust been made available. It was proposedthat a further meeting should be heldon Monday.I addressed the meeting of the TwentyCommittee and told them the view of theCatalogue Reference:KVI4/189members of the W.Board about theirresolution. I also read to them myminute on the constitutional positionof ourselves and S.I.S. vis-a-visthe Twenty Committee and the N.Board.I recommended to them that they Shouldcontinue to watch the situation verycarefully and if possible to devise someplan by which they could obtain theassurance that the enemy still had con-fidence in their organisation. Theyaccepted my views and seemed satisfied.the resolution sending a delegation tothe W.Board will therefore be withdrawn.Ralph Jarvis has come over about thecase of LITTLE. He knows a good dealabout it although he did not deal withit first hand. He admits that there isa strong element of doubt about theoriginal information and thinks thereis not more than a 50/50 chance thatLITTLE is guilty. He is going throughthe papers very carefully with Jim Haleand it is proposed that they shouldinterrogate LITTLE again on Saturday.One of the employees of the BritishLegation who was concerned in the caseis due to arryve shortly and may beable to throw light on the position.February 20thI attended a meeting at the F.O. todiscuss the case of OYENHAUSEN, who wasthe principal Nazi agent in Dar es SalemCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189383He has been interned here for some timeand it is desired to exchange him forBuckley of M.L.W. who was caught inDenmark in the early days of the war.Viv. was present at the meeting and madea strong appeal that Stevens should takethe place ofBuckley. There was a snaghere since the F.O. had already agreed tothe exchange of OYENHAUSEN for buckleyand might be accused of a breach of faithif they tried to introduce Stevensat the last moment. I said that from ahome security point of viewe saw noobjection to YENHAUSEN going backbut that I did feel, particularly at thismoment there might be grave objectinnsfrom a military point of view to releasinga man who had knowledge of Tanganyikaand who clearly before long would beactively working against us. Loxleyundertook to put the various conflictingviews forward.A further meeting was held at the E.0.at which I was present, between Cadogan,the D.G.,Malkin and Strang. from informa.tion that we had received it Was clearthat the Spanish Ambassador was ryingtoget the F.0. to pull his chestnutsout of the fire in the case of CALVO.He had clearly been saockedcto findthat the allegations by the F.O. aboutthe improper use of the bag had beenfully justified, but while he would wel-come a strong line by the FO. he obviousldid not wish to become involved himselfCatalogue Referencukv/4y1ggth Suner. He would35outherefore protest energetically on behalfof CALVO but would not mind very muchif he received a rebuff. The F.O. tookthe view that in this matter they hadto deal with madrid and that the reac-tiond therefox were more important thanthe reactions here. They were thereforeanxious that CALVO should if possiblebe interviewed under sertain safeguardsby a member of the Embassy. We saidthat we would arrange this but we wouldlike to consider whether it would bebetter to get the interview over at onceor to wait another 5 or 6 days. SirWilliam Malkin seemed doubtful aboutthe man's detention under 12(6a) but sincehe had not got a copy of the order inhis archives the other day and hadclearly not read the copy obtained, hisviews did not carry much wuight. It waspointed out to him that the order madeit quite clear that if the carry ing outof the deportation order was in anyway prejudicial to the efficient prose-cution of the war, we had a perfect rightto keep the alien in detention withoutnecessarily preferring any charge.Dick and I lunched with the Czechs.Nothing of any consequence was discussed.Everybody was extremely friendly. Idiscovered that Bartik is a fisherman.I had a discussion in the afternoon aboutCALVO. We thought it would be best toget the interview over and it was subse-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/189385quently arranged that CALVO should beseen at the ratory Schools by VITTURO,the 2nd secretary. We undertook topick him up at the Embassy in a car. Themeeting would be held on the understandingthat only CALVO'S personal condition wouldbe discussed. VITTURO at first thoughtthat the presence of a British Officerrather implied that there was an imputa-tion against his honour. It was explainedto him that this was a mere formalityand had no such significance.February 2lstthe Germans are worried about the Japoccupation of Timor as they are atpresent anxious to preserve Portugueseneutrality. They do not wish howeverto press the Japs too strongly if theoccupation is of strategic importance.the meeting at the Oratory Schools betweenCALVO and VITTURO has gone off quitesuccessfully and the undertaking wasstrictly adhered to.I had a talk with the D.G. about thematter I discussed with Viv on the possib-le amalgamation of Section V. with thisoffice. The D.G. clearly thought thatthere was something in the suggestionand handed me a memo by Herbert on hisexperiences in America which seemed toargue in a similar sense. L mentionedto him T.A.R.S difficulties and theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189liaison with Dansey' Officers. He seemedsympathetic. I also told him that Ithought TAR. should leave for the MiddleEast a S soon as possible. He agreed toour sending a wire to Maunsell.W.C.C. has weighed in on behalf of CuthbertMASON. MASON who XX has a rather badrecord was according to CALVO his confidatand knew about the improper use of thebag by various members of the SpanishEmbassy who were engaged in espionage.We therefore pulled him in under lOB.Crocker now wants to see him in prison.I have said that while this is undesirableit would probably be good policy to allowhim access. I gather that in any case theH.0.: feel that this is inevitable.Kellar's position is still in themeltingpot. Theo says that he does not think hisfunctions come within the sphere of E.Dick has said that only a part of hiswork relates to B. I gather that thereis even now a danger of his going back toF.Cecil has seen the I.G. who says that hehas arrested a Swede called LONDBORGwho is a waiter on the restaurant car ofthe train between Dublin and BelfastHe had quite an elaborate questionnairerelating to disposition of troops etc.in NlIreland. It is difficult to say atthe moment whether he was working directlyfor the the Germans or the I.R.A.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/189387Cecil has compiled a memo for the D.N.I.which tends to show fairly conclusivelythat the German Legation, as such is notactively engaged in espionage ans althoughit may be cognisant of what is going on.He argues that PREETZ was asked to obtainconfirmation about the disposition oftroops in N. Ireland and that this is amatter which could quite easily be carriedout by the Legation. He also givesproof that GOERTZ on his own admissionwas told to keep clear of the Legationunless he found that this could not beavoided. On the other hand it is knownthat the Legation have an illicit wire-less set communicating with Germany.Messages from Germany are of almost dailyoccurrence but the messages to Germanyare only very occasional.February 22ndI saw Lamplough at the Club and asked himwhat the D.N.I.'S object was as far asEire is concerned. He said as far as heknew he only vished to be informed. Hehad heard rumours from various quartersthat the German Legation was very activeand he wished to know the facts, as faras possible.February 23rdI saw T.A.R. this morning, who told methat in conversation with Jarvis thelatter had asked him whether any of hisCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189agents corresponded with addresses inMadrid. He mentioned that one of theirshad written to Apartado 1099. Thisimmediately raised the question in Jar-vis's mind and he there and then rangup Felix to ask if he could communicatewith T.A.R. information about a mancalled Pujol GARCIA. This man had beenregarded by the Assistant Naval Attachein Madrid as a X" agent. It had beenarranged by the Germans that he should besent to England. In fact ne had nevergone further than Lisbon, where he wasremaining in hiding. He had told theGermans that in addition to himself hehad 3 other agents in England and hehad been furnishing them With informationwhich ostensibly came from this country.It seems not unlikely that this accountsfor the very wild messages on the ISOSabout our shipping, which are describedas coming from Felipe's V-Man, in thiscountry. Balloon has been asked toconfirm some of these messages which aregrossly inaccurate. The folly of thisenterprise needs no comment. We arelooking for Felipe's V-Man when hisexistence may be perfectly well known toSection V. Apart from this it isobviously essential tha if anybodyis communicating false nformtionabout affairs in this country we shouldknow exactly what he is saying. We shouldalso know about the Questionnaire.thathe is receiving from the Germans whien Iunderstand is in the possession ofSection V.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1893891D.G. had a talk to me about Kellar butI find it extremely difficult to explainthe position as I see it. I thought itwas generally agreed that Kellar's workin relation to Zionism and Arabs whichhad formerly been carried on in a Russiansetting should now be carried on in aGerman setting since it was the Axis who Wwould be making use of Aral movements andeven possibly a section of the Lionistmovement, such as the Stern group. Theother half of his work will be concernedwith receiving reports on the Middle Eastand collating them with information hereand sending the replies to Maunsell.At the moment this work did not seer tobe very well co-ordinated, and a certainamount of it was not being done at all.The D.G. brushed all this aside, havingpreviously made up his mind that Kellarshould concern himself with Arab MovementsZionism and Egyptian Nationalism. Hewas still of an open mind as to whethersuch work should be carried on in E. or F.He seemed quite convinced that B. werenot concerned except with certain by-produI spoke to Theo who told me he had put upa strong minute saying that his divisionwere dealing with individuals in national.ity sections and not with movements./ Iattended a meeting called by the HomeSecretary at which Maxwell and J.Morriswere present, to discuss the case ofSamuel STEWART. Morris had evidentlybeen trying to think up every possiblepoint for the man's defence. He wasCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189really acting as Counsel for Defence.Hestill stuck to his old arguments andadvanced the following new points:1. Was it possible that in 1940 Snowmade an arrangement with the Germans bywhich they understood that his trafficwas under control, and they receivedinformation which was reliable thoughperhaps not exciting. I said that Ithought that I could probably provethat this was not true since I waspractically certain that the Germans hadshown their confidence in Snow inmatters which had acted seriously totheir detriment. I would however verifythis point. He also thought that as wehad had STEWART under observatior tion fromApril 1940 to the time of his arrest andhad discovered nothing, this might verywell prove his innocence. I said thisdid not follow and that when people talkedabout suspects under observation theywere often not aware of the immensedifficulties involved. It was forexample quite impossible to follow peoplein the black-out. It was even difficu'to follow them in daytime, if they weresuspicious. The Samuel STEWART case wasa particularly difficult one as he hadsuch very good cover for carry ing outhis activities. If he had intended tosend messages to the Germans he had everyopportunity of making use of an employeeon one of his ships. Morris brought upanother point which rather caught meunawares. He said that he had been toldCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18939very onfidentially by Ioby that we hadhad an agent in as secretary for aconsiderable time, but that she had notbeen able to discover that STEWART wasacting as an agent. I said that I wasnot au fait with this side of the case.I did recall thataction of the kind hadbeen sggested but I could not rememberthe details. It suddenly occurred to mehowever that in speaking to Morris Iobymade up the secretary to camouflag themike, and from subsequent enquiries Iam quite sure that this was his intention.Since the mike did not function verywell II shall now have to tell the H.0.that the secretary vas rather deaf andcould not therefore perform her task as wewell as we had hoped. We shall be inserious difficulties if the Committeeask to see her. Personally I think thebest thing to do is to make a clean breastof it to Maxwell and the Home Secretaryand leave John Morris guessing. Morrisraised one point whichwill be ratherdifficult to get over. He said thatSamuel STEWART was accused of hostileassociation but had never been told thename of the individual with whom he wasaccused of being associated. He askedwhether we could put the ame to STEWARTof the member of the German SecretService who had sent the messages. i saidthat this would present us with a cons-siderable difficulty. First of all wedo not know the name of the agent. Weknew the name of the head agent butCatalogue Refereneek/4/18g ther STEWART was knownbavto him or to his subordinates. The onlyalternative would be to put forward thenames of all those representatives of theGerman S.S. who were known to us batthis would not be conclusive, as we didnot know them all. In any Case one wouldexpect STEWART to deny association. Iexplained that we had already given himthe opportunity of mentioning the namesof any Germans or suspicious lienswith whom he had made contact. He hadnot been very helpful in this respect sinche had only mentioned 5 or 4 whereas hemust have been in touch with hundreds.The Home Secretary then asked Morriswhether he thought that release under18A would be satisfactory. Morris took thview that STENART ought either to bereleased entirely or detained. The matterwas left for final decision by the S. ofS. after he had received our answer tothe two points raised by Morris. I haveasked T.A.R. to see Maxwell and explain.the Home Secretary Nas extremelyreasonabland patient in exploring every possibleavenue. He seemed to be by no meanspersuaded -y Morris's arguments, althovthe naturally finds the case an extremelydifficult one.February 24th-March 3rdD.B. On Leave.The telephone's incredulous:"What!

While I wasaway the CALVO case had been giving acertain amount of trouble. From informa-tion subsequently received it transpiredthat at his interview with VITTURO CALVOhad, unobserved by Goodacre, passed anote to VITTURO in which he saidthatthe British authorities had reallynothing on him and that the >paniardsshould watch ARMESTO and PASTOR. Stephenswas extremely upset with this, sinceclearly CALVO should have been searchedbefore he went to the meeting and obser-CatalogueRetefece:kvranagbeen kept to see thatnothing was passed. At subsequent interro-gation CALVO confessed that he had passeda note and told us Nnat wasin it. Todayhe confessed that while in Madrid he wentto a certain address where he wasquestioned by to German officers knownas Pablo and Frederico (both IDOScharacters).. These were the men originallnamed by him as Gonzalez and Garcia.they had asked him to work for them irEngland. He replied that he would do SOprovided they would let me know what wasrequired. They then proceeded to ask himto provide them by means of messages insecret ink with information about troopand convoy movements etc. CALVO demurredbut said that his objections were over-ruled. He then went on to say that hisquestionnaire, secret ink etc. was comingin the diplomatic bag being brought byBRUGADA. He has also given informationto the effect that BARRA is running themilitary organisation and controllingthe activities of Lugo,Castillc andPinedo. BRUGADA and CALVO were to run thecivilian side.e had a meeting with Gubbins aind Dunder-dale on the case of a woman called Victoirwho has come over here with an S.0.E.man called Lucas. Victoire was apparentlyconnected with a Polish cur S.I.S. organ-isation under a man called Waltentywhichhad been rounded up by the Germans.Victoire was made to work for theGermansaccording to her own story and in theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189395course of her business she was put on toLucas who runs the S.O.E. organisationthere which is of considerable dimensions.Lucas who is evidently in love with her,tackled her with this and they concerteda plan by which she should go to Lnglandwith Lucas osteisibly to find out abouthis activities in this country and reportthem to the Germans. Both she and Lucasintend to go back to Occupied France,where they will carry out various coups.They will both then disappear. The wholestory is extremely involved and there areconsiderable difficulties about Victoire'sbona fides. She looks a little likeanother Stella. We have got to try and geher sorted out. Personally I think thatS.0.E. would be extremely ill-advised tolet her go back. Lucas would also be invery great danger unless he decided tochange his identity entirely, and re-establish contact with his organisatiorby the back door.Findlater Stevart came to see the D.G. anddiscussed with him the affairs of theTwenty Committee. He felt very stronglythat there should be a free interch ngeof ideas and traffic beteen ourselves andthe G. Sections of S.I.S. In his capacityas member of the W.Board he proposes toraise this matter after cohsultation withthe Lord President.Jock thyte has put up a long memo ofgrievances against Dick and myself. HeCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18934bis obviously out to make trouble.Strang rang up to say that a wire hadbeen received from wiadrid saying thatthe Spanish uovt. Nere threatenin repris tlfor CALVO. He thought that we ougntto have a discussion about it tomorrow.March 5thI had a meeting with the D.G. and vickabout the reorganisation of SecurityCo-Ordination in so far as it affectedourselves. A good deal of the purelysecurity work is in future to be donethrough the H.D.SE. in order to elieve.I.S. of unnecessary correspondence.Connop Guthrie will carry this NOrkbut still under Stephenson's directionon matters of policy. The D.G. raisedthe question of a Security Servicerepresentative in the United States whowould be in direct touch with the I.B.I.He seemed to feel that Section V. werein unnecessary bottle-neck, and thatthe position as regards America vas entir-Ly different to the position elsewherein such places as Lisbon or Stockholm.He is proposing to raise this matterat the meeting at Kinnaird House. Thereis in my view much to be sid for anarrangement of the kind, but i aminclined to think that a representativof M.I.5 should be part of Stephenson'sorganisation ith direct communicationCatalogue Reference:KVI4/189397with ourselves.I had a meeting with the D.G.,Cecil and.C.Lanes on the question of the I.R.A.the proposal is that there should be aconference of C.C.S interested in I.R.A.matters at which the full implic tionof the GOERTZ case should be explainedto them. At the moment they are I thinka little inclined to be complacent. Theyregard the I.I A. purely as a sabotageorganisation and provided pillar-boxesare not catching fire and so on, they donot feel that they are called upon toinvestigate matters too closely. Theyignore the possibility of the I.R.A.being used as an espionage organisation.The recent case of Tom KENNEDY in Glasgowis a very good illustration of the useto which the I.R.A. may be put. It wasagreed that as a preliminary step Ceciland Hordern should go over and see NormanKendal. This they did in the afternoon.to begin with they met with a somewhacold reception and the attitude ws exact-Ly that described above. In the endhoever Kendal came round to our pointof view and supported the idea of aconference.We had a eting of the Planning Committeewhich dealt almost exclusively with thesituation in Gib. "pparently Medlamand Codrington have been getting togetherand have put forward the suggestionCatalogue that. Refefence:kva4/18ghanc Med the SectionV. work as well as ours. We all agreedthat this Nould not be Satisfactory andthat the original arrangement by whicha special Section V. man should be sentout to uib. should be adhered to.I had a word with Viv. after the meetingwhen warned him that the D.G. mightpossibly raise the question of separaterepresent tion for the Security Servicein america. Viv. did not rule outthe desirability of this course but saidthat he would like to have notice of thequestion.Frost came to see me about the meetingwith R S.S. which as held just beforeI went away on leave. He said that hecould prove that quite a number of thestatements written by Gambier-Parry wereuntrue. The extra assistance hat hewas proposing to get to deal vith theMet. problen would come from D.B.Svarious agents dotted about the country.Frost did not think that they couldcontribute very much. He then went onto speak of a passage that he had hadwith Maltby. R.S.S. apparently pickedup some signa which they were unable toidentify and which was D.F.'d somewherein Cornwall. A van was sent down andand had as was usual sent up its signalsto R.S.S. for identification. They gotno reply out of R.S.S. and telephonedup to know what they were to do. Sclaterquite properly went over to report thematter to R.S.S. and inding only aCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189399Sergeant spoke to him. Maltby then rang ugFrost in a furious temper saying that hewould not have his staff interfered with.He then went on to say that he took strongexception to the way M.I.5 had presentedthe case about the met.reports, and theirbehaviour in a number of other matters.He evidently did not know what he wastalking about and made rather a fool ofhimself. He then came round and apologisedThere is no doubt that the whole positionwith regard to R.S.S. is extremely un-satisfactory. I am having a furtherconference with Frost and Sclater inorder to see what can be done to improvematters.I attended a meeting at Kinnaird Houseon the question of Security o-OrdinationNew York. Felix made some rather offen-sive remarks about hothschild's effortsto get information on the question ofsabotage. Although I dodnot wish to washdirty linen in public I was obligedtosay that Rothschild's sole interest wasto be kept informed of details of anycase of sabotage where this could beattributed to enemy action, or wherethe case was non-proven. Felix wantedthe definite cases to be passed throughS.I.S. and the non-proven cases to gothrough the Security Executive, but thiswas ruled out. He took strong exceptionto Rothschild's writing to I.S. wheneverhe saw cases of sabotage reported in thepapers. I said that hothschild only didCataldgues Reference:k/4/18g that unless heuovstimulated action nothing was being done.There was in fact a lack of cont idenceowing to the paucity of information. Ifwe could be satisfied that we were receiv-ing details of any cases of suspectedenemy sabotage it would not be necessaryfor us to be making the enquiries. Fraserfrom Security Co-Ordination was presentand obviously felt himself in a verydifficult position. He said that he hhad supplied information of all thesecases and he also complained that he re-ceived very little information from thiscountry either about sabotage or aboutthe general set-up of German espion georganisation. The D.G. pointed outthat all information at our disposal wasalso at the dispos al of S.I.S. and sincethey were the channel we rather naturallyexpected that they would keep their ownrepresentatives informed. He complainedthat we got practically no informationabout the various important cases whichhad been run Lng in the United States.It seems fairly clear that the informatonis sent from here to Section V. byourselves and from Security Co-Ordinationto Section V. by New York but that itsticks in the bottle-neck, because Felixis the judge of what concerns New Yorkand London.D.G. spoke to me after the' meeting. Hesaid that he had not thought it advisableto raise the question of separaterepresentation in the atmosphere thatCataloguevReferenee.kv/4risge intended to speak4olpersonally to Swinton and to recommendthat 1 should go to America on a visit.vick and I went over to see Loxley andRoberts about the CALVO case. A telegramhad come from madrid indicating that theSpanish Government was propsaing to takereprisals if CALVO was not sent back toSpain. ALCAZAR apparently said thit ifwe could produce a st atement in writingby CALVO to the effect that he had beenworking for the Germans he would beprepared to drop the case. ALBA h dannounced his intention of visitingCadogan tomorrow morning and if sucha confession could be shown. to hhim thesituation would be greatly eased. TheF.O. proposed to take the line that CALVOwas a non-diplomati Spaniard who hadcome here to spy on behalf of the Germans,that he could not be said that there wasanalogy between his case and that of. anyBritish Consul and that before theyembarked on a policy o1 reprisals they hadbetter consider matters very carefully.It would be explained to the Ambassadorthat in the interests of appeasement theF.0. will endeavour to use their influencein order to dissuade the parties concennedfrom bringing CALVO to trial since ifthis were done there were be some extreme-ly awkward revelations for the SpanishGovt. involving high officials of stte,namely Suner himself. Hf ne is notprosecuted CALVO would be held in detentionuntil after the war under 12(5a) of theCatalogue E-RefeRenEe:KVI4/189uovMarch 6thWe have obtained the necessary confessionfrom CALVO, which is merely a repetitionof statements that he has already madeto the effect that he was working oninstructions from to Germans that he hadmet in Madrid. This has been sentover to the F.O. In the meantime ISOSindicates that the Spaniards arecontemplating the arrest of Ellis,oConsul in Tangier.Fraser came to see me this morning abdunburdened himself about the situationbetween Security Lo-Ordination andSection V. He began by saying that hehad been instructed to bring friendlymessages to me from Stephenson, who wishedme to know that he was extremely sorrythat I had not been able to get out somemonths ago. I explained to Fraser thatI had been quite willing to go but thatas it had been made So plain that I wasnot wanted I had taken no further stepsin order not to aggravte what seemedto be a delicate situation. If it werethought that I could be of use 1 shouldbe only too pleased to go over at anytime. I had not pressedath matter howevesince I did not want people to think thatL was merely trying to find excuses to goout and see my children. He then told methat Stephenson and the other members ofSecurity Coordination were sick to deathof Section V's bottle-neck and that it wasCatalogue Reference:KVI4/189becoming a reatimenace, real since we evidently403did not get the fruits of their laboursand they certainly got nothing from us.I told him that if I had my way at leastSecurity Co-Ordination would be giventhe fullest possible facts about the Germaespionage organisation but that we werenot the channel at the moment for thetransmission of such information andthat thing that we wrote would bebound to contain a good deal of highlyconfidential informtion, the disposa.of which would have to be subject tothe agreement of Section V. I heartilyagreed with Fraser when he said it wasextremely difficult for Security Co-Urdination to get information from theAmericans if they could not make themfeel that they were in our confidenceand kept as fully informed as we couldpossibly manage. I said that I quitesaw that the Americans might from timeto time commit indiscretions but thatit would be fatal to close down on themfor this reason. I told Fraser thatthe D.G. shared his views and thatshould very much like to arrange ameeting between them. Fraser thoughtthis would have to be entirely off therecord, since it had been made quitecle r to him that "cosy talks" withus would not be egarded with favour byS.I.S. I spoke to the D.G. who saidthat he would be very pleasedto seehim.I lunched with Stopford who has justCataloguteureference.kvr4risgc: He paints abad picture. He seems to think thathe has set up a useful organisation but heis appalled by the security problemin W. Africa and by the lack of driveamong colonial office officials. theshipping problem is particularly bad.There are magnificent port facilities,but no equipment, no cranes, no wharves,no roads. Haigh-Wood is obviously nota success. he is regarded as a decentchap but a bore and incapable of carryingthe job. Stopford thinks th t if the workis to be done at all it will have to bedone on a big scale. The local policeforces are fully occupied with pettycriminals. There are no facilitiesfor carrying out observation and thesuggestion of a telephone check isviewed with horror. Haigh-Wooo is justlike a grain of sand in the desert. Thereis no real attempt being made to tacklethe problem. It is certainly a formid-able one and there seems little doubtthat Haigh-Wood is not the man to carryit out even if he gets the neceesaryfacilities. He does not seem to knowhow to begin and has the confidence ofnobody. I spoke to Stopford about thesuggestion of his going to S. Africa. Heseemed to be interested in the job andI am getting him to come along and seethe D.G.Rainbow has been told about unter SCHUTZescape. He has taken the line thatas SCHUTZ is an old school friend of hisCatalogue REFerenee:kvi4ragol diiicult to have104to hand him over to the police, should hetake refuge in Rainbow's house. Afterconsultation with the D.G. it has beendecided to give Rainbow a guaranteethatif he gives information Leading toSCHUTZ'S arrest SCHUTZ will not beexecuted but that he must understand thatif SCHUTZ falls into the hands of thepolice by other means he will have totake his chance. We decided onthis course since there is obviouslynothing to be gained by executing SCHUTZOn the contrary it may be possible toobtain a great deal of useful informationfrom him if he attempts to come to thiscountry which in my view is extremelyunlikely.March 7thI spent the whole morning in answeringJock Whyte's 16 point indictment whichis to a large extent a farrago ofnonesense and symptomatrof the work hehas been doing for many years.We have had trouble with the F.O. aboutthe case of Luis Martinez SUAREZ. Thisman who is a wellknown ISOS characterhas been active in Brussels for someconsiderable time and was recently sentto the Argentine. His boat was pulled inin Trinidad and we had an opportunityof arresting him. Before doing SO Dickconsulted the t.V. and was subsequentlyasked to go over to a meeting at whichCatalogue Reference:KVI4/189yosStrang, Malkin, Loxley and C. were present.Strang said that if SUAREZ were arrestedhe thought that the arrest of Ellis inTangier would enevitably follow, andtherefore strongly advised C. not to agreeto the action we proposed. Dick saidthat he did not take the same view asStrang SUAREZ had as far as we knewno connection with the ALCAZAR Falangeracket. He had been operating inBrussels and was on his way prely asas a German agent to the Argentine. Itseemed unlikely therefore hatthere wouldbe any backwash. His view however wasnot accepted. he then fell back onthe suggestion that SUAREZ should be arres-ted at Curacoa by the Dutch. This cameas a welcome relief to the F.O. althoughto me it seems somewhat ignominious thatwe should hand the baby to our unfortun-ate allies who are just being driven outof the last bit of territory they possess.I spoke to C. and explained to him ourreasons for thinking that there were notlikely to be anyserious repercussions.I also said to him that if Ellis werearrested I thought that we shouldimmediately arrest ARTAZA, the panishonsul in Cardiff. He seemed somewhatworried about starting a consularwar with Spain, since he thought thatwe stood to lose more than the opaniards.At this moment he was pressing theChiefs of Staff to obtain for him morediplomatic cover for directing espionageactivities in Spain and if as a result ofCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189yoour activities the consulates were to beclosed down he would have no means ofusing the Red Cards, if he was able toget them. Red Cards are issued by theSpanish authorities as a kind of diplo-matic quota which cannot be exercisedwithout their permission. At the momenta good many of the cards are held byS.O.E..M.E.W. E. .E.W. etc. I am putting forwardthe whole position to the D.G. since itis now impossible to touch a hair ofany epaniard's head without the fulldress conference ith the F.O. I feitconfident that if the experience ofIBARRONDO and CAMPOS was to be reliedupon, we could get away with it everytime if we dropped the policy of appease-ment and took a strong line.Duck has produced Alba's telegram afterhis interview with the F.0. at which hewas shown CALVOIS confession. alba statesthe positior to Madrid and tells them thathe does not think there is much chanceof CALVO being released. While I wasaway Duck obtained a copy of an interestinmessage from Suner to BARRA asking thelatter to find out what the reaction toa peace move would be in this countryand to report the facts to the new TurkishMinister here for transmissions to theGermans, presumably via ankara. It isdifficult to see why BARRA' should notsend this information back toSuner.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/189Wo7I spoke to the D.G. about Section V. andT.A.R.'S relations with Dansey and CO.Itold him the position which we hadreached at the Planning Committee, andthat it was my view that the liaison in itspresent form should continue. In themeantime Findlater Stuart has writtento Nelson and C. a letter in which hestates his anxiety about the informationthat he has been allowing the Germansto receive through the medium of theTwenty Committee. He wants to know,though his letter is not very clear onthispoint, what grade of informationwe are receiving in return. PersonallyL do not see how we can reduce the levelof our information to that of C's. tokeep our agents in place it is I thinknecessary to strike a rather high meanline. If we give too low a grade ofinformation the Germans will be dissatis-fied and set up some other organisation.If on the other hand our agents are toohighly placed they will sooner or laterget into difficulties since they will beasked very pertinent questions to whichit would not be possible to send atruthful answer. It is possible to runhigh grade XX agents on a short termbasis but not on a long term one, andsince it is our policy to have a reasonabl Lenumber of agents in position and in theconfidence of the enemy at a time ofpossible invasion I think that our policyis the right one.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/189March 8thSpent the day working on my reply toJock Whyte's indictment.March 9thJock Why te came to see me. He talked agreat deal about the case of the lossof documents at the Admiralty establish-ment in Bath. I told him that I had readthe case and that my impression was thatthe state of security at the Admiraltyestablishment at Bath was SO shockingthat almost anything might have happened.On the whole I was more inclined afterreading the police report to think thatthedocuments in question had merely beenmislaid or possibly burned in error.At the same time I thought we ought totake steps to check up on the personnelas far as possible.He also mentioned the case of an Italianwoman Ginette (?)MOCADOSI who was runninga cafe in Glasgow and apparently facili-tating the transit of communicationsto Lisbon. He said he did not know whethe:this case should be run by himself orby Roskill. I thought that if it had anItalian background it should be run byRoskill in close conjunction with .4a.I Should however like to See the file,when I should be in a better position toexpress an opinion. He promised to havecase it sent of up. the Fichtebund I then talked in Eire. about the I toldCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189uouhim that I thought it would be far prefer-able in casesof this sort if instead ofbuilding up a sense of grievance in hisOwn mind over a long period, he came upand saw the officer concerned. I saidthat in the light of all the facts whichhe now had, it was in my view that toplace the names of 200 people in Lire whohad been the recipients of Fichtebundliterature in 1940 on the SecurityList would not really Fthoucht be worthwhile. I wasreinforced in this view by arecent circular asking us to cut downthe Security List, which if allowed togrow too big defeated its own object.Jock Whyte said he still thought somethingought to be done.I had a meeting with Frost and Sclaterwhen we discussed Frosts position vis-a-visR.S.S. Both he and Sclater said quitedefinitely that the attitude of R.SS.was that there was no necessity to payany attention to .1.5. Frost had alreadyhad one or two passages with Maltby andhe proposed to bring the matter to ahead by asking R.S.S. what units theywere employing on general search. I saidthat our right to criticise the organisa-tion of R.S.S. or its work on the techni-cal side had never been admitted eitherby G-P or Maltby. It was not consideredto be our business to question itsefficiency in any way. I thought thereforethat we ought to put up a memo to theD G. and get this question settled onceCatalogue RefErence:KV/4Prg9 is no doubt that thevans are extremely inefficient and thatany criticism of their work is deeplyresented.I had lunch with Crocker in order todiscuss with him the question of his fireexperts, for whom we have SO far claimedexemption. I told him that we were nowbeing pressed pretty hard by the Ministryof Labour and that if he could getexemption for them through the LawSociety it would be a good thing. Hesaid he would look into the matter andsee what could be done.The conversation then turned to the BlackMarket. I told Crocker how we bumped intothe activities of black-marketers fromtime to time and how shocked we were tosee wat was going on. He then disclosedto me in the strictest confidence thatsome time ago he had been sent for byLord Woolton and Lloyd George and Frenchthe Permanent Secretary of the Ministryof Food. They had asked him for hisassistance in unravelling the variousplots. He had promised to work for themon the understanding that no mentioncw wasmade to anyone one of the part he was playing.He was horrified to find that within afew days Lloyd George had spoken aboutthe whole matter at a cocktail partyand that Chief Inspector Ha'therill ofNew Scotland Yard knew all about the parthe was to play. Crocker put Hatheriiloff by saying that he had had some dis-Catalogue Reference.kw4/sgatter but that not hinghad materialised. He had also seen GeorgeJoseph Ball who had given him a wink andwished him luck in his new job. He hadbeen seriously worried by these disclosureas it obviously made his task extremelydifficult. He told me that he had madequite a lot of progress with the meat mar-ket but that he came to a point where hewanted some assistance from Govt. sources.For instance it would help him a greatdeal if it could be arranged that markednotes could be passed which could beidentified when a gang was rounded up.He did not dare go to the police since hehad very strong grounds for thinkingthat Chief Inspector Salisbury was mixedup in the whole business and ne did nottrust Inspector Barker who is employe ed bythe Ministry of rood. He did not throwout any line for co-operation with our-selves but L said I should like very muchto think the whole matter over. I agreedthat I would not speak to the D.G. with-out prior reference to him.I spent the night with Charles who isstill rather seedy but distinctly betterthan he was.March l0thAttended the D.G.S meeting. Vetting wasagain the subject of discussion. Weseem to be passing about 7,000 namesover the records per week and in theopinion of Horroocks much of this workCatalogae RefepenCeKV4/18941zIt is suggested that we should confineourselves to vetting for confidentialposts. The difficulty here is that once aman is in a Ministry we never know whenhe may not get promotion to confidentialwork. I pointed out that another diffi-culty was the lack of security in a goodmany ministries. It was no use takinga lot of trouble about vetting personnel ffor some particular job when one foundthat all their papers were left all overthe place and all and sundrey had accessto the offices. A particular case inpoint was the one at Bath, where alamentable state of affairs had beendisclosed. some documents had been lostand the fact had only been reported some5 weeks later. The state of the officefrom the security point of view waschaotic. Documents were carried awayand burned by a labourer in an incineratora few yards from the main road, andseveral undesirable people had beentaken on in the department without beingvetted at all.Curry was asked at the meeting to speakabout his work. He said that he had alot of informatior to assimilate but thathe was making progress. The D.G. askedhim to make a statement at the meetingnext week. He is going to talk about theAbwehr.Stopford came in in the afternoon to seethe D.G. He gave his views about W. AfricaCatalogue Reference:KV/4/189which he had previous given to me. TheD.G. was very shocked at what he had to saybut not altogether surprised since he hadalready had somewhat similarn informationfrom military sources. I made Stopfordtell the D.G. both about Bourdillon, theGovernor, and the impression created byHaigh-Wood. We discussed the possibilityof Stopford going to S.Africa. He isnot very keen about this appointment uIunless it gives him some scope on theoffensive side. He would really like tobe a joint MI5/MI6 representative butI rather doubt whether this is going tobe possible.Frost tells me that he has got the birdfrom G-P in answer to a query as to whatpersonnel is being employed on thegeneral search for wireless transmissionsapart from ISOS. He has been told thatthis his not his business. I thinkthis will give us a peg on which tohang the whole issue.I had a talk with Kenneth about thetransmission of secret meesages by theFree French through the B.B.C. Apparentlythe Free French are the only allied forcewho are allowed to send these messagesunvetted by S.I.S. I said that beforetaking this matter up on a higher levelI thought we ought to be satisfied thatsomething useful would result. What infact would S.I.S. do if they were inform-ed that a number of messages were beingCatalogue Rerererice:ki4/1agul do nothing useful4tyin fact the Free French organisation wasmore or less under their control. Was ittherefore worth while telling the Frenchvirtually that we did not trust themunless we were going to get somethingout of it. Frost's reply to this is thatall and sundry turn up at the B.B.C. tosend these messages and nobody seems toknow who they are. This I think isdefinitely a point. We should at leastknow that those who are sending thesemesages are properly approved by theappropriate dept. of the Free FrenchForces. G-P is by way of taking respon-sibility for the security of thesemessages but as far as I can ascertainhas done nothing about them.I have asked Cussen to go through myreply to Jock Whyte's memo and to let meknow whether he thinks that it is accurateand fair.March llthI spent the day in bed at Tring witha cold. Dick rang me up about .Africa.The D.G. is apparently anxious to sendWebster, formerly of Port of London. Dickand I both agree that somebody with aknowledge of B.Division work is essen-tial.March 12thI attended a meeting with the D.G. atCatalogue Referece:KM4Pr89The meeting wasuiscalled by Findlater Stewart. Thosepresent were C. C.,Sir Horace Nelson, andArchie Boyle. Findlater said that hehas for some time past been called uponto give a good deal of confidentialinformation for transmission to theGermans in order to keep certain of ouragents in position. He felt considerablresponsibility and wanted to be informedabout the grade of information which WEwere getting from our own agents. Hedid not tthink that in the present circum-stances the Twenty Committee were beingsufficiently well informed. He went onwith to state advantage that in be his far opinion closer there co-operation mightbetween the S. .I.S. people who Nere runningagents and the Twenty Committee. Weobviously both had a good deal to learnfrom each other. C. agreed that thiswas so, and said th in future he pro-posed to put roley on the Committee inaddition to Cowgill. He thought thatFoley would probably be of considerableassistance to us. I said that I felt thatwe also might be of considerable assist-ance to Foley if weknew more aboutthe S I.S. traffic with their agents. C.also agreed to this point. I stressedvery strongly the importance of seeingthat all information transmitted to theenemy from British or ostensibly Britishterritory and all information requestedby the enemy regarding British territoryshould come into the pool of the TwentyCommittee. If this were not done wewere bound to get into difficulties.ICatalogue Reference:KV14/189
