Verais beginningto break. She has mentionedthe Duchesse de Chateau Thierry as aperson with whom she Was to establish con-tact. Our files about the Duchess areinteresting. They show that she wasintroduced to My. ERIKSON, a highly sus-ricious woman who had been employed hereas a domestic servant, to RANTZOW, withthe suggestion that as she was hard-upshe might be approached. The correspon-dence in our files shows that the Duchess'sdaughter was in touch with a Dr. HENRY @HEINRICH, with whom she was negotiatingon behulf of her mother. Her mother wasto provide introductions for Dr. HENRYfriends to Ambassadors. Vera now confirmsthat the Duchess was employed by RANTZOWto set up a salon in this country. Shehad been paid quite a lot of money buthad not produced any very astonishingresults. Vera knows Dr. HENRY as a personwho frequented the Duchess's salon. Itis interesting to note that aboutthis timeattempts were being made to set up asimilar salon in Washington. This allcame outin "Confessions of a Nazi Spy".We are having very close observation bothonthe Duchess and on HENRY. She wasa Dutch Jewess who married a German calledUHLIG who was subsequentlyy divorced andshe then married CHATEAUTHIERRY, who isliving apart from her now.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/187The, following is an appreciation of thesituation on 2.10. 40 by M. I. 14:(a) There are no indications that Germanyhas aandoned the intention of invadingthe U.K. Furthermore, we believe thatGermany will maintain forces on the coastof France and the Low Countries which willact as a constant threat to the securityof the U.K.(b) Germany's immediate plan is to:(i) Instigate Spain to take actionagainst Gibraltar, or disregarding Spaintake such action herself with a view todriving the British Fleet from the Medit-erranean and later taking action in Moroc-CO. Such action might be accompanied bythe occupation of unoccupied France.(ii) Support Italian action againstEgypt with material and troops;(iii) The ultimate objective of theseforces would be the capture of Egypt and 1later of Palestine, thus depriving theBritish Fleet of a base in the EasternMediterranean and ensuring German andItalian oil supplies.(c) In any event Germany will continueair and submarine action against the U.K.Swinton is fussing about not gettingimmediate repprts about every littledetail. The fact is that it is not theslightest good disseminating informationuntil you kno whether it is true or atCatalogue any Reference:kvi4/i8? rate likely, true. We are not63Zall a lot of fools here. All we want isto be left alone to do our job and toproduce a reasoned report as goon as wehave got to the bottom of the case.Swinton is apparently anxious to impressthe P.M. and to get in with the goodsbefore M.I This to my mind is a lament-able attitude. We are none of us interested in kudos. All we want is to get onwith the job. For instance, this after-noon Dick has been swept off to do aninterim report which is quite valuelessas it may very well be misleading. Ithad to be done because Swinton wanted it.The Ghost in Galoshes tells me that hehas had a visit from Fitzgerald, oneof Crockers solicitors. F. was summonedto lunch with C. and brought with himMajor Milner M.P. who is a partner inthe same firm. Both F. and C. werevery loud in their criticism of thisoffice and of Swinton's behaviour. Milnerurged them to produce a full report onthe whole thing which he would submit tothe P.M. This is all rather dirty but Ido not think they will get very far. Isuppose Crocker once more thinks that heis doing the nation a great service.October 4thInterrogations are still going on andDe DEEKER and WALTI absolutely refuse tosay anything except that they cannotunderstand German. Vera has told usCatalogue that DEEKERextremely importantTHIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE UBLICRECORDSACT 1958. yrloocman who could quite easily be exchangedfor some prominent British subject. Sheis evidently very much in love with him,and refuses to disclose his true identityWe are inclined to think he may be WernerULM who is mentioned by all the otherprisoners as one who did a great deal ofinstruction work at the spy school at imi.-lle. It was said that he had already branto England and had been picked up by3German plane in Norfolk, an obviouslyuntrue story.October 5thAnother parachutist has arrived. Hisname is Karl GROSSE, and he had a Britishpassport in the name of Alfred PHILLIPS,which is suspected he obtained in Luxem-bourg. He is a German who returned toGermany from America via Japan after theoutbreak of war. He had a one-way setand maps of Liverpool area. His instruc-tions were to hike about and report onmorale (or as he put it morals), roadblocks, weather conditions .etc. Helanded in Northamton. We had alreadyheard about him from TATE He isgoing to work his set and we propose torun it as a very obvious double-cross inorder to enhance the value of UMMERANDcompany. GROSSE is a poor fish, who neverwanted to be aspy. He joined his regi-ment and when a sergeant asked who spokeEnglish he rather foolishly put up hisCatalogaeefereneekv4/B where he was hewas an indifferent spy dropped down from634the air into Northampton.I saw the V.C.I.G.S. with Roger Hollis.He wanted to know about Communism: Hewas worried about the morale of the troopsduring the winter and the possibility oftheir being affected by agitation. On thewhole his views seemed very sound andsensible. We reassured him, but I pointedout that in our view two things werenecessary, firstly that the Govt. shouldanticipate events rather more intelligently, i.e. it should not allow the C.P. toget the credit for putting people intothe underground or in large shelters inthe East End which had formerly beenlocked up at night; secondly, that ifthe regulations were contravened strongaction should be taken and the reasonexplained to the public. The C.P. hadbeen been allowed to make a lot of capitalout of the case of MASON who would quiteopenly preach ca'canny. If the factshad been given to the workers it isdoubtful whether MASON would have gotany sympathy. It is very necessary toexplain that membership of the C.P.has a a very strong significance whenacts ofthis kind are committed. Thetendency of the H.0. is always to avoidthe issue of .P.membership.October 6thThe Aaquith Committee are now recommen-ding that a complete review of all enemyCatalog view to their release. should be At taken present with a,3557,000 Germans and Austrians are at large.39,000 of these are women. In additionthere are a considerable number of Italians7,000 Germans andAustrians have been de-ported and a few hundred Italians. Thereare at present interned 11,000 Germansand Austrians. I propose that we shouldsay that the tribunal system has alreadyproved itself to be a complete failureand that we see no useful purpose inre-opening all these cases. To avoidcriticism is should be explained to thepublic that internment is a regrettablenecessity and is quite different toimprisonment. Bf such a statement ismade it will be necessary for the Govt.to make proper provision for internees.In our view is is utterly useless to go onputting thesewretched people in and outaccording to the situation at the moment.Vera ERIKSON shows signs of going onhunger strike. She has been remover toHolloway.October 7thTwo French officers and a Czech arrivedyesterday. The Czech has confessed tobeing a German and there are grounds forthinking that he is a spy.Swinton came down today and cross-examinedus about the spy cases. The P.M. hadevidently been asking why we had not shotCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187636some of them. I told Swinton that weunderstood that we had been given a moreor less free hand to promise a man hislife if we thought we were going to getinformation and that information wasreally by far the most important matterto be considered. He said that we had noauthority to grant a man his life andquoted some minute of the Centre. OnOlooking this up we found it was quiteirrelevant. It merely referred to theD.P.P.S attitude in these cases, whichwas that if we wished to prosecute weshould not offera man any inducement totalk. Swinton saidthat in future no-bady was to be offered his life withouthis authority. I am still in ignoranceof what Swinton's position is. I haveseen no charter, and all we know is thathe appears to think that he is head ofM.I.5 and to some extent even of M.I.6.There was a scare the other day about acurious substance looking like spiders webwhich had descended on a policeman whohad subsequently broken out in a rash. Itwas thought that this substance had beendropped by enemy aircraft. Enquiry showedthat thiswas genuine spiders web, whichforms onthe ground at this time of theyear and under certain conditions. Thedew settles on it and when it evaporatessets up convection currents which raisethe webs into the air. These webs takewith them poison hairs from nettles whichcontain formic acid and it was these hairsCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187637which had caused the blistering of theskin that was thought to be due tomustard gas.Communication with Blenheim is frightful.At the moment there are only two linesand one of them is not working. When-ever you ring up you are told that yourname will be put on the waiting list.We have been promised 5 lines but quiclearly we need 20. What seems to havbeen overlooked is that everybody down atBlenheim has to keep in touch with hisoutside contacts, and that if connectionis not made those in the country willbecome completely isolated.October 8thGroup messages show that the Germans aremaking use of wrecks for the installationof wireless sets. It is presumed that theestablish themselves in the funnel. TheAdmiralty are taking stock of the positionof these wrecks and it is intended tointercept one of the most promising.fanything is found there will be areasonable excuse for looking at the re-mainder. There is no doubt that some ofthem are extremely well placed for thepurpose of giving information about ourshipping, and also for directing aninvading party.Up till the 28th Sept., 3,760 enemy aliensCa.tc had been released out of approximateCatalogue Refefencent4r87under the general orderG 38Out of the 3,760, 2,414 have been releasedon groundsof ill-health. 358 for thepurpose of emigration, 302 to joingt theA.M.P.C. and 700 under one of the otherrelease categories. The very large pro-portion of those released on medicalgrounds is causing anxiety even in theH.0. The matter is to be looked into.We have been asked whether we would agreeto the establishment here of 1,000 SpanishRepublicans who are at present at Gib.We are strongly opposed to their cominghere and I believe other arrangements arebeing made.Cockfosters reports indicate that theGermans do not like our wire rockets.These rockets fire a coil of wire into theair, which is held up by parachute.I gather that de Gaulle is not at Doualain the Cameroons and that he will try andkeep control of Libreville. He will thentry to raise and equip a force for opera-tions in the Sudan.G.J.M. LIBOT,Belgian, H.L.L. L. JONASSON, Swedeand one de LILLE, also a Belgian, arrivedat Plymouth in a cutter called "La PartBien".

He was alsoinstructed to send a message on theGander transmitter purporting to operatefrom somewhere near Northampton. Themessage was to consist of weather reports,a report as to road blocks, and the generamorale of the public. Read and Ganderwill compose the message and have itapproved by T.A.R. or Stephens.

He now admits tohaving arrived by seaplane and states thatit is true that he had to come to Londonto hand over his W/T set at a rendez-vouS at Victoria Station. B. 6. and 8.B.were instructed to cover this meeting.T.A.R. reports that from the interrogationof Vera it emerged that she was probablyan unconscious agent of RANTZAU. Shewas passed on to RANTZAU by Fritz GALLUSof Johnaalle 63, Hamburg and latterly ofthe Seamannshaus, Hamburg. GALLUS alsoroped in a certain Gretel MULLER.Albert de JAEGER (Hatchet) is now atLatchmere and Jiri GRAF has bea moved tothe Aban Court Hotel, Harrington Gardens.At our meeting today it was decided torope in the Duchesse, her daughter andMr. and Mrs. HENRY on Saturday.G.W. has received a letter from a manon the paper of the Tuscan Hotel. Thewriter says that he met ay friend of afriend of Mr. KETTERING in Madrid and woulvery much like to see G.W. at the earl-atalogueskeferfencelrviarisrt. "KETTERING" was a6ulpre-arranged pass-word between Snow andRANTZOW and company. It was changed about2-3 weeks ago to "KETROCH". G. G.W. willsee the writer but not before we havechecked up on his bona fides. Theinterrogation of Vera indicates thatshe was formerly a 4th Dept. agentworking under Serge IGNATIEFF, whosemistress she was.There was a meeting of the AliensAdvisory Committee yesterday to discusscertain recommendations of the AsquithCommittee including the one by whichlarge numbers of enemy aliens would bere-drafted into industry. Newsam was astrongsupporter of M. M.I.5.Morrisson has now taken over as HomeSecretary.There was a meeting of the Home DefendeExecutive to discuss the question ofspeeding up of vetting of candidates forthe A.M.P.C. Swinton had previouslyexpressed great annoyance at what hedescribed as the slowness in vetting.Dick had organised a very good committeeunder DEMUTH which was carrying out thiswork very conscientiously. The Forceswere consulted and said that they muchpreferred to have the people vetted pro-perly and could well afford to wait.Not content with this, Swirton insistedon Dick getting hold of DEMUTH andbringing him to the Centre.DEMUTH stoodCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187642his ground very well. He said that hecould not possible acceptresponsibilityunless he was allowed to do the thing inhis own way. He could vet 200 and possib-ly more per week. Swintonseemed satisfiedwith this but wrote a letter later imply-ing that DEMUTH had guaranteed 300 a weekand was now only proposing to do somethingover 200. This was not in fact the case.No mention had ever been made of 300.The question was finally discussed by theCentre, when all the Services said theywere in no hurry and wished to place them-selves entirely in the hands of M.I.5.Harry said that in conversationwwith thevarious A.G. S branches he was satisfiedthat they preferred to have people pro-perly vetted and not rushed into theA.M.P.C. without previous knowledge oftheir anteedents.Arrangements have been made by which allI. I.S.S.B. rumours are to be sentto us.October lOthWe had a conference about the Germanagents who formerly frequented the salonof the Duchesse. It was decided thatwe should act on Monday.I had a long talk with Canning and explain-ed to him the general lay-out. I also hada talk with Foster and Gill. Canning wasquite outspoken about Crocker and theCatalogue-peefererce:kviartsptc. He said that64?there were manypeople coming up in thebranch who could not get out of theirheads that at the conclusion of the war,when he (Canning) and others of high rankretired, Burt and his minions would be putin to take their places. Canning said hehad donehhis best to dispel this ideabut without success. He said also thatthere was a general feeling in the Branchthat we had not been satisfied with thwork his officers had been doing and there-fore wished to set up our own detectiveforce. I told him exactly how the wholething had happened and that we were in nosense responsible. I also made it quiteclear that we were thoroughly satisfiedwith the work S.B. were doing. As regardsBurt, told Canning that he had been thefirst to come to me after Crocker's depar-ture and to explain what he felt were hislimitations. He quite realised that therewa a great deal of work here which hecould not possibly tackle as he did notknow enought about the background. I infformed Canning that Burt was now employedvery largely on cases of sabotage whichwere more in the strictly C.I.D. sphere:and that in that capacity he was doingvery useful work. It was not intendedthat he should in any way impinge on S.B.preserves. It was quite clear to me thatBurt's appointment in SO far as S.B. areconcerned was as we always thought andsaid a gross blunder, the effect of whichwill take some time to die down. It isquite clear that S.B. resent the fact thatBurt and his minions make use of S.B.filesCataloguetreferensekVfltoir work.644We rather hoped that we had discovered theidentity of De DEEKER. S.I.S. hadpapers about H. L. ABBAS who seemed to havebeen closely associated with RANTZOW andwhose description seemed to fit. ABBAShas an uncle in London called Hector ABBASand we have decided to have him inter-viewed.G.W. has met his Spaniard. He was givenE3,500 in a tin of talcum powder. He isto report on factories in the west of Eng-land and on the Welsh Nationalist Movementand is also to work up something in thesabotage line. In the meantime he hasbeen asked to obtain an intermediary betweehimself and the Spaniard whose name is DelPOZO, henceforth known as POGO. G.W. isvery incensed at having the money takenaway from him and threatens to resign.Marriot managed to calm him down. Heis rather an umpleasant type who isobviously on the make. Enquiry about POGOshows that he came here under the auspicesof the British Council and on the recom-mendation of Sam Hoare. The BritishCouncil are trying to arrange for himto visit the forces and to show him asmuch as possible. They seem to think thisis a good plan, as the falange to whichPOGOquite openly belongs gets all its newsfrom Germany. On arrival here POGO hadtold the I.0. that he did not want Spainto enter the war but he hoped Germanywould win. It seems a curious thing thatour authorities should not be really wiseCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187to the fact that any member of a falange,which is in fact a Spanish Nazi Party,must be right in the German camp. TheAir Ministry had been somewhat cautiousand had arranged a tour of certain aero-dromes in the north of Scotland. TheArmy on the other hand, without referenceto us had arranged for POGO to visit 7thXorps H.Q. Q. and other units. The NavyI think had turned him down. A numberof names and addresses were found on POGOwhen he came in. One of these being aSpaniard,ESCOBAR He is a member of afalange and of the Spanish Club. His add-reSs had aso appeared in the papers ofone Enrique BUENA, a Spaniard, who hadbeen arrested by the police for takingparticulars of air raid damage. Thepolice, thinking he was a nitwit, hadreleased him. An interesting pointabout P.0.G.O. is that he has expresseda keen desire to the British Council to beallowed to take part in an air raid onBerlin. This opens up allsorts ofpossibilities. My suggestion is that whenwe have got as much out of him throughG.W. as possible, we should accede tohis request.

At the conclusion I said it was essen-tial that notone word of it should go anyfurther at the present stage. He entirelyagreed. I then asked him exactly what hewanted us to report to him in future, as Ihad rather got the impression from our previainterview that he had no confidence eitherin myself or in Dick in SO far as the handlingof this case was concerned.

The occupationof Rumania by Germany will cut Bulgaria offfrom direct communication with Russia by land.The offer of access to the Mediterranean byBulgaria, whether at Salonika or further East,combined with German pressure, will either causBulgaria to allow the Germans a free passagethrough the war her on the country, Axis side. or will The bring fulfilment them into ofBulgarian access to the Mediterranean wouldsever Greece from land communications withTurkey, enable the Germans from Bulgaria, andthe Italians from Albania, to overrun Greecewithout much difficulty, or even to occupy thecountry without opposition. This would com-plete the isolation of Yugoslavi and placeall the Balkan States in the hands of theAxis. Germany would then be in a position,either alone or with Bulgarian assistance, todeal with Turkey. In the meantime she willhave continued the construction of the necess-ary aerodromes in Bulgaria on which it isunderstood work has alre dy begun. At thisstage (probably from the middle of November on)we may expect an intensified diplomatic andpolitical pressure on Turkey, backed by threatsof military and air action. We should expectthat in present circumstances Russia wouldCatalogue Reference:KV14/187657connive at this pressure. The aim of thiswould be to ensure the safe passage ofsupplies through the Straits from the BlackSea. If Turkey yielded to this pressure, thefirst stage of the Axis plan could be regardedas complete, and the political and militarydomination of Turkey would follow.A clear indication may them be expected as towhether the Axis propose to continue theirdrive on the lines indicated above. If SuCula policy as been decided upon, we shouldexpect military preparations such as work onroads and railways, the collection of militarystores and the preparation of aerodromes inWestern Asia Minor.If the Turkish Govt. resist Axis pressureandoffer armed resistance to the axis attack theywould be expected to put up a stout resistanceon their first and second lines in Thrace, butthe probability of air-borne attack by theGermans, as well as attacks by armoured divi-sions, dive bombers and 5th column activitiesis likely to make the holding of the Turkishdefences not only in Thrace but also thoseof the Straits, precarious. Their low SCaof air armament will increase the disadvanuaof the Turks and without considerable rein-forcements in the air from ourselves, itcannot be expected that their resistancewould be prolonged. If the Turks are com-pelled to retire across the Bosphorus, theyare likely to destroy rolling stock in Thraceahd in the absence of a train ferry, itshould take the Germans some time, even whenCatalogue Reference:KVI4/187they succeed in crossing the Straits, to6s8transport to Asiatic Turkey sufficient rollingstock and M.T. for a further adv once.Whether Turkey resists or not the Germansshould be able to occupy European Turkeyand establish bridge-heads at Constantinopleand Chanak by the end of the year or earlyin 1941. Similarly, if the Germans decideto push on, they may be expected, whetherTurkey resists or not, to pass the TaurusMts. as soon as the whather permits,i.e inApril.It has been suggested that any German advancefrom Rumania, instead of being directed towarsthe Straits, would be aimed at securing directcontrol of the Caucasian oil fields. Thiswould involve hostilities against Russia,which are consideed unlikely.The J.I.C. recommend that everything possibleshould be done to strengthen Turkey' will andability to resist Axis pressure. Failingsome British success (particularly againstthe Italian forces in Lybia), the most effec-tive means by which her will to resist could bbe strengthened would be the knowledge thatRussia would not connive at German agression.It is urgent to reassure Turkey on this point,and it is of aramount importance to preventRussia from definitely aligning hersdf againstus in the Near East and Middle East. Immedia-te action in this matter is therefore requiredIn order to reinforce Turkish ability toresist it is essential to give effectivemilitary and air support both by the despatchcataldgueReference:ri4mespecially a.a. andb5aanti-tank guns, and by a definite promiseof air support in the shape of Britishsquadrons should they be attacked.As a practical step it is essential to ensurethat adequate preparations are made for thedestruction of the tunnels through theTaurus Mts.The J.I.C. a also recommend (a) the pro-vision as soon as possible, but in any casenot later than by the spring of 1941, adequateforces for despatch to Southern Iraq with thedual purpose of afeguarding, and if necess-ary occupying the Abadan oil fields, andof over-aweing Irag. Such forces shouldhave full-scale air defence unitf, includingfighters. (b) that adequate plans should bemade for the destruction of the Iragi oil welsand pipe lines, if necessary, and for executinthese plans in ample time. It is essentialthat these plans should be kept absolutelysecret from the Iraqi Govt., from whom noco-operation of any kind in this matter canbe expected. (c) that every possible effortshould be made, pending such time as troopcan be despatched to Southern Irag, toinduee the Iraq Govt. to adopt a more friendlyattitude. To have any real chance ofsuccess, this would probably involve financialhelp and the despatch of some defensive arma-ments. In addition, the possibility shouldbe explored of increasing our propagan andadopting methods such as the bribery of indi-vidual Iraquis which have not yet been employ-ed.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/18766Although rather outside their charter, as afinal recommendation it is submitted thatevery possible effort should be made toreduce, as rapidly as possible, German Airstrength in order to prevent her directingair forces to the South East. Germany willrely in the future as in the past, largelyon air power to obtain a quick decision. Anyserious interference with Germany's airstrength will not only restrict her militaryand political successes, but may also encour-age Russia to oppose Axis aspirations, par-ticularly when connected with the Balkans andMiddle East.I lunched today with Carrigan.

A complete parachute with harnessoveralls and flying helmet was found neatlyfolded and placed in a hedge beside abridle path on Hill Far, Haversham,Bucks.The parachute was wet but the clothinginside dry, and it appears that it may havebeen dropped during the past two or threedays. Inside the parachute was a paperwrapping for chocolate made in Belgium,and a packet containing a white tablet,probably concentr ted food. The packethad recently been opened and contents consumed. The parachute had without doubt beeused, and the parachutist landed uninjuredand is still at large.

His wife is caretaker and heprobably lives there as well. We are con-sidering putting a check on him.The following interesting fact has emergedin connection with Tate's transmitter. Be-fore he was provided with the one he isatpresent using he was given one which wasa much larger instrument, which he said wasused by parachutists in Holland and BelgiumThey told him that he would be given aspecial combination in order to open theback of the transmitter to put it intooperation, and that if this combinationwas not used (that is to say, if it wasopened by someone unaware of the combina-tion), the instrument would be blown upby a small bomb which was to be placedinside.November 5thThe possibility is being discussed ofSNOW demanding a meeting with the otherside and Northern Ireland is suggested asa suitable venue. It is agreed that SNOWshould take the line that he was dissatis-fied with the evidences of German incompet-ence and inefficiency and that, unless hiscomplaints could be cleared up satisfac-torily at an interview, he was contempla-ting throwing in his hand altogether.Novemper 6thyCharles and Horrocks came up to London andCatalogue we had Reference.KVI4/187 about the office.I saw Stewart Menzies and asked, if therewere to be changes, there was any chanceof V.V taking over here. He told me thatV.V. was not very well favoured inmilitary circles, but that he would cer-tainly reecomend him although he could illbe spared.I lunched with Farrer.November 7thPOGO has badly blotted his copy -book bygetting tight and giving an indiscreetinterview to the Daily Express. He toldthe Express that he hoped Germany wouldwin. We have st wer a violent protestto the other side who have repliedapologetically. It seems that POGO hasbeen superimposed on their system by someoutside body, probably the Propaganda.Ministry.I examined the holorith machine in W.today. It is being used for censor-ship analysis.

POGO israther upset by the M. of I. broadcast toItaly which attributed to him the view thatalthough the Italian Air Force may be good,the Italian infantry is hopeless. POGOrealises that he did in fact say this putonly when he was slightly drunk.

They would also be given othercommodities such as tea, tobacco etc.RICKETT, FREEMAN and de LAZOVERT were toarrange this if they could get the necess-ary backing. BAUDELOT had evidently beenused to get RICKETT and company in touchwith the P.M. 's entourage through theDuke of Westminster. Westminster's soleinterest seems to be the woman.RICKETT told us a lot about himself and hismany financial deals. He said that hehad had a lot of experience in dealingwith Orientals and that he always workedthrough women.

It wassuggested to FULLER that possibly certainpassages in his articles might be harmfuto this country and cause alarm anddespondency abroad. FULLER asked what theoffending passages were and when these wereshown to him he said that he could see noharm in them. He refused point blank toalter any of his articles.

The party hadbeen organised by a Dutch skipper and theyhad made their escape from Brittany. Theywere on their way to Ireland and had putinto Fishguard for medical attention forone of the Cubans. They were interrogatedby Bingham, and the skipper after 23 hoursconfessed that they were sent over by theGermans. They had E150 on them.I saw D.M.I. and Penney, when they gave metheir views about this office. They seemto have in mind some amalgamation of M. M.I.5and M.I.6 under the I.C.I.G.S. They hadconsidered Lennox as possible head of M.I.5I said that while I thought Lennox wasexcellent in his present job I could notsee him as head of M.I.5 I thought V.Iwas much better suited to the job if achange was to be made. Penney thoughtV.V was inclined to quarrel with his staffand did not make a good impression. Isaidthat they were both entirely wrong, andthat what M.I.5 needed was somebody whoactually understood the workings of theoffice today. The alternative was someman of standing who would either chargeround like a bull in a china shop and messthe whole place up in a fortnight or sitback for 4 months and absorbe everythingthat was told him. A man of this typeCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18779would not be of much use to us in theimmediate future. While we wanted a manof standing to fight our battles outsidewe equally wanted someone who would beof immediate assistance to us in the work Wewe were doing.We had one of the worst bombing raids inLondon since the beginning of the war.I think I heard at least 40 bombs comedown and one or two made the flat rock.They were I think somewhere at the backof Lowndes Sg. or Chesham Place.

Thedamage was considerable.November 1ZtbhThe Navy has captured the "Freese" offJan Mayen Island, and two German Intelligen-ce Directors, HANSEN and FINCKENSTEIN @ FINCare now in captivity. They are to be takento Ham.November l3thWe had a meeting of the W. Committee todiscussthe possibility of putting someconstructive proposals about making use ofour XX system. There are three mainobjectives (1) to keep our agents sufficient-ly well fed with accurate information SOas not to lose the confidenee of the enemy(2) to control as many of the enemy'agents in this country as we can in order-Catalogue make efetrhercefRet4/t87 the ground is650covered and they need not send any moreof whose arrival we might not be awareand (3) by careful manoeuvring of theseagents and a careful study of the ques-tionnaires, to mislead the enemy on a bigscale and at the appropriate moment.For this purpose we want a small committeeon which the services are represented,and also Home Security, to work out plansin advance. It was agreed that we shouldbe given the necessary personnel. It isquite obvious that most of the drivingforce will have to come from below. TheD'S of I. are quite prepared to take theresponsibility for giving information, butit is unlikely that either they or theChiefs of Staff will formulate any long-term plan. When we have made a plan weshall have to try ind get it approved andthen work to it.I heard today that Jane had been sackedfor insubordination. This is a veryserious blow to us all. There is no doubtthat she was completely on the wrong legbut somehow I f el that the incident shouldnot have happened. I am trying to thinkwhether there is anything to be done.November 20thI went down to Blenheim and saw Jane at theBear Inn. She seemed to be quite normalbut in a fighting modd. She was determinedto put forward her views in high quarters.I asked her to do nothing for the momentCatalogHerRetereocekv4pb8zibl to smooth out6916the difficulties. I felt that if Petriewas coming over to look into our affairsshe might perhaps be given a chance oftalking to him.November 2lstThe M.I.6. agent reports that POGO hasrecently written to his chief in Spainstating that hissstay in this country hasconvinced him that Gt.Britain is invicible.Had a long discussion with D.S.S. andCharles. I told D.S.S. that I thoughtthat Jane had no technical right of appealbut that in view of her long and devotedservice she certainly had a moral right.Both he and Charles took the view thatshe had no right at all, and that if theDirector's authority was questioned in thismatter he had no alternative but to re-sign. They neither of them thought thatthere was any possibility of her returningto this office even though she tenderedan apology.November 22ndD.N.I. called today with members of hisstaff and was given an insight into theXX agent sy stem. We thought that thiswould be a good thing as it might helpto get their cooperation.November 24thCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187G&1November 24thTheo told me that D. S.S. had suggestedthe transfer of B.8. to C. S. I said thatthis was practically a fait accompli andthat organisationally I thought it wouldbe quite sound.The general situation at the moment seems tobe slightly better and I have a feeling thatwe have turned the corner. The Greekshave been doing very well and our NavalAir Arm have dealt a hammer blow at theItalian Fleet at Taranto. Our air forceare doing very well and can certainly holdthe enemy by daylight. The black spotsare the night bombing of important indus-trial areas and the heavy damage to ourshipping, both by submarines and vibrationmines.November 25thI had to go down to Blenheim in orderto explain to R.O.'s that Jane was nolonger incharge, and had in fact left theoffice. I said that nobody regretted thismore than I did but I had done everythingpossible to smooth things over, but thatan impasse had been reached. I was sorrythat I could not say any more except thatI hoped everybody would continue workingas before. I had a ongydiscussion withCurry about the whole business and alsowith MacIver who is carrying on for theCataloguReterence:kVi4ne a talk with Charles.66He is very depressed and does not feelthat he can stick it much longer.November 26thLennox rang me up in a great state of mind.He wanted to see me some time before 5 pmas he had received instructions to go toDowning Street at 5 o'clock. I ratherwondered whether he was going to be askea totake over the office. I thought it bestto get this clear and told him that in myview neither he m I were suitable, andif anybody was to come in V.V. was far thebest choice. He entirely agreed with me.When he got to Downing St. he found thatLord Croft, presumably on theadvice ofthe D.M.I. had written to the P.M. sayingthat all was not well with M. I.5 and hehad better have a talk with Lennox.Lennox told the P.M. what he thoughtabout this office andalso about the Centre.The P.M. then replied that he did notknow why Lennox had come, to which theanswer was "Because you sent for me".The P.M. said that he always leftthese matters in the hands of Major Mortonand he would be glad if Lennox wouldhave a talk with him at once. The P.M.seemed worried about the Boothby case,which he thought had been badly represen-ted by M.I.5 and he took the opportunityto make a long political speech whilewalking round the Cabinet room. Lennoxwent straight on to Morton who was moreHe told Lennox that PetrieCatalogue Reference.KVI4/187GSYwas on his way here to enquire into thewhole organisation.November 27thCharles saw Swinton and gave him his viewsabout the office. He suggested that Swin-ton should have a talk with me, but thisdid not go very well. He said "You see,Guy thinks I'm a bloody shit". Charlesprotested vehemently but without makingmuch headway. He mentioned Frost andtold Swinton that he thought him a snake inthe grass, neither loyal to M.I.5. nor toSwinton himself. Swinton seemed worriedabout this.November 28thI received a note from Lennox telling meof an interview beteen himself, Frost and GGrogan. It was quite clear that Frosthad very big ideas about himself. A re-organisation scheme was going on directedby Horrocks, a good many people would haveto go, I should be left as Adviser butFrost would take over as general co-ordin-ator of B. and W. Horrocks spoke toSwinton about the organisa ition as a wholeand threw a copy of Lennox's letter onthe table. He told Swinton that if hewere head of the office he would send forFrost and Grogan and dismiss them both.This was in fact what I had recommendedD.S.S. to do. Swinton appeared to haveCatalogue received Reference:KV/4/187 a real beteen the eyes, but6%'he shortly recovered and seemed to thinkthat somehow or other Frost's abilityought to be harnessed into the machine.Horrocks then said that he had no opinionof Frost's ability at all and regarded himas a wind-bag.November 29thD.S.S. saw Swinton and handed him afuller note on Lennox's interview withFrost. Swinton's last words were thatitwas quite clear that Frost could notremain in M.I.5.November 30thHam was bombed last night in one of theworst night raids we have had in London.There was a direct hit on the main build-ing, and 3 casualties, among the guard.BRUJHNS, one of the internees, had a seriousskull injury and is not expected to live.There have been three interesting develop-ments today. Firstly, Group 2 has beenbroken. These messages are between theprincipal st ations in Western Europe andBerlin and should give us a great deal ofvaluable information. Secondly, GIRAFFEour Czech agent, has received a draft fromthe Swiss Banking Corporation for 650.It comes from the Banca Santo Spirito eCommerciale in Lisbon. What seems to havehappened is that the White Russian directorULPE of the London Merchnts Bank whereCatalogue Reference:Kvi4/187y told to apply hasG8etipped off the Swiss Banking Cororation.The payment is from the account ofPALLHARES. Thirdly, there is the discoveryof a S. African who has been in hospitalfor 17 weeks and says he is suffering fromloss of memory after a motor-accident.We think that this man is probably aGerman agent, a S. .African, who we wereexpecting and that he probably damagedhimself slightly when coming down. Hisloss of memory is merely a cover and he ismaking extremely intelligent use of it.He tells all sorts of stories and if theydo not check up he throns the blame onhis memory.December lstWeekend with Charles.December 2ndThe case of POGO is getting ratherdifficult. The M. of I. have told him thathe is no good and he had better go home.Meanwhile the Spanish Embassy seem to havecome to the same conclusion. We cannotstop him without endangering the positionof our agent and without causing an inci-dent with the Spanish Govt. which the F.O.are very anxious toavoid. We are going totry and get the British Council to smooththings over and then place POGO in thehands of Cavendish-Bentinck n order thathe can be fed with interesting F.0. news.C-B will take the line that a great mistakeCataloguebrererence:Kv4/i87t he has been deputed6'7to put it right.We got up Masterman today to help us withthe planning of the XX work. He hasIbelieve a very good brain and I very muchhope that he will put forward some usefulsuggestions.December 3rdI saw Desmond Morton today and had along talk with him about the whole office.He told me that changes were pending butthat no decision had yet been made.He himself had seen the 3 D's of I. andthey were all agreed that the head ofM.I.5 should be a civilian of standing.They had in mind the Master of the Rolls.I told Morton that though such an appoint-ment might be very good, We did wantsomebody to assist us in the actual workand that I could think of no one betterthan V.V. Morton did not think that V.V.was suitable to run the whole office, buthe did consider that possibly he wouldmake a valuable assistant. He wouldbear this in mind. I begged him notto believe the many wild stories which weregoing about. 90% of our troubles werein the Directorate and the fact that theregistry was not working. This had beenattributed to a variety of reasons, forwhich M.I.5 were not responsible Inspite of all these difficulties a greatdeal of very useful work was being doneand with a few minor adjustments couldCataloguietRefefende:KV4/i8ings right.668A letter has been received from Swintonwhich clearly shows that he is beginningto hedge about Frost.T saw Hopkinson today and asked him toslow up the departure of POGO. He saidhe was doing everything he possiblycould to smooth down the Embassy. Therewas no immediate prospect of POGO goingbecause he could not get a se it on theplane.Victorand I lunched with Winsch of theSwiss Banking Corporation. We hadpreviously had him vetted by Swiss Green whothought that he was thoroughly pro-Britishin his outlook. Winsch, who is a Swiss,has had a great deal of banking experiencein Spain and Portugal nand had expresseda wish to Victor to do something for thiscountry. After a great deal of discussionWinsch said that if his direetors couldbe squared, he would be quite ready togo to Lisbon for us. Alternatively Ithink he could be of great assistance nce tous here. We did not reach a point whereI could definitely ask him about people'saccounts in the Swiss Banking Corporationbut I think that with care we might getto this point. He is certainly in aposition to know quite a lot.December 4thSwinton has seen Frost in the presenceCatalogueReference.KV/4/i87 bea toldof Harker and given Frost a thorough to make681his apologies to me. This is obviouslymost unsatisfactory and I am really rathermy wit's end. My feeling is that Ishould resign if Frost is not removedbut everybody else seems to think thatthis would be a mistake, although I thinkthey would give me their full support.Personally I do not think that anybodyoutside the office would care very muchif T did resign. E feel a very definiteloss of self-respect but I have decidedto leave things as they are and to see Swinton Friday.December 5thFrost came to see me and made his apology.Ilistened to him in glum silence, and thentold him that there was no room here forpeople who were place-hunting or lookingfor kudos. There was.only room for thosewho wanted to do a job of work. There hadbeen far too much running round intriguingand gossiping. His reply was more or lessthat I expected. He had been misunderstoedand Lennox had misnepresented him. Hethought that Lennox had committed a breachof confidence by repeating a conversationwhich was a purely private one. I saidthat I had known Lennox for a long timeand he would not break a confidence unlesshe felt there were over-riding reasons fordoing SO. He had evidently felt that therewere such reasons. I then told Frost thatit would be no longer possible for T.A.R.to remain in W. and that I was proposing toCalalegue Rieferencekvi4nsmnisation1g were indeed it should over always to670have been. The SNOW case had only goneto W. because T.A.R. was thoroughly au faitwith all its details. Frost obviouslydid not like this and wished to put upcertain suggestions with regard to thefuture liaison. I told him that he shoulddo SO and that I would consider them.December 6thI saw Swinton today. I said that firstof all T should like to try and put some-thing right. I had been told that hethought I was moved by certain personalfeelings against him and that I wasin consequence obstructive. I wished tosay that this was entirely untrue. D wasonly interested in doing mywork as efficien.tly as possible and that I was very gratefulto him for all he had done to put overoulpoint of view with other departments..He seemed to accept this. I then went onto speak about Frost. I said that I did notsee how there could be any peace in thisoffice while he remained. the wasobviously an intriguer first and foremostand was SO regarded by everyone here.This was no isolated incident. T.A.R. hadtold me months ago andtI had pressed himto remain where he was. What I felt wasthat this was for the general interest.I now felt that this could not continueand that T.A.R. and the XXybusiness mustcome back where they belonged. Swintondid not demur but he was anxious thatCatalsgaetReference.kvi4rrszit; he evidently had acertain regard, should not be isolatedon account af what had happened. Hethought that after his talk with himthe latter would not misbehave himselfagain. We then discussed the reorganisa-tion. He was full of Horrocks' achieve-ments as a re-organiser of the Treasuryetc. I told him that while I had the verybest personal relations with lorrocks, Esometimes wondered whether he fullyunderstood what he was trying to re-organ-ise in our office. I had already spokenabout the registry and the impossibilityof getting anything looked up either nowor in the near future, and I had also studiethe re-organisation plan. Swinton pulledout a copy of this, which I was under theimpression that he had not yet seen, asit was still the sub ject of discussionamongst ourselves. I pointed out thatthe main purpose of it was to create anactive espionage section to which allcases of any importance should be thrownup. T did not think that this was a-practical arrangement, and I gave theexample of a case of Russian espionage.I explained that various forms of inforInetion would be coming in and that referencewould be made to people and incidents whichwould only be known to someone who wasmaking a very close study of the Communistmovement in this country and abroad. It wastherefore imperative that any such caseshould be run by the Communiyst section andnot by the active espionage section.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1876Swinton seemed to see the force of thisargument. Lastly I spoke to him aboutJLane. Swinton told me that he did notthink that it was perhaps proper for himto discuss this matter. She had submitteda memorandum with a request that she shouldbe given an interview. He had consultedwith the Lord President who thought thatshe had no technical right but had a moralright. Swinton was proposing to see herin front of Harker and Butler. I saidthat ifthe thought it improper that Ishould speak, I would say no more. He thvuthought a little, and then asked me formy views, which I gave him, though Isaid they would only be of a general kind.I said that she had always been in arather privelged position as a courtjester, but that onthis occasion shehad undoubtedly overstepped the mark andcommitted an act of gross insubordination.She was therefore completely on the wrongleg. Secondly, and on this point Ispeke with some feeling, the office hadlost the services of an extremely valuableofficer. She h d served for 24 years andI regarded her as far more efficient thanmost of the men. It was therefore littleshort of a disaster that her servicescould no longer be utilised. ThirdlyI wanted to say that discipline withinthe branch had become a very difficultmatter owing to lack of confidence inthe management and a feeling of frustra-tion caused by the various difficultieswhich for one reason or another wereCatalogue Reference:KVI4/18769preventing officers from carrying outtheir duties in a manner satisfactoryto themselves. There was no inducementfor anybody to stay here unless they feltthat they were doing a job of work forthe country. It was therefore essentialthat when orders were issued affectingtheir work they should be consulted andtheir views considered. There was at themoment very little machinery for suchconsultation and differences had arisenin consequence. I thought these couldeasily be smoothed out if appropriateaction were taken.December BthDick has just produced another magnumopus based on the Group messages and whatwe have learned from the captured agents.We are now beginning to get quite a goodpicture of the German espionage organisa-tion.December 9thThe expedition to take Pantelleria is and tteed up. It is to be part of a largeconvoy which is going right round theCape. The Pantelleria expedition willbreak away off Gib. Boddington and W.have been carrying out general reconnais-sance on the Clyde to see how much isknown of this expedition. While theyhave discovered most things, nobody seemsto be very clear about the destination.Catalogue This Reference: ReferenCE.KVI4/187 is probablysasmuch much as can be hoped.694December l0thWe had a conference today on reorganisa-tion, when Horrocks presented his famousplan. It developed into a sort of dog-fight between Harker, Horrocks and Abbotton one side, Curry,Di and myself on theother, and Charles rather silent andneutral.Horrock's plan divides the office up into3 blocks. One is called "Active Espion-age", another "Aliens" and the third"Subversive Movements". Under the aliensblock there are sections concerned withthe "detection of espionage". I pointedout that it would be fundamentally wrongto divide responsibility for espionage andthe detection of it, and that if a caseof espionage arose in the subversive sectiait should be dealt with there, since itcould obviously have background ofeither Fascism or Communism. Horrocksargument was that a gre t deal of thematerial that came into this officeabout aliens was of little consequenceand purely for record purposes, and thatit would therefore be better if a case arosein any of these sections, to give it toan expert espionage section which wouldhave the best knowledge to deal with it.I said that in many ways it was far moredifficult to spot some case in embryothan it was to deal with anYobvious ca eonce it had been detected, and that youtherefore needed.your best brains toCatalegye extract Referenc the material had some which vague was of95complaint about not knowing where to sendpapers. He instanced B.7, which was divi-ded up into about 8 sub-groups. I saidthat obviously people's functions had tobe divided up and that it was merely aquestion of getting the papers to the peoplewho were dealing with any particular line.If the registry could not compete withthis work it would be necessary to have asemior secretary in each section who Wondistribute the papers to those concerned.Abbott thought that a Russian case whicharose in the Communist section should begiven to the active espionage group whichwould be better qualified to handle it.Curry replied acidly that anybody whohad ever andled a case of espionage couldnot possibly make such a suggestion. Themeeting broke up without any conclusionsbeing reached. Before it closed I saidthat I thought that our first considerationshould be the registry and that before westarted to pull about a rather delicateorganisation like .Branch we should makesure that the Card Index was on its feetand that papers were readily obtainable.Horrocks said that the work of the registrywould be greatly facilitated if blockswere formed according to his plan.Personally I was unable to see the forceof this argument.I met the two Americans at Yaterloo today.They are Mr. Clegg and Mr. Clarence Hince,previously reported as Florence Hince.atalogueefetenee:ki4isto see a glamour plati-696num blonde and were much disappointed.We told him SO and he seemed to think itwas a good joke.We have been asked to dig out more Italiansfrom the internment camp. They are Iunderstand to go on the Pantelleriaexpedition. Exactly what they are going todo I cannot imagine. I was told that theidea had some political significance.Presumably the authorities think that itwould create a f avourable impression ifit were said that Pantelleria had beentaken by the waiters of London.The attack on Libya ia developing veryrapidly, and prisoners and equipment arecoming in fast.December llthSwinton came down and we discussed intern-ment and Irish refugees. I said that ifthere were an invasion in the spring andanything in the nature of general internmentwas thought necessary, we should go throughall the difficulties that were experiencedin July. As far as I knew there was no veryadequate provisin even for the 1,000 or15,000 people who would be arrested immedia-tely the invasion started. Lord Swintondid not think that the Government had beencontemplating anything in the nature of ageneral internment again. X said that Ithought that this was rather difficult toforesee and that they might find themselvesCataogue Referertce.kvapsequest of the military6a7authorities.He said he would raise thequestion. We then discussed the Irishrefugees who would flood this country inthe event ofan invasion of Ireland. Thepresent arrangement was that all thoselanding should be apprehended by the HomeGuard and handed over to the police, andthen put in cages. I rather wonderedwhat these cages were like. Do theyconsist of a barbed wire fence in themiddle of a field? If so, there wouldobviously be an outery, because many ofthose coming over would be perfectlyloyal British citizens. If there were noproper accommodation there would obviouslybe no opportunity for us to examine them.I also wondered whether anybody had con-sidered what was to become of those whowere released from the cages. Obvicuslythey would have to be looked after and hous-ed. Dwinten said he would also take upthis matter on the Executive.I lunched with Clegg and Hince and had along talk with Clegg. They have an enor-mouse programme which covers everythingfrom S.I.S. to the Fire Brigade. Theywere desperately anxious to wipe out theimpression left by the Turrou incident.Clegg told me that he now covers the wholeof the western hemisphere both for espion-age and counter-espionage. He looks astough as a gangster but is I think a verygood fellowCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187698December 12thT.A.R. has moved over from W. today withhis various minions.I spent the night with V.V. when we dis-cussed the Horrocks plan. V.V. is in entireagreement with me on all the main principleDecember 13thWe have taken 20,000 prisoners in Libya.Beaumont-Nesbitt, D.M.I.,has D.M.I. I. has been sackedand is to be replaced by Davidson. I amsorry about Beaumont-Nesbitt who has alwaysbeen very helpful to us. I think he wasconsidered to be too weak. For somereason V.C.I.G.S. did not like him.I knew Davidson when he was in M.I. andliked him. We used to co-operate on thearms traffic.Dick and I drew up a counter re-organisatioplan over a very good bottle of Richbourg.My idea is to have an Alien Control sectionwhich would be an extension of Theo Turner'group. This would take off us a great manyproblems of a more or less administrativekind.December 14thHad lunch with Archie Boyle He had readthe whole of Dick's memo and was veryimpressed by it. He mentioned a new kindalogueereferereekkv/ri8 is carried up on theA9end of a wire to a considerable height.It all sounded rather Heath Robinsonianto me.Lennox tells me that Pantelleria is nowoff as there is considerable talk of aGerman invasion of Spain and Portugal.In such an eventuality I gather that thereis some idea of taking Ceuta.December 15thEde has returned from Malta. He spent 3weeks in Gib. waiting for a ship and thenwent half way across the Atlantic. Hesays that things in Malta are not at all baand considering the number of air raidsthat they have had the damage is slight.Gib.I gather looks like a real fortress andis bristling with guns.Spent the night with Charles.December l6thWent over to Blenhein today and sawCurry and Horrocks. I thought it mightbe a good thing to make it clear toHorrocks that John Maude's memo compiledby him and the controlling officers on thepresent state of the registry was in nosense a personal attack. I felt that asI had opposed Horrocks's reorganisationscheme he might think that I was trying togive him a stab in the back about theregistry. He was obviously rather soreCatalogue talaguetreference!2V4/18te said that B. l. were700satisfied and that nothing had been saidabout this. We then discussed the reor-ganisation in the hope that we might findsome common basis. I left him a copy ofmy plan and also a copy of a memo whichCurry had drawn up. He did not seem veryinterested in either, although his attitudewas perfectly friendly. I think he appre-ciated my going over to see him.December 17thWe had the famous meeting on reorganisationwith Swinton in the chair. He began byenunciating certain principles of a veryelementa kind. Most important was perhasthat you should fit your personalitiesto the organisation and not your organisa-tion to your personalities. I said thatwhile I was in agreement with this it hadto be borne in mind (a) that the organisa-tion was bound to be somewhat fluid and(b) that changes would have to be gradual.I also said that we had for some time beenworking towards what we thought was a mostsuitable gtouping. We then went on todiscuss the aliens block. I repeated thearguments of our previous meeting and saidthat in prireiple I thought the arrangementof the 3 blocks was fundamentally unsound.Both Curry and Dick agreed with me and gavetheir reasons. In conclusion I said thatif the purpose of the reorganisation schemewas to relieve pressure or those at presentin catrol of .Branch, this would be betterachieved through the development of theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18710tsystem of controlling officers and sub-controlling officers which was at presentin existence, and through a group ofsections on the lines indicated in a planwhich I had prepared, Espionage, SuoversiveActivities, and General Purposes blocks,being closely controlled by one head underthe Director. I recommended the formationof a new block known as the Aliens Controlblock, which would be directly respon-sible to D.S.S. This block would performthe duties specified under "internment andrelease" in the Horrocks plan and wouldin effect constitute a development of theduties performed by the Civil Securitysection under Turner. In this way theIntelligence Branches would be relievedof a number of duties which were not direct-ly connected with their work of investiga-tion. Swinton paid little attention to ourremarks and was evidently set on the Horrocksplan subject to certain amendments.e.g heagreed that the sabotage and commericalespionagesections should be in the activeespi nage group and that the, question ofB.R. should remain in abeyance. Horrockshad put it in the subversive group and hadsubsequently suggested that they should beunder the Administration branch. I saidthat I did not see how an organisation whichwas mainly an outpost of .Branch couldpossibly come under Administration. Finallywe discussed the question of control of the3 blocks. I said that it wus essential thatthey should be closely controlled by oneperson, since whatever the grouping theyCataloguedReferenee:KVHa/repsely inter-related.702Swinton seemed to agree on this point.It was in fact about the only one on whichhe was in agreement.KIFBOM, the 3rd spy, was executed today.We have been notified from the other sidethat the parachutist we have been waitingfor for SO long at Manchester has beendropped. So far he has not reported.Mrs. O'GRADY has been sentenced to death.Personally I doubt whether she is guiltyof any thing more than collecting informationShe probably pictured herself as a masterspy, and cannot bring herself to say thatthere was really nothing behind it all.The question of dealing with Communistshas been raised. Swinton wanted to know ourviews. I said that we were not anxiousfor the party to be proscribed, but thatwe thought that strong aaction wasdesirable when any communist transgressedthe law. We also thought that communistsShould not be alloned to make capital outof cases like the MASON case. MASON wasjust spirited away under Lob but theGovernment's case had never been explainedto the public. Communists were makinggreat play with the whole matter.December l8thI saw Hopkinson, Makins and Cavendish-Bentinck at the F.O. today about POGO.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/187703They are going to try and smooth thingsout with the Spanish Embassy and theMinistry of Information. O'Brien of theBritish meeting between Council POGO is to and try Makins. and arr arrange ange If this agoes well Cavendish-Bentinck will beintroduced and will use POGO as a mediumfor putting over diplomatic information.I saw Generl Piggott today aboutCrocker's men. He is going to try andget them released.John is desperately anxious to be allowedto go into the registry and help in impro-ving the morale. I am putting this forwardbut do not think I shall have much success.December 19thI lunched today with Neville Bland. Hewanted to know whether we had anythingabout aman called G. R. STRAUSS who writesin the New Statesman nd Nation. He madesome very insulting remarks about Bland'sbroadcast on 5th column activities inHolland, and I gather that libel proceed-ings are contemplated.Studied Horrocks's plan today in very greatdetail. If the sections are to be arrangedin accordance with his grouping they willall be split up in the most impossible way.He had Irish liaison in the aliens block,and German activities in Ireland in theespionage block. Czech liaison was in theCataloguereferenee:4riset suspects in theespionage NLOCK.704I had a talk with V.V. today about Petrie.V.V. V. V. is going to see him and put him wiseto our difficulties.A prosecution is being staged against Mrs.NICHOLSON. She is the wife of AdmiralWNilmot NICHOLSON. They are both mixed upin the Right Club and were connected withAnna WOLKOFF and Tyler KENT. The Admiralis rather a passive member and stronglyanti-semitic and with a bee in his bonneton the subjectof corruption in high Govern-ment circles. Mrs. NICHOLSON on the otherhand h is a much more active member of theRight Club and has a strong pro-Germanbackground. In May 1940 we heard that sheand her husband claimed to have obtainedfrom Anna WOLKOFF the full story of ourNorwegian Expeditionary Force. Later inMay we were told that Mrs. NICHOLSON hadmade a copy of some document which AnnaWOLKOFF had obtained from Tyler KENT.Almost simultaneously we heard that aservant employed by the NICHOLSONS washanded a sealed envelope by Mrs. N. withOinstructions that she was to take it homeand hide it and that if she was questionedshe was to say that it was Admiral NICHOLTSON'S will. The servant handed the envel-ope to the police who found that it con-tained two sheets of notepaper withpencilled writing very much abbreviated.It was clearly a copy of one of the U.S.Embassy telegrams. The handwriting appear-ed identical with that of a Right Clubcard found in Maule RAMSEY property, andCatalogee Refepemee:K/4/187 the writing ofMrs.N. She was arrested on 26th May andadmitted that the document was hers, thatwhen-she knew Anna WOLKOFF and had metTy ler KENT. She refused at first to say whohad given her the document of which she hadmade a copy, but later admitted that itwas Anna. She was detained and subse-quently interned under lob. The contentsof the telegram dealt among other matterswith the now famous .S.destroyer deal.At that time the matter was considered SOsecret that the prosecution of Mrs. N.was out of the question. Now the officersof the Crown consider that she should bedealt with under the Official Secrets Actand Defence Regulations.December 20thHad a long discussion with Charles aboutthe reorganisationmeeting. I told him thatI was very worried about the whole thing.He thinks that I should put in a minorityreport.December 21stDid my Xmas shopping this morning.December 22ndDick has got interesting news about STORK.December 24th -25thAt Hailey Manor.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/187706December 26thNot feeling very well. This has gone roundthe office, who think I have got a hang-over. Quite untrue of course.December 27thAt Blenheim this morning and had discussionwith Curry about the reorganisation.Went on to Tring where we spent a cheerfulevening. Dick is very interested in aMrs. MARSTON who has come over from Lisbonwhere she had been seen in company withan agent of WIMMER & Co. WIMMER has astrong German background. Mrs. M. is stayinat Oatlands Park, it is alleged with aPortugueseDick also told me about the MUSELIERcase. A letter had been produced byHoward, alleged to have been written byGen. ROZOY of the Vichy Consulate, toLISBOA, 2nd Secretary of the BrazilianEmbassy, and carried by Mlle. d 'ANJOU, hismistress. The letter disclosed that MUSEL-IER had warned Vichy about the Dakar pro-ject.December 28thWent to see Desmond Morton today about theMUSELIER case. I showed him the letter andexplained to him very carefully that whilewe had verified the text as fir as possibleCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187707also the paper, the signature and the stamp,there were two weak links in the chainbetween the source and ourselves, namelythe Adjutant COLLIN, who had not got a verygood reputation, and a nythical man calledGOMEZ who was supposed to be an attacheat the Brazilian Embassy. Morton got veryexcited about the letter, which he said hethought had all the appearance of beinggenuine and said that he would like toshow it to the P.M. at once. I made itquite clear to him that we should not havebrought it to his notice at all if we had nnot heard through a junior member ofHoward's office that the contents of theletter had already been communicated ver-bally to Col. Angenot, de Gaulle's Chief ofStaff. It followed therefore that itwould be all over de Gaulle's headquarterswithin the next 24 hours. I said that ifhe was going to show it to the P.M. I hopedhe would make it absolutely clear that wecould give no guarantee whatever about thesource of the information. Otherwise Iforesaw that it might recoil on our headsand M.I.5. would be held responsible forproducing a mare's next. Morton said thehe had heard criticisms in the past thatM.I.5. were too inclined to hold things uppending verification and that we had doneabsolutely right in bringing it to hisnotice immediately. He thought that theF.0. should be informed. Kenneth Youngerand I then went round to see Hopkinson andtold him the same story.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/187708December 29thI completed my reply to Swinton, forwardingcorrections to the minutes of the reorgan-isation meeting which had been held underhis chairmanship. I made it quite clear thaI fundamentally disagreed with the Horrocksplan.We had a meeting today to discuss measuresfor dealing with fishermen. Group messsagesseem to indicate that use is being made offishermen to report on convoys. There isnothing much to stop a meeting between aBritish fishing boat and a French one fromBrest which may be working off the Irishcoast.December 30thHad a discussion with Frost and Groganabout W. There seems to be a case forW. investigating censorship cases in avery limited way. To things are howeveressential (a) that they should ascertainwhether any other section is alreadyinterested and (b) that as soon as itbecomes clearly defined it should go tothe section in B. which is normally con-cerned.December 3lstCurry came up and had a talk with W. Heis going to try and work out some charter.He is also going into the holorith.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/187169January lst 1941.Petrie has arrived. I have had a shorttalk with him about the organisation. Itold him that it would be difficult for meto discuss B.Branch without going intopersonalities. He said that he thought itwould be better to deal with the organisa-tion first and that perhaps we might dis-cusS personalities later. He did nottell me SO, but I gather that he has refusedto take over the office until he has had alook at it. For the time being he willconfine himself to a report on the organ-isation.We have now obtained 3 more letters fromCOLLIN who says that he has obtained themfrom the same source. They deal with avariety of matters and all incriminateMUSELIER. His Chief of Staff, a Lt. VILLERSalso seems to be involved. We can findnothing wrong with the text of the documentsKenneth is giving them to Desmond Mortonunder the same safeguards.At about 10 p.m. I was rung up at Tringby Harker. He said that the P.M. had givenorders for the arrest of MUSELIER, VILLERSand Mlle.d'ANJOU. I offered to come upbut he said he did not think this wasnecessary. He and Kenneth went to seeMorton, when Kenneth once more emphasisedour doubts about the sourcey of the informa-tion. Morton said that the P.M. had givenhis order and there was nothing to be doneCatalgtetReference.tVf4ri87 Col. Angenot was710fetched and attempts were made to get holdof Gen. de Gaulle. He was away on leaveand it was found impossible to get intotouch with him. Angenot rather regretfullyagreed to the action suggested. Althoughhe thought that the documents bore the stampof genuineness he would have liked Gen. deGaulle to have seen them before the arrestswere made.The Home Secretary was visited by Harkerand Morton and gave the necessary orders tothe police. Luckily we had already warnedCanning during the afternoon that someaction might be taken. In deference toAngenot's wishes no action was taken againstMoret, Muselier's Chief of Staff, but athis equest Mlle. HERINCX was put on thelist as it was thought that if there wasany conspiracy by Muselier she would be themost likely person to have documents.The police took action during the course ofthe night. le.d'ANJOU was found in bedwith LISBOA and Mlle. HERINCX with a Dr. deKERGUELEN. This is the first occasion onwhich they had slept together and it was hisbirthday. The police saw fit to bring inthe doctor on the grounds of his associationwith Mlle. HERINCX. LISBOA, hearing thepolice entering lle.d'ANJOU's flat, thoughtthat they had some about the blackout andhid in the lavatory. He eventually emergedand claimed diplomatic privileges. Whilehe could not object to the flat beingsearched he refused to allow the police totouch any of his own clothes.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1871VILLERS could not be arrested till 8 a. m.as he was on night duty at the Free Frenchheadquarters, and it was found that theAdmiral was down at Windsor spending thenight with a lady friend. He eventuallyrolled up about 9 a.m. By way of precautiorthe police pulled in his valet and chauf-feur. The Admiral protested mildly. Hesaid he hoped the matter would soon becleared up as it would create a very badimpression in the Free French Navy.January 2ndI interrogated Mlle.dANJOU, but could getno change. She protested that she hadnever carried any letter from anybodyconnected with the Vichy Consulate or theFree French Forces to LISBOA. When Ishowed her the letter in which hernamewas mentioned she seemed genuinely unableto interpret it.January 3rdI went down to Praewood this morning todiscuss with V.V. what we should say toClegg and Hince about the group messages.It was agreed that we should try andfindout how much they knew before disclosingour hand. We had common ground to begin onsince they already had information aboutGroup 10.I saw de Gaulle at the F.O. at 4 p. m.Heseemed very sore about the arrest of theCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18777beAdmiral. He/gan by saying that in hisopinion the documents had been forged eitherby the British Intelligence, by his ownSecurity Bureau or by the Vichy Consulate.He then put forward a number of points,none of which either Cadogan or I thoughtwere in any way conclusive. They were infact all very weak points. He ey ed me withthe gravest suspicion and at one momenthinted that the documents might have beenforged by Kenneth, who was the only personwho had seen the originals. I assured him tthat this was not so, and that he could rulethe possibility out of his mind. I counterehis points to some extent but owing to theobviously very tense situation I thought itwas better not to criticise his judgmenttoo strongly. He gave me the impressionof being a very conceited man. At theconclusion of the meeting he asked whatwe were going to do. I said that we po-posed to continue the enquiry. He saidwhat was the use of continuing the enquiryif the documents were forgeries. We saidthat we thought it desirable that the caseshould be cleared up to the satisfaction ofall concerned. He said that he proposedto see Sir Dudley Pound, tell him that hehad interviewed COLLIN and that he wassatisfied that the documents were forgeries,and ask for the Admiral's immediate release.Cadogan said he had a perfect right to dothis if he wished.yIn the evening I went through the Muselierpapers at the Yard. There was nothing inCatalogue Referehceekvitalsequence. Among hisiproperty was an opium smoking outfit.January 4thI saw COLLIN and his friend STIEGLHEMBERat Howard's flat. They had again to givean account of their doings the night before,when it was alleged that they had both beento the Brazilian Embassy and seen GOMEZ,whom they now stated to be BARBOZA, oneof the Attaches. STIEGLHEMBER told methat he had waited on the ground floor whileCOLLIN had gone into BARBOZA'S room. Iasked him to give a description of BARBOZAwhich seemed to embarrass him rather. Ithen tackled COLLIN. He said that whileSTIEGLHEMBER had remained on the groundfloor he had gone up to the 4th floor wherehe had seen BARBOZA. I then had STIEGLHEM-BER and COLLIN in together. I said that oneor other of them was obviously lying, andI wanted to know the truth. STIEGLHEMBERthen confessed that in actual fact he hadremained outside the Embassy and that hehad lied to me because he had lied toHoward the night before and had to beconsistent. He had lied to Howard becausehe wanted to support his friend COLLIN ina story which he believed to be true.This all seemed very unsatisfactory, andI went away with serious misgivings aboutthe whole business. Admiral Dickens of theSpears Mission visited Muselier on Fridayand thought that the prison conditions atPentonville were very severe. It wasatalogueReference.kya4/1s7at theAdmiral should714be removed to Brixton. He was visited theretoday by Gen. de Gaulle's A. A.D.C. C. CommanderCollet, and Kenneth. The A.D.C. told theAdmiral that all would be well as the Generalwas quite convinced that his arrest wasdue to "un coup monte par les gens de Vichya Londres" The Admiral seemed in fairlygood spirits.January 5thKenneth and I spent a long time getting outa report on the Muselier case up to date.The conclusions were that no evidence hadbeen discovered among the papers of thosearrested in support of the documents, thatnothing had been discovered which wouldseriously challenge the text of the documentbut that their origin was still in doubt.January ZthGeorge has returned from Lisbon with E80O,a high-class transmitting set concealed ina gramophone and secret ink in a speciallymade cigarette holder. He has a long stor.January 8thCOLLIN was pulled in last night and has con-fessed that he forged the documents in theMuselier case. He says that he was inspiredby Howard, with an idea of re-instating him-self and giving the French Security Servicea boost. He told us that when the firstdocument was produced, dated September 5th,Catalogue Reference:KV/4/187115Howard had looked at it and then told himthat it was no good as the things recordeddid not fit in with the date. A few hourslater he returned with an identical documentdated August 5th. On this we decided topull in Howard, whorconfessed that thetwo documents had been presented to him andthat ne had accepted the second one asbeing genuine and completely forgotten toinform us of the facts. I find it rathedifficult to believe that either COLLIN or HHoward would have had sufficient backgroundto forge the text of the documents, and itis still possible that somebody else may bebehind COLLIN. I find it difficult tobelieve that Howard is really a bad man. Hehad been reporting about Muselier and hisentourage for some time and the whole businehas become rather an obsession with him.I am inclined to think that when he saw thedocument, even though the date had beenchanged, he just could not or would notbelieve that it was not genuine.Kenneth had a curious scene with InspectorCain d S.B. who certainly behaves in a Vvery odd way. He suddenly gets wild theoriesabout a case, but in the end seems to getat the facts with fair efficiency. He gotit into his head that Kenneth was with-holding some important information. In factat one moment he thought Kenneth might haveforged the documents. He started grillinghim as if he were a pickpocket. Kennethgot ather annoyed about this and went forhim. He then sent the two sergeants outatalogueReferehcekv4/187 him why he had got sore7(6Kenneth said that he was accustomed to beingtalked to in that sort of way and thoughtit was time Caine got a slap in the eye.After this Cain very much changed his tuneand smoothed it all over by taking Kennethto dinner at the canteen. He then dis-covered that Kenneth h d been in the officesince 1936 and had also been in control ofa region since the beginning of the war.This was evidently rather a shock to him.K'S youthful appearance had evidentlymisled Cain who thought he was a young pupjust down from the University who knewothing about anything.Incidentally, an amusing incident occurredat the outset of the case, when Cain firstinterviewed LISBOA. The latter was veryworried at the accusations, and hinted toCain that as he was the official at theEmbassy in charge of the issuing of decora-tions and orders, if Cain would lay off himhe would see what he could do for him.!It emerged during Kenneth's conversation witCain that the appointment of the C.I.D. mento our office had caused deep resentmentamong the officers of S.B. who felt thatthey had lost promotion in consequence. The,thought that if we had wanted police assistance it should have been drawn from S.B. aand not C.I.D. Personally I think they arequite right. In fact it is exactly whatwe told Swinton and Crockery would happen.IIt will obviously take a very long timebefore this sore is healed.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/187117I attended a meeting of the J.I.C. todayto discuss the Twenty Committee. D.N.I.had bjected to the participation of HomeDefence Executive, Home Forces, and Turner'sorganisation Davidson the new D.M.I. tookthe chair and handled the matter very well.It was eventually agreed that all thesedepartments would have to be represented.I had a number of questions on policy whichwere all dealt with by the D's of I. Thsaid they were quite ready to take responsi-bility except in major cases where theythought they might have to consult theirChiefs ofStaff. I really think that at lastwe have got the Twenty Committee on itsfeet. C.Masterman is an excellent chairmanand I think we ought to have a very goodshow.The question of the suppression of the C.P.is under active discussion. Leggett thinksthat both the Daily Worker and the Partyshould be dealt with and is supported inthis by Bevin. Morrison thinks that onlythe D.W should be suppressed. I gatherthat he and Bevin do not get on. Leggettfeels that the Trade Unions are losingtheir grip and that it is time somethingwas done by the Government which wi ill givethem the support they need. Possibly he isright, but at the moment there is no seriousdislocation due to Communist activity.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/18775January thSpent the day between Scotland Yard and theF.O. on the Muselier Case. I first saw Edenandtole him more or less what the positionwas. He wanted me to put up a note in con-junction with Strang, and Malkin the legaladviser, which he would show to the P.M.at 4 o'clock. He did not seem to be veryconcerned about it all, as the baby wasobviously with the P.M. who would have toeat humble pie to de Gaulle.I went back to the Yard where I had a longinterview with COLLIN and also with Howard.COLLIN confessed to me the whole story.He did not implicate Howard beyond sayingthat hehad on one occasion remarked that theonly kind of information that was any goodwas adocument. It was this that had givenCOLLIN his cue. He would not say thatHoward had asked him to forge the documents.Howard tells the same story but did not givea convincing explanation as to why he hadnot reported the alternative date on thefirst document. He insisted that he had hada complete lapse of memory. Strang and Iand Malkin composed the document for theP.M. and Eden returned shortly after 4,saying that the P.M. had ordered the imme-diate relea se of all those arrested. Ithen went to see Morrison and explained thepesition to him. He said he would issue thenecessary orders. He was Slightly criticalof our action, but understood the positionwhen I explained that the documents had beenCatalogue put forward ReferenCe:KV/I4/187 with the greatest reserve.aThere was a meeting of the Swinton Executivetoday at which the Communistsitua was.discussed but no decision was arrived at.January lOthHad a long talk with Harker about theregistry and John Maude. John had lunchedwith Hordern's wife who had been talkingwith her registry friends. She had founthem all in the depths of despair. Johnasked her to put her impressions in writingand she foolishly typed them out in theregistry. Miss Hollis looked over hershoulder, whipped the document out of thetypewriter and took it to Horrocks. The fatwas then properly in the fire and the eryof "discipline" went up. I said to Harkerthat it was obviously unfortunate that thisdocument had reached him in this way butwhat I felt was far more important was toget at the real truth of the matter. Werethe controlling officers and the two ladieswho put the anonymous report on John's tableall a pack of liars or not. If they werenot, obviously something was very wrongand ought to be put right. He said thatmuch ofwhat the controlling officers hadsaid in their memo was alreadybeil dealtwith, that staff was being recruited andthat the index was being put in order. Ipointed out to him that the drive to re-cruit staff had only occurred after theregistry memo had been presented, and asa result of it, and that the same appliedto the putting in order of the current cardsCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18770which might have been done 3 months ago.I then told him that the whole of B.Branchand most of the office including the regis-try had got the impression that Horrockswas regarded as a kind of oracle and thatit was no good saying anything in criticismof his system or organising powers. Ifanybody did this they were told they wereill-disciplined and nothing was ever done.He said that complaints should go up in theproper way. I said that everybody felt thatnow the normal channel was no ge d andthe mere fact that the documents had beenlaid on John's table was proof of this.Isaid finally that as long as Potter wasthere and until something was done to putsome inspiration into the registry, thingswould more or less remain in their presentunsatisfactory state.Morton tells me that the P.M. has given anorder that the A.G. is to enquire into thewhole circumstances of the Muselier caseand to consider a prosecution.January llthI had a talk with Petrie today at lunchtimeabout the registry. I told him quite frank-ly what I thought was the position. Helistened to what I had to say but did notsay very much himself except that he thoughtthe registry was one of our main problemsand that until it was right it was impossibleto get the office straight. I am afraid thatif he will not let us talk frankly aboutCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187321personalities his reporton the organisationwill not be of much value.A German named HAUSHOFER, in whom Curry wasinterested several years ago on account ofhis work on geopolitik, has written to theDuke of Hamilton whom he knew personallysome years ago. His letter dealt with familymatters and concluded by saying how much hewould like to see Hamilton if ever anopportunity arose. He said he could meet hisany where on the continent. Hamilton isnow a squadron-leader in the Air Force.Wehave approached Archie Boyl who is pre-pared to send Hamilton on some mission toLisbon. The whole case looks rather likea peace offer of some sort.The Beaver has been going round the intern-ment camps and wants to release 657 enemyaliens for use under M.A.P. Morrison hassaid that he will not release any of themunless the Security Service are satisfiedthat there is nothing serious against them.It seems to be a hopeless task trying tokeep enemy aliens out of important arma-ment industries.January 12thJohn is being sent to Cardiff to enquireinto certain ifficulties which have arisenbetween Ford and Lane. Harker has told himthat this is quite a genuine'move and Johnhas accepted the position, although I thinkhe suspects quite rightly that the difficul-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/187THIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION3 (4) OF THE PUBLIC.BECORUSACT 1958. More 2ec0ties about Ford have come as a neaven-sentopportunity for getting rid of him fromBlenheim, where he is regarded as a focalpoint for grievances. Action was takenwithout any reference to my self and if Johnhad ob jected I should have probably blownup.January 13thI saw the A.G. today on the subject of theMuselier Case. He was very pleasant aboutit all. I explained to him exactly howthe case had arisen, that the action takenhad not been on our advice. We had in factonly presented the documents becausethere was no alternative and had emphasiseothe fact that the source was not verified.He went through de Gaulle's points with me,andagreed that there was very little inthemone. way or another.An unpleasant incident occurred thisafternoon. SOMER, one of the parachutists,knocked down his keeper, then tried tothrottle him, and finally tied him up. Heot hold af a motorcycle and canoe from aneighbouring barn nd set forth in thedirection of Newmarket. Here he fell offhis bicycle, and handed himself over tothe police. The following is Paulton'saccount of the incident:"On Monday afternoon Jan. 15th, at about 2.30I was sittling playing a game of doublealagteReferehee:kvramgzsuddenly atacked me.he sprang at me from behind and with a173piece of rope about 20" long tried togarrotte me. L naturally struggied withhim, but he is a much heavier and strongerman than I am and I was unsuccessful.I eventually succeeded in throwing myselfsideways and we fell on the floor in frontof the fireplace still struggling. Stillholding the rope like a pair of reins he gothis knee into the small of my back and toldme not to struggle. AS I felt exhaustedI lay still for a moment - verything hadmomentarily blacked out - andas he tied myhands behind my back he said that "he hadto do it although he knew it was a hangingjob but he could not go on". He expressedregret for his treatment of me and said Iwould only have to wait until 6 o'clockuntil someone we were expecting would return.I told him that I could not lie tied on thefloor all that time and asked him to put meon the chesterfield. He agreed and helpedme over to it. With to other pieces ofrope which he produced from his pockets hethen tied my ankles and a longer piece wasfastened round my upper aris. I was in anuncomfortable position on the chesterfielcand I askedhim to put a pillow under my 2D-this he did.He then proceeded to empty my pockets. Frommy right hand trousers pocket he took somesmall change and my keys, from the left pocketa rosary, a couple of coins, a medal and asmall penknife, together with a broken box ofmatches. He put the small change in hispocket and put the rest of the things on thetable which was quite near the chesterfield.From my inside pocket he took a wallet and aCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1877r"black pencil. He glanced through the walletand thrust it in his pocket, havingtakenfrom it his own identity card and seaman'sbook, as well as my identity card. I toldhim that it only contained personal thingsSO he took it out again and threw it on thetable. He took several things from my sidepockets and after glancing at them threw themon the table. Taking my keys he asked whichwas the key of the desk in the study. I toldhim and he went into that room spending sometime there. He apparently opened the safeand finding an envelope in my petty cashbook - in the drawer in the safe - with aboutE5 in notes took them. He also took the twocrystals which were kept locked in the safe.He went through the desk but I do not thinkhe took an ything. The things taken fromthe safe I discovered afterwards of course.He returned through the dining room and thelounge and shutting both doors went out. Hewas gone some time in the kitchen and thenwent upstairs. Shortly after he went outthe telephone in the study rang - the bellis in the hall - and I called him but heignored it. A little later he came downwith his suitease and going back to thestudy collected all the maps which we had.In the lounge he took another map and mytorch. He als came over and tore my wristwatch from my wrist as hecould not undo it.In a drawer I think he found a child'scompass. He took the case out into thekitchen and collected a number of tins ofthings ( 2 sardines, 1 pilchards, L pears and1 pineapple). He also collected a piece ofcold beef which was in the larder and 3 boxesCataloglietreferenee:kvpanpseviously taken L box of12550 Gold Flake from the lounge which I hadgiven him that morning, and another bax of50 Players from the top of my desk in thestudy.He returned in a short time with a couple ofdirty handkerchiefs and told me that he woulhave to gag me. I told him that it was notnecessary and that I could hardly swallowand asked him to fetch me a glass of water.He went out and got one and helped me todrink. He then went out shutting thedoors. I lay still for some time and laterheard him go out to the kitchen.A After thatall was quiet. I could not be sure that hehad gone but I thought I would take a chanceSO I wriggled off the sofa and stood uprighton my feet. I forgot to mention that beforehe put me on the sofa which stood across thefrench windows he had closed the shutters.In the half light I could see the electricclock and I think it was ten to three. Ispotted my penknife on the table, and aftergroping behind my back, having first toshift the glass of water, I succeeded inpickingit up. As I thought I heard a soundoutside I threw myself back on the sofa withthe knife, which I had succeeded in opening, still in my hand. As I heard nothingfurther, I set to work with the knife andafter a struggle succeeded in cutting mywrists free. I then cut the rope from myankles and around my arms.I listened carefully and henycrept into thestudy and at 3 o'clock dialled Major Dixonat Cambridge and reported the escape. Iasked him whether he would advise London orCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18776whether I should do it and he asked me toreport to H.Q.I passed the call and waited by the phone.Just as the exchange rang to give me thecall SuMMeRpassed SUMMeR passed the window outside push-ing Williams motor bike, which he had startedup, and carrying on his back a canvas canoe.I grabbed th e receiver from the instrumentind put it down on the desk, while I crouchecdown. SUMMER tried to start up the motor-bike with the boat on his back, but he washaving some trouble. I read the number ofthe bike, CXP 654, and jotted it down on aslip of paper on the desk. I also noticeathat he was wearing Williams leather coatand that his Case wasstrapped on the backon the bike. He was still having trouoleand I was afraid he would come back in thehouse for something. Meanwhile the phonewas ringing silently in front of me. Hethen proceeded to tie the boat on somehow onthe side of the bike and at 3.25 made offslowly downthe drive. I waited a momentor SO in case he returned and then put aall through to London and reported thesscape to r.Marriott at 3.30. At 3.35Major Dixon arriyed and we set off inpursuit.Clearly SUMMeR can never be allowed to usehis wireless transmitter again and he willhave to remain under lock and key.It has been finally decided to go for theD.W. under Section 2D of D.R. and subsecuent-CatalogueMorrison has dug histoes in apouu theTHIS IS A COPYTHIS IS A COPYORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEDORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINEEPARTMENT UNDER SECTIONIN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECT3 (4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS3 (4 OF THE PUBLIG RECORACT19582uodJanuaryLACh 19582g0oI had a discussion with Gilbert about hisposition in the office. Dick was suggest-ing that perhaps he might come over to B. 2a.Gilbert-thinks that he might be a littleout of place. I think he really feels thathe should be in a more responsible positionand that in any case should be runningown show. It is rather difficult tohave him in under these circumstances andI should in any case be reluctant to see himgive up the W.O. altogether. Desmond Orris I think too meaodramatic to be left incharge of Room 055. Gilbert told me aboutthe arrangement for the departure of HalifaxElaborate precautions have been taken byI.S.S.B. Bogus luggage had been sent downto Liverpool which was to be placed onboard the "Port Jackson" and Sno'n aas askedwhether to put over a message indicatingthat Halifax would be on this boat. Whenthey got to Liverpool they found that theship was not going to America at all, andthe bogus luggage was thereupon transfedto the Warwick Castle with the necessarypublicity. In actual fact Halicax is leav-ing on a cruiser from Scapa and Winston,accompanied by a pack of journalists and halfWardour Street are going up to watch theincident and have it filmed.

This seemedto come as rather a surprised. It willbe little short of a miracle if we don'tlose the Port Jackson, the Warwick Castle,the cruiser and Halifax.Inspector Baines came to see me about thecase of Serocold SKEELS and VAUGHAN, bothof whom had been associated with the NordicLeague. Certain documents have now beenfound indicating that the Nordic Leaguewas in closer touch with Germany than weimagined. D.PP. thinks there should be acase under the Treachery Act.January 15thSpoke to D.S. S. today about making plans fora possible invasion. Firstly we shouldneed rations and accommodation for thestaff at Blenheim who would not be able totravel daily to Oxford until the situationhad been cleared up. We might also have totake serious steps to protect Blenheimfrom parties of parachutists. There was alscthe question of the evacuation of our Londonoffice in the event of heavy bombing byH.E. H.

There ought to besome plan for housing us at Blenheim ifthe occasion arose.Petrie has seen Maude,H Hollis and Stamp.Maude seems to have been thoroughly de-Catalogue CatalogueReferenceiv+4/1s7view. Stamp did notseem very happy about the situation either.719Roger was less unfavourably impressed.None of them seemed to think that theenquiry was very searching and there wasno discussion of personalities. I havenot yet had Curry' views.January l6thWe had a long discussion this morningabout SUMMER future and that of theother people with whom hehas been associated.We have all come to the conclusion thatsomehow or other SUMMER must be eliminated.This is not however an easy matter. In theeyes of the Germans he is known to Mac andhe has also been in touch with Tate.Through Mac he is known to Snow. If there-fore ve report that he has been capturedthe Germans may think that the whole organ-isation has been compromised. Variousingenious suggestions have been made. Thebest 1 think is that Mac should report thatSummer is on the run, that he has put hiswireless into the cloak room at Cambridge,and sent the key to Mac. Later we could saythat he has been picked yp by the policefor failing to register and later stillSnow can put forward another candidate whowill use his set.M. has got a curious case involving thepurchase of a large amount of dollars by aman called CONYNGHAM at prices ranging from4/10 to 7/-. CONYNGHAM was introduced toone of M'S agents by LONSDALE, the ex-Mayfairboy. He has already passed 65 dollars toCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187730CONYNGHAM at the price of 4/10. I haveasked Burt to find out whether there isan ordinary criminal motive for transactionsof this kind.January 17thWe had a directors meeting this morning.D.S.S. stated thatthe Cabinet were consider-ing bring back to this country a number oftalianprisoners from Libya. These menare to be used to work on the land. Thematter is to be discussed by the Executive.D.D.S.3 was asked to sound Home Forces inthe meantime.We then discussed possible invasion as faras it affected the office in the countryand in London. I gather we have a platoonind 2 machine guns in the country and thatsteps are now being taken to get in ironrations and palliasses. It was generallyagreed that it would not be possible for thestaff to move about. They would havetoremain in the office. There do not appearto be any arrangements for our evacuationfrom London ii necessary. I said that Ifelt pretty sure that whether we were inSt.James! St or the Serubs we might wellfind the conditions impossible, and thatwe ought to have some kind of plan. Itwas suggested that something might be doneto provide our L.D.V. with uniforms andpossibly to get them into a state of greaterpreparedness. The difficulty is that theyare all very hard-worked.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/187121I attended the lunch at Claridges givenby Herschel Johnson for Clegg and Hince.I had a talk with Herschel afterwards aboutWENNERGREN. He said that if I would givehim a note he would send it over to Washing-ton by bag and make the suggestion thatsomebody should say something privately tothe Duke. He quite saw the point that awarning from that quarter might be moreprofitable than one from here.The dollars case is developing.There is to be a meeting on Sunday morningat which it is suggested that two notesof l, ,000 dollars each should be passed.The whole set-up is on Edgar Wallace linesWe are consulting the C.I.D. and shallprobably pull in the lot.Harvey, Turner's assistant, has turnedout to be a poet, and has produced thefollowing rather amusing verses:"O h, sing a song of EnglandWhere Justice holds the scalesAnd Freedom's banner floats unfrAnd aliens are promptly hurledInside the strongest gaols,Where dubious non-Aryansand stateless vegetariansPeruse their censored mails.!In England's happy atmosphereThe lion and the ambEvince reciprocal goodwillWhat time they browse in PentonvillCatalogue ReferenCE:kt/4718he Or their ease at Ham,3And Turks at their convenienceMake merry with Armebians,And no one cares a damn.In England all are equal -The harmless refugee:The Danish mate who's found ashore,But still by Article 3(4)Is deemed to be at sea;The destitute MoravianWhose views are just too ShavianFor chaps like you and me.There's none that lacks a champion;He may be just a Hun,Or else a Quisling self-confessed;Yet Burgin's high disinterestExtends to everyoneWith fervour but sobrietyHe sponsors their anxietyThat Justice shall be done.Not theirs the squalid ritualThat plagues the 18B'S,With Birkett's maudlin sermonettesAnd Toby's complicated betsTo bring them to their knees;Where ultra-legal suavityDisguises the depravityOf bribing the police.For all the "friendly! neutralsGet fair and equal play;They pour their woep in Lindley' ealAnd, though th at organ does nothear,Catalogue eference.KVAmare astray;733For Theo tells him what to do(Or, anyway, what not to do)Before they have their say.They are not told the reason why,But still they cannot failTo see that someone must have foundSome sort of kind of legal groundFor keeping them in gaol,SinceEngland and DemocracyAre strangers to hypocrisyAnd Justice must prevail.Clegg has comeclean about the Group l0messages. He tells us that he has some 30 H.XX agents placed in various factories andthat he is feeding the Germans with mis-leading information. Contact between these30 agents and theGermans is maintained byone courier who apparently brings the funds.J anuary l3thI saw Gwyer, who is a new recruit for .2a.He is an intellectual type and in his pre-sent job of S.I.G.S. obviously a squarepeg in a round hole.

CONYNGHAM and TAFFY have been arrestedThey said they sold the dollars to a mancalled Auguste who has a cafe in Soho andthat there is somebody else behind Auguste.Enguiries in this direction are beingpursued. The general impression in the C.I.1is that the case is purely a confidencetrick.The Sunday Express has come out with ablaze about the Gofernment's pr posalsto deal with the C.P. In actual factthey go rather further than the Government'intentions, which were to deal solely withthe Daily Worker. Leakage seems to havebeen deliberate and will of course severelyprejudice any chances of finding nythingat the Daily Worker office, when they areraided tomorrow. Personally I feel inclinedto call the whole thing off for a couple ofmonths.January 20thT.A.R. and Cowgill had a meeting withRainbow today, which appears to be satis-factory.

Tried to get hold of FindlaterStewart but found that he had flu.I discussed today with Roger Swinton'snote about measures he considered necessaryto deal with communist activities in thefuture. We both agreed that it was ratherinsulting to the office since it suggestedto those to whom it had been circulatedthat we had not been keeping an eye onthese matters. We both felt that it wouldbe disastrous if communist matters were infuture be collated at the centre wherethere would be nobody to assess it at itspreper value. Roger is going to tryand draft a reply to Swinton's memo, pointingout that the points he mentioned arealready covered and suggesting that thecollation of the information should remainin our hands.The Boothby report has come out. Theopinion of the committee is that hisconduct was contrary to the normal usageand derogatory to his position as a memberCatalogue Referenee:KV/4p8s resigned from the736Ministry of Supply but not from his con-stituency.

It is a joint opera-tion between the services and HomeDefence Executive.January 22ndDirectors meeting this morning. Charlesinformed us about what had been doneto protect our country seat. We havean officer and 40 men and two old Hotch-kiss guns. The men only have 30 roundsper rifle and there are about 700 roundsfor the Hotchkiss guns. Steps are beingtaken to get more ammunition but Igather that there is some difficultyaboutthis. The local L.D.V. are not veryinterested in us and are concerned mainlywith the defence of their own village.The nearest military assistance is about12 miles away. Efforts are being madeto get two mechanised vehicles placed atour disposal in time ofemergency. Thereis apparently plenty of barbed wireavailable, but the local air force unitis going to suggest that the ground infront of the Palace should be dealt within such a way as to render it impossibleas a landing ground.I lunched with Charles today. He told methat he had very long talk withCatalogue Reference:KV14/187737Petrie. While he thought he was perhapsa little too slow and old, he was im-pressed by his thoroughness. He does notthink that Petrie will take over the job.He seems to be taking the line thatthere are a certain number of differencesto be smoothed over and certain adjyst-ments to be made but that apart fromthese there was not very much wrong withthe organisation. I told Charles Ihad seen Petrie on the previous day andthat he had asked me to consider whatduties I could dispense with. I had toldhim there were many administrative mattersand matters affecting alien control withwhich I should be thankful not to bebothered. Apart from this I couldget along all right. I was alreadygetting a certain amount of relief andas people gained experience I would getmore. He seemed to think that perhapsI could hand over the subversive block.I said that I felt it was necessary forsomebody to co-ordinate the work ofthese sections very closely with the workof the other sections of .Branch, andthat if cases of espionage arose theywould have to be dealt with in their ownenvironment. Petrie struck me as beingrather imbued with the Swinton-Horrockspoint of view. I'm not altogether sur-prised since none of the B. .officers hehas seen seem to have had an opportunityof expressing themselves freely aboutthe organisation. They have all beenclosely confined to the particular jobatalogueyReferenee.kv/4/18 think Petrie is738thoroughly alive to the importance ofthe registry. He is making a study ofthe S.I.S. and S.Y. registries. He thinksthere should be more direction from theinvestigation branches as to how papersshould be filed and that if this were donethe review section would not be necessary.This would seem to involve pulling backthe review eection into the investigationsections. He seemed to think that thedifferences of opinion about the registrywere causing a good deal of dislocationand "ill-discipline". I am sorry thathe has got this cliche of "ill-discipline"I am sure that neither the officers nor thestaff are fundamentally ill-disciplined.They are merely suffering from a feelingof frustration about the work. I havespoken to V.V. about this and hope thathe may be able to put the matter rightas he is lunching with Petrie today.Clegg came today to say goodbye. He isleaving by air tomorrow. We havearranged that all urgent matters will betelegraphed through S.I.S. and that wewill send him a copy of any letters affec-ting his department which we send throughthe Embassy. Up to now he has not beengetting any of the letters we have sentto the State Dept. I told him to try anddig these out as there wax much usefulmaterial buried in Dunn's offices. Cleggseemed thoroughly satisfied with hisvisit, which I am sure will be veryprofitable to us both. I asked himCatalogueereferehee!kvi4n87ible to do anything139about the seamen who were being bribedby German agents tn north and southAmerica not to rejoin their ships. Hesaid that they were making a thoroughinvestigation into the finances of theunions concerned and that if they foundany trace of foreign money they intendedto take action. He also knew of theproposal of the British seamen's unionto send a delegate over who had handledthis matter in the last war.January 23rdMajor Walker called today to recounta rather curious incident that occurredat the Dorchester. One of the officersof London District Headquarters wasstaying at the Dorchester. He rang up hisH.Q. to speak to the night duty officer.Some stranger came on the line sayingthat he was the night duty officer. Ashe obviously wasn't, the officer at theDorchester put down his receiver andwent round to the H.Q. excange. He askedthe girl on the telephone whether she hadput him through to the night dutyofficer and she said she had not butthat a strange voice had cut in. Theofficer then went back to the Dorchesterand tackled one of the receptionclerkscalled CAMPBELL. Campbell picked uphis receiver to find out who was on theexchange, and then said that he had hadhis suspicions aboutthe man for some weeksEnquiries are being made.Catalogue CatalogjueRefererce:KV4r87an e:KV4F87and Home Defence Execu-740tive are carrying out their mock invasionexercise.

Nobody told usabout the code word and had wenot heard bya side wind that something was going on wemight have had people operating all overthe country. I gather that other offices whehave been similarly served are kicking upa stink.I attended a meeting of the Twenty Committeetoday when various schemes were discussed.We are to go ahead with Plan I. which is ascheme for getting the Germans to bomb awood on the assumption that it is full ofammunition. We also discussed Stringer'splan for telling the Germans that all ourtroops are going to have some specialidentification mark in the event of invasionThe idea is that the Germans should use thisidentificatic mark and that we should not.The suggestion is being made to Home Forceswho have 1I gather already given a good dealof consideration to the problem.

Snow has also been toldthat he can give Summers' wireless set toSam STEART "who is believed to be allright".I had a long talk with V.V. He told me thatPetrie was very anxious that I should havean opportunity of giving him quite franklyall my views about the office. He said thatPetrie was particularly anxious not to re-commend anything which did not more or IesSmeet with my approval I gather thatPetrie was impressed by Horrocks's abilitybut it seemed to me that he had not alto-gether got our side ot the picture, partic-ularly as regards the registry.January 25thI had a talk with Petrie about W. andafterwards he say Frost. He evidently feelsthat W. should be an integral part of B.Branch. I spent between 3-4 hours during thafternoon discussing with Diek, T.A.R. R. andCowgill the answer which should be givento the Snow message about infra-red. SnowCatalogue uERefefertce:KV14/187 put the thing on a7y2high plane and meet the man himself. Thishad obvious disadvantages since if we wantedto arrest the individual concerned it wouldbe difficult to do SO without compromisingSnow. T.C. was rather in avour of crack-ing down as he felt that if the informationwas really vital and could not go Snow waslikely to be compromised anyhow. Eventuallywe decided to draw the other side on thewuestion of whether their informant had awireless set, and to suggest that withinthe next 24 hours at a given time the unknowrinformant should drop his informationthoough a letter box. If a mess ige came bac.to the effect that the meeting could nottake place we should at least have ascertainwhether the informart had a wireless set.General Spears rang. up during the eveningto say that he had received our memo aboutliaison with the Free French Forces but thatwhile he realised the urgency of the uestiohe hoped that that we would leave it to hisdiscretion to act at the most appropriatemoment. He said that things were boilingup on other lines and that there wouldprobably be a major show-down before long.January 26thAt Vinchester.January 27thI had about to hours benevolent cross-examination by the Attorney General todayon the Muserier case. Generally speaking,he seemed to that our letter in whichCatalogue Reference.KVI4/187 Reference.143we. said that we were "fairly reasonablycertain about the authenticity of thedocuments" did not perhaps sufficiently showthe red light, even though we had statedthat the man GOMEZ had not been identifiedand that COLLIN was not an entirely satis-factory person. He thought it was a pitythat we had put in the word "entirely".He then asked why we had not pursued moreactive enquiries after the first docu-ment had been obtained. I pointed outto him that we had proceeded in the normalmanner to try and find out what COLLIN'Scontacts were and who was behind him. Thiscould only be done by observation of onekind or another and under present conditionsof the black-out was bound to take aconsiderable time. Had we adopted thecourse that we were eventually forced toadopt, namely to tell COLLIN that we hadno confidence in him and thatwe wishedJannings to accompany him on his visitto the Brazilian Embassy, it would have beenimpossible for us, as in fact it wis now,to find out who if anybody had been at theback of COLLIN. It was therefore onlywhen we came to the conclusion that it Wasimperative to clear the matter up immediate-ly that we did get hold of COLLIN, tell himthat we did not believe his story, andinssted on his being accompanied by JanningsHe seemed to think that this was a reason-able explanation. I have the generalimpression that he is going to place a smallamount of responsibility on us for whatultimately happened. I gave him a veryclearpictureof my first verbal interviewCatalague RererencekV/4is Reference he made a careful note744The information was evidently new to him.A reply has come back to Snow that thedocuments could not possibly be deliveredat the time and place stated since the otherside would have to communicate with theirinformant by letter.January 23thI had to attend a meeting at the Centrefrom ll a.m. to 2.5 p.m. It was on thesubject of ways and means for dealing withthe German efforts to suborn our seamen.Jarman and Sneddon of the Seamen's Unionwho were going to the United States, gavethe meeting their impressions both on thisquestion and on the question of the highwages being drawn by alien seamen here andthe consequent unrest among British se eamen.The particular offenders are the Greeks whoget 23 times as much as any British seamen.The consequen is that the Greek seamensome of whom drew very high wages indeedare not anxious to go to sea. The sameapplies in a lesser degree to other national-ities, such as the Dutch, Danes andNorwegians. Efforts are being made to getthis matter rectified. The meeting thenwent on to discuss the Communist situation.There was apparently a certain amount OIagitation both among Greek seamen at Cardiffand Chinese seamen at Liverpool. The latterwere being aided and abetted by the ChineseConsul. There have been no serious reactionsto the closing down of the Daily Worker andthe Week but Swinton wished to have anyinformation on this subject that might comeCatalogue Reference:KVI4/1877u5to hand. There is I gather to be a weeklymeeting of Walls Committee at which RogerHollis will represent this office. Walldoes not want anything in the nature of aweekly report but merely any informationwhich might show new developments.I lunched with Herbert of the Censorship.We talked about one of his officers, NormanSMITH, who has aroused a certain amountof anxiety. I told him that we would talSMITH'S telephone and let him know theresult. We also discussed the case of desGRAZ. I told Herbert that as far as Icould See there was nothing against him butthat of course we had not made any verysearching enquiries.Victor has been to see the Ministry ofSupply about the case of Alvis STRAUSSLER,about whom we have arned the authoritiesfor many years. He has now been given ourmost secret light tank in order that hecan design amphibian attachments. Thesituation has come to a head as we havediscovered that STRAUSSLER has been workingfor Mitsubishi and that they now want hirto go as adviser to the Japanese MilitarMission at a salary of El,000 p..a. TheMinistry of Supply want to know whetherwe can intern STRAUSSLER. We have told themthat he has really committed no offencebut that if they like they can make repre-sentations to the Home Office.

Thereare immense di ficulties owing to the factthat we now have to employ people from thearmy and that if they are not to get a dropin salary we have to pay them a very highrate if it is to be taxable. The Treasuryhave ordered that from now onwards any offi-cer taken on here is to pay income tax. Thismeans that we have to raise our basic rate.This is being done by an arbitrary figure whwhich to be quite fair should really vary inaccordance with the officers income. Insome cases this may meansa great deal andin others aothing at all. The case wascited of an eminent gentleman to whom E400a year free of tax was the equivalent ofabout 13,000 p.January 30thI had a long talk with Cain about theMuselier case. I had seen Lennox previously.He had been asked to go round have talkto Cain on certain aspects of the case.Cain's manner to Lennox had caused consider-able annoya ance. I don't think he meansanything very much but he is undoubtedlysomewhat of a megalomaniac. He has anCatalogue Reference:KVI4/187141unfortunate and somewhat offensive manner.This is now the experience of 3 of ourofficers, Kenneth, Derek Tangye and Lennox.He generally starts by being very melo-dramatic and putting forward some ratherfantastic theory but eventually he seemsto settle down to the point. I told him thathe ought not to get the idea that we havegot anything to hide or have had any part inaiding and abetting Howard. I explainedto him exactly what our relations withHoward had been and exactly how the casehad started. I emphasised that from thevery st rt we had put forward the informationwith the greatest reserve and that while wecould not see any flagrant discrepancies inthe text, we had never been satisfied aboutthe source. Action however had been orderedwithout any further reference to thisdepartment. Cain had previously madesomerather wild statements to Lennox, one ofthem being to the effect that Norman Kendalwas gunning for me.January 3lstSpent the morning at home working atpapers. Saw Luke in the afternoon. Hehad just got back from visiting the censor-ship in Glasgow,Liverpoo and Manchester.H e thinks that we should have a senior manat censorshipheadquarters in London andpossibly a staff of two officers under him.These officers would maintain linison withManchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and any otheoutstations of the censorship. He thoughtCatalogue Catalogueeference:KV47187 officer at Liverpool.748He is quite convinced that M. M.I.12 I. havenot been serving our interests and thatwe shall never get real value from thecensorship until we have our own represen-tatives. Luke is now somewhat at a looseend and rather anxious to leave W. wherehe says there is nothing for him to do.I am thinking possibly of putting him into.2a, but I believe that he had previouslybeen earmarked for some enquiry intosecurity measures among shipping firms underD.2.There is to be a meeting between Gen. Spears,Harker,mys myself and the nen French GeneralPETIT who has recently joined de Gaulle'sforces. They are to discuss further measuresfor security within the F.F.F. and liaisonwith this department.February lst.Another parachutist has been dropped, witha wireless set and E500 somewhere in Huntingdonshire. He has broken his ankle. Sofar we have no further particulars but heis being sent to Cannon row for interroga-tion this evening. I gather that therewere four other planes in the vicinity atthe time. It is possible therefore thatothers may have been dropped. We arearranging for a search to be carried out.I sa a representative of M.E.W. today, whowanted to talk to me about the case ofSOFINO. The firms headquarters were formerlin Brussels but by a ruling of the board thewere transferred to wherever the seat ofCatatlogue eReferencekv/4/7ht be. This was7uathought desirable as if they were operatingfrom enemy territory their profits wouldobviously be liable to be taken over bythe Enemy Trading Dept. It seems that theM.E.W. have definite evidence that SOFINOand/or its subsidiaries have been tradingwith the enemy and further that they have trtransferred a large portion of their assetsinto dollar securities in order to avoidconfiscation and taxation. Negotiations aregoing on for a settlement and very largesums indeed are involved. They run intomillions. The rperesentatives of sofinohere are a firm called RUNAPLES, on theboard of which are Lord Swinton, ReginaldMcKenna and Lord Wigram. The leagalrepresentatives are a man called Diplock anda Jew of Russian origin, IDELSON. Throughthese negotiations, which were initiated atSwinton's request, the firm made it quiteclear that they accepted the position ofbeing domiciled here in view of the presencein this country of the Belgian Govt. Atelegram has now been intercepted showingthat they are trying to get the board torescind their resolution but the companybeing domiciled with the Belgian Govt. hadto change the domicile to New York. Thereasons are obvious. Diplock now wants togo to Lisbon in order to discuss matters withRICHARD, formerly head of the Belgian officeof Sofino and an extremely tricky customer.M.E.W. do not want him to go until they havegot some agreement out of Sofino about theirassets in America. Equally they do not wishthe company to know that they are try ing toobstruct Diplock's journey as it might makethem less reasonable about the assets inCatalogue.Referenee.Kv/487 on.y get hold of by7Sobringing pressure on the score of enemytrading. I said that I did not see how wecould obstruct Diplock's journey, whichwas really a matter for M.E.W. I do nothowever think that he is likely to be apassage either by boat or plane for someconsiderable time. Simon of M.E.W. saidthat as long as he did not get there duringthe next two weeks he thought it would beall right.It appears that the man probably responsiblefor the incident at the Dorchester the othernight is one Vincent HEPBURN of 11 WestbourneGardens. Enquiries are being made about him.February2nA young Frenchman has arrived, havingescaped from France by air. His story isas follows: His name is COLIN. He is 25years old, and was a civil pilot before thewar. He has done 2,000 hours flying inthe French Air Force during the war as aSgt.Pilot. Our police who interviewed himon arrival thought he seemed a very good typeHe left Vicy at 12.30 on lst February in atwin-engine Caudron which was all ready onthe tarmac. All the personnel had gone tolunch. Knowing that he would be chased heflew blind, and after a certain time hecame down through the clouds and landed inBrittany. He learned from some peasantswhere he was and without giving any explana-tions blind, he and took came off out again, of the once clouds more slightly flyingwest of Plymouth. He knew the guns wouldCatalegneiReferenceiv/4p8z came down very quicklyand landed without delay. The machineis brand new and undamaged. He possesses200 franes, identity papers, his own logbook, two bad maps and a small suitcasewith personal belongings. He is delightedto be in this country and wants to jointhe R. .A.F. A.Bingham is investigating the case of aman called LEAFLAND who came to noticeas the result of a motor-accident. Hewas driving a large lorry into a protectedplace and had a crash. He did not seemto be able to give a very coherent accountof himself. He alleged thathe had comeover in the general rush of the refugeeslast year and admitted that he had nopapers of any kind. He has now told us thathe belonged to an international secretservice which collected information fromvarious sources and sold it to the highestbidder. At the moment there seems tobe every reason to believe that he is aGerman spy.The parachutist is at Brixton hospital.He say his name is Josef JAKOBS. Hesays that he was in a concentration campat Oranienburg. This may be true but itis a story that we haveheard before. He hadwith him E500. This is more than any ofthe other agents have brought. He had oneaddress on him, that of Mrs. Lily KNIPS,9 Compayne Gardens, N.W.7, reputedly aJewess with whom JAKOBS intended to communi-cate. JAKOBS said that it was eventuallyCatalogue ataloguerteetence:kv/4n18r America where he hadan aunt.732It is difficult not to be sceptical aboutthese people. Firstly it seems almostincredible that if JAKOBS! story is truethe Germans could imagine that he was goingto be of any real value to them. Secondlywhyaic they give him a registration cardwith no letter prefix. Incidentally itwas one of those about which Snow sentnumbers. If they had wished to alter theletters or the numbers, that would have beendifferent, but to rule out the prefix andput in numbers instead would seem to berather more than a clerical error. Did theyintend that JAKOBS should be captured, onthe assumption that they know that theseXX agents send weather reports and otherinformation which though limited is atleast accurate. If he had a number andname submitted by Snow and Snow vas nottrusted, they might have sent him over totest Snow in some way although it is diffi-cult to see exactly how, since Snow couldperfectly well say that he had been cap-tured owing to the blunder about his regis-tration card. A better test would seemto have been to try and place him in directtouch with Snow. Another point whichoccurs to me is that the Germans must nowbe wise to the game of collaring an agentand forcing him to use his wireless set inour interests. There is in fact evidencethat they are doing it themselves Surelytherefore they would have some arrangement,for example the dropping of the first letterof the prefix by which an agent could indi-cate that he was not acting under compulsionWe know that in some ways the Germans areCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187753extremely crude and sketchy in their methodsand this may of course be the explanationbut I find it difficult to believe.JAKOBS has already agreed to assist us tomake use of his wireless set.A number of messages are coming in onGroup 3 which indicate that the Germans areanxious about theFrench Fleet. Their agentshave been asked to report on its move-ments and whether it is getting up steam.Other messages show anxiety about thealleged recruitment of demobilised Frenchmenwho have got colonial experience. Felixsays that this Group is the one formerly usedby a number of French XX agents and istherefore compromised. He thinks thereforethat these messages are being sent express-ly for our consumption or for that of theFrench. This may be so, but 1 do not seewhy the group should necessarily be compro-mised. Perhaps we are inclined to be toosubtle.February ArdIdined at Ham. Tineye put on aterrific show. verything is run on astrict military basis and as far as I cansee very efficiently. I felt almost royalwhen he turned out the guard. We had a longdiscussion afterwards (a) about methods fordealing more rapidly with parachutists, (b)about the bringing of prisoners to trial(c) about a camp nearby for incurables and(d) about the distribution of informationobtained from ISOS messages.Catalogue Reference.kVi4754As regards (a), we decided that we shouldcollect them direct from the local policestation in our own van and bring themstraight to Ham instead of Cannon-row.(b) It was agreed that V.V. and I shouldmake representations to Swinton thatbumping off should be the exception ratherthan the rule. We all felt that it was farpreferable to keep these people asreference books since we never knew whenthey might be useful or when some furtherpiece of information might turn up whichwould render interrogation desirable.(c) it was agreed that if a suitable sitecould be obtained a mile or two away itwould be an excelllent thing to have acamp for incurables constructed whichcould be directly under Tineye, as a kindof annex to Ham.(d) Felix agreed to let Tineye have thegist of all messages relevant to enquirieswhich he had in hand but insisted thatthese should not be shown to the of ficerengaged in the interrogation, who mightinadvertently give away information ofimportance.February 4thIn the morning we had a meeting withCurry and others concerned in the HARLIPcase. It was agreed that we should takeaction on Thursday and that HUBRICH, RuthGLOVER, LENGYEL and HEINTE should bearrested. M. is making all the necessaryarrangements with the police. The caselooks promising and there is no doubt thatCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18755the ramifications are fairly extensive.HARLIP is to be left untouched for themoment but we are taking steps to gaugehis reactions when he learns of LENGYEL'Sarrest.I had lunch with WINTSCH. As far as I cansee he appears reliable and ready to helpin any way he can. He would be quiteready to go to Lisbon if we could getthe approval of the head of the organisa-tion in Berne. I am going to suggest thisto V.V.Curry came to see me this evening. He wasrather depressed after a two-hour talk withPetrie. He summed up the situation bysaying that the face is the face of Petriebut the voice is the voice of Horrocks.Curry does not seem to have given way aninch.February 5thWe had a director's meeting this morningat which a few minor matters were dis-cussed. I lunched with Thornewill whotold me about the incident at the Savoywhen there was a Communist demonstration.He was anxious to have some cut and driedarrangement with the police, since theWorkers Challenge broadcasting station isurging the communists to send up a bunchof toughs to turn the Savoy upside down.The complaint of the Communists is thatthe rich eat omelettes at the Savoy whileCatalogue the one egg a fortnighttheycanFor this reason756they think that Woolton should go.What is interesting is that the incidenttook place on the 29th and that the broad-cast was made at 8 p.m. on the 31st.The broadcast showed that the account givenmust have been from somebody who wasactually present. There was a certainamount said in the papers on the 30thbut not I think anything on the lines ofthe Workers Challenge broadcast. Theprobability is that the information wentto the Daily Worker who handed it to theSoviet Embassy who in turn passed it outby diplomatic cipher.I had Petrie's account today of his meetingwith Curry. He evidently felt that he wasup against a brick wall. He said he couldnot get Curry to see that it was necessaryto divide the organisation into blocksin order to relieve the responsibility.Isaid that I personally could not followthe argument very clearly since ultimatelysomebody had to pe responsible for every-thing that was going on in the office. Ifelt that relief could only come throughpeople getting sufficient experience, andtaking action on their own. Only in thisway would pressure on the heads of theoffice diminish. From what I can gatherPetrie is thinking very much on the linesof Hor ocks' plan. It is when we come toits practical application that I think weshall begin to fall down.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/187751Rather serious information has reached usfrom special material indicating that theJapanese here have instructions to treatall British subjects with extreme coldnessand to be ready to make a hurried exit.I do not know what indications there arefrom other sources that the Japanese arelikely to come in but it seems fairly clearthat most of those here are stronglyopposed to war. The same II believe applito Japan where everybody is heartilysick of fighting.Skoot has returned with a long and interest-ing questionnaire. He is to go to Parisin about amonth's time, in order to undergoa course before being sent to America.What is interesting is that he has been toldto get his secret ink from Giraffe. Oncemore we come back to the family.February 6thI attended a meeting with Harker at Gen.Spears office where we were introduced toGen. PETIT, who is to discuss questions ofsecurity between ourselves and the Frenc..He told us that all dealings were to bewith himself but I do not imagine thatthis can last very long. sPetit has beenappointed Gen. de Gaulle's chief of staff.He will not be able to handle all thesequestions himself. However this is a goodbeginning. He seems a reasonable kind ofperson. I said that all we required wasto carry on a close liaison with somebodyCatalbgueReferencervi4isge of the General and7s8that we had no wish to pry into theprivate affairs of the F.F.F. We werequite ready however to assist the F.F.F.with the machinery at our disposal in anyenquiries that they wished to carry outabout their own people. Equally we shouldbe very grateful for their assistancein sorting out the French community hereand in establishing who was pro-de Gaulleand who was pro-Vichy.After the meeting I went on to the A.G.Soffice where I was introduced to theCommandant Cabanier. Cabanier has beenattached to the A.G. pending the enquiryinto the Muselier case. He was verypleasant about the whole affair and seemedto see the possession up to a point. Hedid not however give the impression of havilstudied the documents and reports verycarefully. He explained that there werea number of features in the case whichmight very easily lead a Frenchman to thinkthat the whole of the Muselier incident hadbeen staged by the British. He was quiteOready to believe himsef that it was not butto those who did not have much under-standing for intelligence matters he did nothink the position was very clear. Themeeting was a very friendly one and wetold him that we should be very pleased tohelp to clear up any other outstandingpoints. He said that his difficulty wastospersuade the French Navy that the BritisIntelligence Service had not fabricated aplot against Muselier, but that he hopedCatalgae Referemee:k/I4P187 be able to smooththings out.759February 7thSpent the morning at home and then viewedthe new offices. The accommodation isnot bad but we are going to be rathercramped.At midday the news came out that we hadgot Benghazi. We seemed to have covereddistance of 160 miles in 7 days.R.S.S. have picked up a message (on the2nd) showing that a parachutist has landedon the 3lst an. and intends to communicatagain on Sunday. He has given us his pre-fix SO we may be able to pick him up.T.A.R.S T. A. idea is that we should give him abit of a run in order that we may find outexactly how much these peeple can ascertainif they are left to themselves.The HARLIP case seems to be developing inrather an interesting way. We are holdingLENGYEL and HUBRICH. The reactions ofHARLIP and his wife when they heard thatLANGYEL had been arrested were said tohighly significant. I have no detailsat present.February SthWe have had a reaction about infra-red.The documents will not be ready until the daday before Snow leaves. Ityhas thereforebeen suggested that Snow should look atthem and try to memorise the most importantCatalogue points Reference:KVI4/187 He shoylg then put them away in a7cesafe place until his return when theyshould be micro-photographed,. and sent overby some other channel. We are now facedwith the problem of dealing with theindividual who comes to the rendez-vous.My inclination is to bump him, but thereare many difficulties.Burne has returned from his investigationinto the impurities in certain oil whichwas used by our aircraft and which resultedin one case in the loss of a machine andits crew of three. He has establishedbey ond doubt that the trouble was due tobad filtering at the Shell Oil Installationat Ardrossan. Burne was rather worriedabout the attitude of certain representa-tives of the Air Ministry who seemed anxiousto hush up the whole affair in the interestsof Shell.Justice Oliver is going round makingenquiries into leakage of information regard-ing convoys and movements of troops by sea.He has a lot of ground to cover but asfar as he can see the problem is almostinsoluable. Inevitably a very large numberof people have to know about every coMvoyor expedition. The only possibility is tomislead as to time, destination and route.Dick is preparing certain measures to dealwith parachutists through organising localsearches by the military and the Home Guard.We are going to try and give them someprecise directives.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/18776fFebruary 9thAt Brighton.The PAM. made a fine speech, ending upwith an appeal to the Americans, with thewords "Give us the tools, and we willfinish the job". I was a little surprisedthat he emphasised that he did not wantmen. I imagine that he must have donethis in order to assist the passing ofthe Lease and Lend Bill through the Senate.He also mentioned the bombardment of Genoaand hinted that the Germans were preparingan expedition which was to proceed fromGenoa to attack the French forces inAfrica. There may be some truth in thisbut I feel a little that he might againbe window-dressing.February lOthThe general situation is interesting.S.I.S. and other reports indicate thatBulgaria is going to let the Germans inand that the Turks will not fight unlessthey themselves are attacked. There isalready a considerable infiltration intoBulgaria and it is alleged that certainof the aerodromee arenbeing prepared bythe Germans. Reports indicate that theFrench are really with us but are waitingfor the opportune moment. Time is importanas it will enable them to get as manytroops away to Africa as possible.Catalogte Our ereference:kv4/18t 70 miles beyond762,The alleged parachutist's transmitter fromthis country was heard again on Sundaybut turned out to be a communicationbetween Paris and Cracow. This is reassur-ing.ELIADE, the suspect Roumanian, turned upat Bristol today to catch the Lisbonplane. He had in his possession a diplo-Omatic bag but had failed to get it passedby the Permit Censorship Office. 0 n thistechnicality he was told that the bag couldnot go but that he could return with itif he liked in order that the necessaryformalities could be completed. He thensaid he would like to burn the bag, andhe duly left having handed the bag overto Airways for return to the RoumanianLegation.I saw Phil Nichols of the F.O. about thisin case there should be any repercussions.He told me that it had been decided to brealoff negotiations with Roumania on the 15thof this month. We agreed that the Rouman-ians at present interned as reprisals shoube deported and that certain others whomwe disliked should suffer a similar fate.The F.O. were anxious that we should notintern any of the reputable Roumaniansif this could possibly be avoided.I lunched with D.M.I. and gave him thelatest about the activities of the XX CtteeHe seemed interested and satisfied. Wearranged for a meeting of the W. Cttee to-Catalogue e Reference:KVI4/187163Two friends of D.M.I.'s, highly placedofficers in the Air Force, discussed withhim the relavent importance of the variousarms in the Air Force. D.M.I. was interes-ted in getting an increase in reconnaissanceplanes. This would mean a certain sacri-fice but only a small one, in the bomberprogramme. I gather that the P.M. hadgiven orders that our bomber force shouldbe rapidly increased for offensive action.It had remained stationary for a consid-erable time owing to the importance ofbuilding up our fighter strength. Thedifficulty 1 gather was not on account ofproduction but on account d training thenecessary personnel. We have a very widecolonial scheme but the full force of itwill not be felt until about June or July.After the colonial pilots get here theyhave to do at least 2 or 5 months trainingin tactics before they can join theirsquadrons. There appear to be a very largenumber of pilots here who were employed onvarious auxiliary duties but this is re-garded as inevitable.We had a long discussion about thearrangements for the infra-red gentlemanwho is to bring the information to aspecific address on Thursday. We are goingto have a good many B.6 watchers out add acinema camera with a telescopic lens inthe house opposite. The agent will befollowed on leaving the house and if hehas not settled by 4 p.m. m. he will bearrested on account of black-out and thepossibility of losing him altogether.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/187764Swinton came down this afternoon andenquired about the activities of the XXCttee.

I also discussed with himthe question of bumbing off agents. I saidthat from a purely intelligence point ofIlew we were anxious to keep.them asreferencebooks. He suggested that V.V. andI should put up a case.We have just heard that one of our A. A.I.D. D.inspectors in America has written to theGerman consul in Boston offering hisservices.

It was agreed that we wwouldsupply the Spears Mission with the namesof all Frenchmen passing through thePatriotic Schools. This would enable themto meet any queries put to them by Gen.de Gaulle. We said that it was essentialthat we should not be forced to give rea-sons if people were being detained. Thisis especially important as sometimes wetgot S.I.S. agents who have come throughby saying that they are coming to join deGaulle's forces. There are also cases ofFrenchmen whose qualifications are suchthat they may be of use to us or to S.I.S.We do not therefore want their namesbandied round the F.F.F.I went on from this meeting to the D.N.I.

Sir Findlater said that ifSir John Anderson agreed he might stipu-late that on certain questions he mighthave to take the matter still higher.veasked that in this case we should beinformed in order that we should seewhether there was not some other way out.We were particularly anxious that DowningSt. should not come into the picture unlessit was absolutely necessary, since once theservice became known there we should beasked to send over all sorts of messagesCatalogue Whicn ferecenkvy/18mpromising the whole766system. I explained to the meeting thepresent position with regard to Snow, andI handed out copies of our latest question-naire from Skoot. I have asked the Ds. ofI. to let me have an appreciation of thisquestionnaire and would like to know whetherit discloses any serious leakage or whetherit has any other significant points.We then discussed the question of passinginformation obtained from questionnairesto FOES. FOES is an inter-service organisa-tion which puts itself in the posstion ofthe enemy intelligence service, and tries towork out what the enemy is likely to do.It is therefore important for them to haveas much information as possible known tobe in the possession of the enemy. It wasdecided that the three Service represen-tatives on the committee should make aparaphrased version of both our question-naires and S.I.S. questionnaires and thatthis should be given in strict confidenceto FOES.The Japanese Assistant M.

Specialmaterial shows that he is trying to getinformation about the movements of ourships to the China Seas and that for thispurpose he has been in touch with someEuropean.

WEITZMANis also arranging for skilled Jewishtechnicians to come here from America.I told Hawes that I thought that he wouldbe well advised to leave the vetting in thehands of WEITZMAN who was obviously interested in seeing that the division was areally good one.

It willneed very delicate wording if it is notgoing to give offence to the Arabs. Al-though there may be considerable advantagesin the scheme both from the point of financein America and technical skill, I cannothelp feeling that politically it is ablunder, since the whole project will bused as propaganda against us both bythe Arabs and by the enemy. It will more-over pin us down to granting coneessionsto the Jews in Palestine after the war.It is one of those things which are done intimes of crisis and which are bitterlyregretted afterwards.February 14thWe had a meeting on B. 24 this morning. Ithas been decided to divide it into agents,examiners, and those who are running thelanguage sections.

As regards the W.O. printRoger Hollis is going to consult Wallof the Printers Union with a view tofinding a suitable plant for ROTHSTEIN.There has beenan interesting case ofsabotage. Gelignite has been found in acrashed Merlin engine, apparently in theexhaust pipe. It was thought at first thatthe gelignite had been inserted after theengine had been thrown on the scrap heap.Enquiry with Rolls has shown that thedamage to the engine could not possiblyhave been caused by an ordinary crash.Since the machine fell in the sea enquiriesare nowbeing made to see whether the gelig-nite in the engine was impregnated withCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187113sea-water or not. This will prove fairlyconclusively whether it was inserted inthe engine before or after the crash.The pilot baled out and is availableand the log books should give us thehistory of the engine and provide importandata for investigation.February l6thFour bombs fell in the vicinity ofLatchmere at about midday today. Threewere in the field and one in the garden.There was no damage to property or person-nel.I heard that a Heinkel 111 came down atone of our aerodromes a couple Of nightsago in Norfolk. The pilot, being alittle apprehensive as to his whereabouts,took off and came down at another aerodromein Norfolk. Onthis occasion he got outof his machine and asked the OrderlyOfficer where he was. On being told, hegot into his machine again and flew off.The Orderly Officer apparently did notquestion him or ask him where he had Cl.scomefrom. A frightful row is going on inthe Air Ministry about it.February 17thWe had a discussion about Stork, who hasrefused to go into his hou'se at Hendonas his wife is going to have a baby. Thisis unfortunate as we have had the placeCatalogaEReferenee.k4/187 could not tell him774about the locality before as he would havebeen on the premises, which for obviousreasons would have been undesirable.The house will however be very useful forother purposes. We are telling Storkthat he has got to go and do his trans-mission from some specific place. Wehope to get a line on premises from oneof the Post Office people in Dollis Hill.I had a long talk with Joe Archer aboutthe responsibility for security mattersin R.A,E. establishments. He tells methat theyeare all under M.A.P.1 that heis responsible solely for factories, andthat Stammers is responsible for R.A.F.establishments. I asked him about thisbecause I did not want Arnold's activitiesat various experimental stations to getacross his tracks. Joe tells me that thereis a row boiling up on the question ofsecurity in M.A.P. due to the Beaver'sefforts to employ aliens and enemy aliensin aircraft factories. Napiers have beenasked to take on 78 and are stronglyopposed to having any of them in theirassemply shops. They have already absorbeda number in factories of their less impor-tant sub-contractors. They are in a diffi-culty about their main factory since theyare virtually under government control andtherefore to some extent subject to theorders of the Beaver. The managingdirector of Napiers statesy that nearlyall the people he had from internmentcamps have been entirely untrained. HeCatalogue Reference:RV/4/187ses he could have416got British women to do the job just aswell after a period of training. I haveasked Joe to give me the full facts ofthe matter and also on the security aspectof M. A.P. experimental establishments.We shall then have to put this forward inthe form of a memo to the Swinton CommitteeSomething on these lines is essential sinceI gather that the Beaver is proposing toset up his own security service. Thisis going to create an impossible situatlonInspector Fish has just told me that ithas been established that the gelignitefound in the Merlin engine was impregnatedwith sea-water. This proves that it wasinserted before the crash. Unfortunatelywe have now learned thit the pilot hasjust been killed in another smash andwe have therefore lost an important witnessFebruary 18thAt Blenheim. I attended two meetings.In the morning Dick gave a very lucid talkon arrangements to be made for dealingwith parachutists. He supplied usefuldata which should assist the police or themilitary in organising a search. In theafternoon there was another long discussiorabout the functions of R.S.L.O.S at thetime of invasion. I t was the opinion ofthose present that it was desirable thatRegional Commissioners should be as nearas possible to commands, but it becameapparent that the situation varied veryatalogtereferehce.KV4/187t regions. In Wales276for examplethe command would be at Chesterwhereas the Regional Commissioner wasproposing to retire into the hillsof BrecorThere was a good deal of talk about thestage at which power would pass from thecivil authorities to the military, and itseemed firly clear that some sort ofdiarchy would exist. Obviously he milit-ary would act in the battle area but thecivil authorities would continue to func-tion as long as possible in those areasnot actually affected by bombardment fromthe land. A point might well be reachedwhere the police would have to takeorders from the military and it wasthought desirable that the Home Officeshould issue some sort of a warning topolice that such a situation might arise.It was felt that some indication shouldbe given to the police as to the recog-nised authority for giving such orders.I felt very strongly that R.S.L.O.Sshoud attempt to make contact with unitsif possible since it was there that theiradvice WO ld be most useful. If theyremained at regional headquarters or withcommands they would be forgotten and theheadquarters would take action as andwhen they thought fit, without any guid-ance. It was agreed that we should tryand send one or two officers to eachregion as soon as the invasion started.If possible they should be in uniform.They would be able to assist at headquarterand allowuat least the assistant R.S.L.0.Sto get out and about. Communications wouldCatalogue ogueReference.K4igplt The existing177arrangement is that we should communicateby cypher either through the police wire-less or the military wireless, but in thestress of battle military heddquarterswould not hear very much. It was there-fore very desirable that we should be inthe closest touch with Home Forces.Application had apparently been made forD.R.S D. R. S but this had been turned down. Thefunction of Regional Officers throughan invasion would be to give as muchadvice as they possibly could to themilitary regarding special suspects orsubvergive organisations which might beoperating in the rear of oun forces.The interrogation of spies sent throughthe lines disguised in one form or anotheror by parachute troops dropped in therear would be the business of M.I.9.Had a short talk with Curry after themeeting about the SIMONCZEK case.Pilkington is going to employ the DutchmanNOLTE who has already been interviewed.It was also agreed that Mills should joinB. 2a.February 19thDirectors meeting, at which variousmatters relating to invasion were discussedThe latest news on this subject is howeversomewhat reassuring. Nothing I gather isexpected in the immediate future.Lunched today with 5 Americans from theAmerican Legion. They were interested inCatalogue Referenceskt4ll87against sabotage and278for this purpose were apparently in fairlyclose touch with the F.B. I. They indicateto the F.B.I certain of their members whoare working in factories. These peopleare then employed as agents by the F.B.I.both on espionage and communist matters.The Americans were evidently impressedby what they had seen here and particular-ly by their visit to the P.M. Harry isarranging for them to be shown round oneof the .Branch factories.SKEELS has been given 2 years imprisonmentand VAUGHAN has been sent to a mentalhome.February 20thDoust called here today with copies ofThe Engineer. One of his people atDollis Hill had spotted an advertisementof Fischer Bearings. This seemed toshow or rather indicate thi some messagein code relating to the .A.F.experimentalstations was being communicated to theOenemy. It may turn out to be a mare'snext but on its face value it looksrather promising.We have got down Mills to join B.2a. Heis going to take over Stork who is moreor less a problem on his own.February 2lstI saw Philby this morning in order toCatalogufecreferenepkvr4liszbroad. He is working729on ways and means of disseminating propaga:ganda in occupied territories by word ofmouth, by chain letters and by mimographedleaflets. For this purpose he wants togo very deeply into the question of dis-guising handwriting and and disguisingthe origin or typewritten or mimographedletters. I got in Burt who gave someuseful information based on his C.I.D.experience.February 22nd-March 2ndOn leave.March 3rdWe had a meeting with Harry Allen in thechair on shipping leakage. Variousspheres of interest were defined asbetween B.Branch and D. 2. A smallcommittee has now been formed with Hartas secretary. There appears to be acertain division of opinion in theAdmiralty on the whole question. Somesay that as a convoy has to sail everytwo days and is dependant on the tidesthat the enemy are bound to find outwhere it is, if they can carry out theordinary aerial reconnaissance.There has been some news about Snow fromLisbon. He and Canary are by way ofreturning. The indications are thattheir visit has not been altogether asuccess although Snow tells us that heCataloghereference.kv4hspntract. Catalogue780David and Victor have peen down to afirm concerned in the manufacture of a newtype of Shote-electric shell. It shouldexplode if it comes within 150 ft. ofits target. There is I gather anothereven more important development in theshape of an RDF shell which containsboth a sending and receiving set.March 4thI lunched with Swinton today, in orderto discuss with him certain trouble thatwe have been having with Gen.Spears.Spears is of the opinion that we shouldeliminate all the supporters of Vichyfrom this country andfor some time he hasbeen tryi ing to get our support for amove of this kind. We had told him thatin the absence of any very specific evi-dence that Chartier and his entouragewere carrying out active operationsagainst de Gaulle in this country, itwas difficult for us to advocate a policyof internment or expulsion against thesupports of Vichy, particularly since itmight be assumed that H.M.G. were notanxious to offend them at this moment. Itmight I think well be argued that of thetwo Vichy is more likely ultimately tobe of use to us than de Gaulle. In thisparticular case Spears had forwarded cer-tain documents that he had received fromde Gaulle's forces. Kenneth Younger hadreplied giving an analysis of these teeu-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1871%0ments that he had received from de Gaulle'headquarters purporting to show that theVichy Consulate were trying to subornmembersod embersfde-Gauttehs de Gauttets forces. Kennethadrepliedgiving- an analysis-f thesedoouments and saying that if the facts inthem were found to be accurate somethingcertainly ought tobe done. He made twosuggestions (1) that the F.O. shouldask Chartier for an explanation and(2) that de Gaulle with his new powersshould place the consulate out of boundsto all his troops and deal with those whocontravened the order. For some unexplair-ed reason this letter drew a most mali-clous reply from Spears who made it theoccasion for a general attack on M. 1.5.He said that we might well be describedas "The Innocents at Home" and that ourmotto should be "Hear no evil, see no evilspeak no evil". He then went on to saythat we did not seem to have any conceptioof our duties. This would nat have beenSO bad had he confined his remarkspersonally to us. Instead he gave hisletter a very wide circulationincluding de Gaulle. We drafted acomplete answer to all the points in hisletter which we propose to send with acovering letter in which it is stated thathad Spears taken the trouble to make someenquiries a good many of his points couldhave been cleared up. We also remark thatit seems extremely unfortunate that acopy of his letter should have gone toGen. de Gaulle since it could only makeCatalogue Reference:KVI4/187787Younger's task more difficult than it isalready. We hope therefore that hewould see that our reply was given thesame circulation as his letter. D.S.S.did not feel that he could sign thisletter and had asked me to confer withSwinton about it. Swinton entirelyagreed with our reply and said that itwas a epartmental matter and should besigned by the D.S.S..Petrie to whom Ialso showd th documents at Swinton'srequest, agreed. I explained to Swintonwhat our difficulties had been withregard to the French, and admitted quitefrankly that we had not been satisfiedfor a long time, with ur French Section,owing to lack of experienced officers.We had been obliged to let the thing dragon until we could get Kenneth Youngerback. I explained that Kenneth wasdoing extremely well and that as far asI knew everybody with whom he came intocontact agreed that he was very efficientand a very pleasant person to deal ith.Spears had in fact expressed this viewhimself. It was therefore very extra-ordinary that he should have launchedthis sudden attack. Swinton agreed thatKenneth was a very efficient officer andvery much regretted what had happened.He evidently does not think much ofSpears' reliability. Swinton was verypleasant. He asked me if I liked Petrie.I replied that I liked hin very much andthat I thought that he was a verystraight person to deal with. SwintonCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187183agreed, and said that he thought he wasvery strong. I infer that Petrie is goingto take over.The sabotage case where gelignite wasplaced in an aircraft engine has progress-ed considerably. It now seems/inlikelythat several other machines from thesame squadron may have been treated in asimilar manner. It seems that therehave been a number of accidents the exactreason for which is not altogether clear.Tests have been carried out (a) to seewhether gelignite dipped in sea-water be-comes penetrated right through to thecore and (b) whether the particular pieceof gelignite has been So affected. Ithas been found that gelignite does becomepenetrated throughout by seatater andthat the piece found in the engine hadtraces of seawater through to the core.This I think proves conclusively that itwas placed in the engine before theaccident. It seems likely that the geligniwas obtained from a quarry near by wherecertain work was carried out by menof the same squadron to which the machinebelonged. This line has been closelyfollowed up and a list of names of thoseemployed on the fatigue party has beenobtained. Unfortunately theyear nowscattered about all over the country.Baron WERRA, the German arrman who was aP/W here, has again escaped in Canadaand succeeded in reaching the U.S.A. HeCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187264escaped twice in this country by diggihghimself out, and the second time he posedas a Polish airman. He succeeded inactually getting into a "Spitfire" andwas being shown the controls etc. whenhis identity was discovered. He washelped by the German consulate in U.P.A.but was eventually caught by the Americ inpolice. He has now I think jumped hisbale or parole. It is very importantthat he should not succeed in gettingback to his own country as he undoubtedlyhas a good deal of information which wouldbe useful.Hodgkin has replied about the FischerBearings advertisement in The Engineer.He can get no confirmation of the locallegend and thinks the advertisement isgenerally far-fetched and odd. We havenot yet had a reply from Gerald Wellesleyon the other aspects of the case.There is an interesting letter in theCensorship report about the Laval-Petainincident. It is dated 19.12.40 and isfrom Jose Laval in France to her brother-in-law Rene de Chambrun in New York. Inaccepting Laval's resignation Petain said"The country does not trust you, nor do I-because every time you come back fromParis I ask myself what unpleasantsurprise is in store for me". Lavalreplied: "I hope Sir that your successivecontradictory decisions wiyll do no harmto our country." Laval was intending toCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1877%55return to Paris but was arrested beforehis departure. He was only released onthe intervention of Abetz.S.I.S. report that Wendel Wilkie toldDev. that the U.S. considered that inpresent circumstances the Irish insistenceon the partition question was dispropor-tionate and hardly worthy of consideration. This remark appears to havecaused a deep impression on all thosepres nt who were careful not to takeupthe challenge. Wilkie laid great stresson British courage and powers of enduranceand said that he thought if they held outanother 5 months victory would be definite-ly assured. He triedto impress uponthe members of the Eire Govt. that theirpresent neutrality policy was unreasonableand a false position from the Americanstandpoint.March 5thSpears is now trying to say that hisletter attacking M.I.5 was only sent tothe F.F.F. by mistake and that, he re-covered it without its being read bythe latter. We had previously been toldfirstly by Archdale that it had been sentto the F.F.F. but in order to make doublysure Kenneth spoke to Somerville and saidthat as we were replying to the letter weshould like to know officially from himwhether it had reached de Gaulle. Somer-ville replied that he had been sent tode Gaulle and that he had informed SpearsCatalogue of Reference.k4/187 this fact and that he had acquainted us78with the position. It seems not unlikelythat Spears is now trying to lie himselfout of a rather awkward situation. Inthe meantime I understand that Mortonhas been taking steps to get the letterwithdrawn. Spears' story is that it hasonly been sent to ourselves and Mack ofthe F.0. and to Lord Bessborough. Mortonis extremely annoyec about the wholething.Directors meeting this morning. I raisedthe question of this new organisationwhich Duthy is setting up to deal withseamens hostels abroad and counterattractions for British and al ied seamen,who the Germans were attempting to subern.It seemed to me thatDuthy was going verymuch outside his province and might beinclined to take action on informationthat had not been properly sifted andcollated here. I'm going into thismatter further. I also raised the Ques-tion of some place of honourable detentionThis had been brought to a head by therefusal of a number of Balkan diplomatsto teturn to their own country. It wasobviously undesirable that some of theRoumanians should be left wandering aboutthe country. The alternatives seem tobe either a castle in the country orD. R. 18a or the Aliens Order Section 11.It was thought advisable that we shouldtake this matter up with Swinton.I asked what was being done to implementthe decision about handing over to .BranchCatalogerkeferenceckv4/8z the registry. I said787that if we were going to do the extractingand direction for carding we should needcertain Registry personnel. As I under-stood the Review Section were regardedas redundant, would those employed inthis section now be transferred to theappropriate sections of B? I said thatdid not think these sections would beable to carry this work with theirexisting staff and that it was alsonecessary that somebody should remainin the registry with whom one sectionscould establish contact in order that theymight get the advice they needed about thefiling sy stem.Gambia Parry has taken over R.S.S.Ivery much hope that things may now getgoing. It will be necessary to see thatour interests are safeguarded and that thewhole of the energies of the orginisa-tion are not devoted to ISOS messages.Lennox came in this afternoon and gave mesome kind of picture of what is going on.I gather that the abandonment of theisland of Castellorizo in the Dodecanesewas due to the misreading of a signal.The P.M. was evidently furious but noattempt is to be made to retake theisland at the moment. The parachuteincident in Siily may have been a partialsuccess but nothing is really known.Most of the people have been rounded upbut there are I believe half a dozenunaccounted for. The original partyCatalogue Reference:KVI4/187788consisted of of between 30 and 40. Therewas one serious blot. One of the planeshad engine trouble and sent out a signalin a very simple cypher to Malta say ingthat it was going to land as near thesubmarine base as possible. When Dud leyPound heard this he refused to allowthe submarine to go to the rendezvous.It may be that certain acts of sabotagehave been carried out as there is anunconfirmed report that communication withBrindisi has been cut and that the watersupply there is deficient.Eden's visit was for the purpose ofinspiring confidence in the Greeks whoare short of ammunition and equipmentand threatening to come to terms withthe Italians. He has promised them atleast two Army Corps, which are now ontheir way. The Turks state they willcometo their support if they are ttackedor severely threatened.A signal has just been received fromthe Naval Officer commanding the NavalExpedition to the Lofoten Islands. thecodliver oil factories have been complete-ly destroyed and a certain number ofGerman prisoners have been taken, and twoor three hundred civilians who wish tojoin the Norwegian Forces in this country.The expedition has been a completesuccess and no losses have been incurred.We have apparently lost a destroyer atBardia but we have torpedoed the ItalianCatalogueReterercekvi4frsznd also a fairly large769Italian transport. The Suex Canal hasbeen more or less blocked since the 15thFeb. owing to raids by the Germans fromthe Dodecanese. It had been cleared oncebut a further raid 2 days ago had causedanother stoppage.The diverting of 4 ships carrying iron orefrom the Swedish mines has been anothersuccessful enterprise. I gather thatby bribery or other means these shipswere induced to sail to England insteadof to Bremen. The Germans did not becomeaware of what was afoot until after theships had got through the Kattegatt. Theysent a small force up the western coast ofDenmark to intercept t nem but they weretoo late. A British convoy of warshipspicked them up and brought them safelyinto port. They carried nearly twomonths supply from the Swedish mines.Jolly good show.There has been a case of sabotage on the"Queen Elizabeth" which will put her outof action for 2-3 months. It is dueto certain small implements which musthave bee put into the machinery, a longishtime ago. They got mixed up with theturbines.March 6thThere is a report of sabotage in a factoryat Ruislip which is working on the produc-tion of Oerlikon guns. These guns areto be mounted on merchant ships and areCatalogue Reference:KV/4/18779oextremely effectve against enemy air-craft. They should provide the necessaryanswer to a good many of the sinkings.Ernest WOOLLEY, the Communist, had alreadycaused a good deal of trouble and hadbeen dismissed. Some 50 or 60 people hadcome out in sympathy but had eventuallybeen allowed to return. It was immediate-Oly after their return that the act asabotage took place.A small ketch has been picked up off theCanaries. The indications are that itis one of those being sent out by theGerman S.S. from France to report onthe movements of shipping. Its name issimilar to another boat which is known tobe doing this work.March 7thCare,I saw Carpew.It has at last beenarranged that he may join us as we havebeen given an increase in militaryestablishment.I also saw Derbyshire I told him thatfor a long time I had not been satisfiedwith his work in B.4b. It seemed to methat he had never got any real grip onthe subject. Equally I was not pleasedwith the way he had beenpresenting cases.I explained to him that the case of LadyHOWARD was extremely untidy when itreached me and that I had to get Hart toput it in some form which could beCatalogue Reference:kV/4/1877911presented to the Home Office. He seemedvery astonished and somewhat hurt thathis work had not been considered satis-factory. He wanted to continue dealingwith Russian affairs and suggested thathe might perhaps join up with Pilkington.I said that I wanted him to come up and dothe Poles with Alley and that I thoughtit was necessary that he should dighimself well into that andonotrbringany other work with him which woulddivert his attention. He expressed hiswillingness to do anything that Ithought was necessary, but he wasclearly rather distressed by the factthat he had not been altogether asuccess.Petrie has been officially appointedD.S.S. and is to come in on Monday.The Navy are very worried about anAmerican journalist FRAZER and hisCanadian colleague LAKE. They do not wisheither of them to return as they havevery intimate knowledge about the tranport convoy which brought them to thiscountry from Canada. This is going tocreate rather an awkward situation.Ihave asked Ramsbotham to explore the groursince the boat they came over on isDutch with a mainly Dutch crew. If thisis going back to America it seems justas likely that the news will leakthrough a member of the crew as throughFRAZER or LAKE who both seem well disposedtowardsCatalogue "Reference:KV/4/18715The Norwegians who were taken off theLofoten Islands are all being sent toLondon and are to be housed in hotelsinstead of going to the Patriotic Schools.This business was all rushed throughwithout reference to us.

There are about a dozenQuislings who will be interned under12(5)A.March thS.I.S. are in a great state about thepublication of a book called The Diaryof a Staff Officer, who in addition tocriticisingeth French and BritishCommands in rather an outspoken mannermakes reference to work affecting theG.C.& C.S. I communicated first withMr. Ray of Methuens, the publishers, andthen with Dick's brother who is a partnerin the firm. 1,900 copies have alreadybeen issued and since further demandsare being made by the booksellers, mostof them must be in the hands of privateindividuals. Meanwhile another 7,000copies are in preparation and are to goout on Tuesday next. Dick's brother tellsme that the book was submitted to the M.0.]and passed by all 5 Service representativesbefore Xmas. It was then publishedserially in the U.S. A. It is possiblehowever that the offending passages mayCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187793have been omitted. A few copies havegone to Canada and the bock has beenextensively reviewed here in the Press.I am suggesting that the 7,000 copiesshould not be circulated and that theCensorship and D.4 should be warnedagainst letting any of them out of thecountry. I feel that if we do morethan this we shall only be drawingattention to what we are anxious todonceal. We shall be in a betterposition to decide on Monday.The alleged sabotage case at the Oerlikonfactory looks like a mare's nest. Itseems not unlikely that the manager is try-ing to cover up bad workmanship byalleging that an act of sabotage hasbeen committed. The damaged parts donot indicate that they have been struckby a hammer and the dents are similarto those on a good many other unfinishedproducts. They might have been causedby the breach blocks having been droppedon the ground. The general state ofthe factory by no means renders thistheory improbable. I have warned theAdmiralty who have been moving heavenand earth to get all the alleged commun-ists in the factory put in jail.I dined with Arthur Pollen. There wasa heavy raid going on, the first seriousone we have had for a long time. Severalbombs dropped near Onslow Gardens inclu-ding one I believe on or near GloucesterCatalogire Refereare:KV/4/187794The Cafe de Paris was hit, and anotherone came down in Sloane St. opposite thepremises of the London ShoeCo.I understand that Eden's mission to theBalkans is for the purpose of putting heartinto the Greeks who were on the verge ofbreaking about Turkish up, andalso intentions. to get It some seems assurance fairlycertain that the Turks will fight, atany rate if their own possessions aret reatened. Wavell hassaid that he isreasonably certain of being able to holdthe Greek Peninsula. Strenuous effortsare being made by Eden to see the Regentand to induce Yugo-Slavia to come in atthe back of the Italians in Albania. Thiswould certainly be a master-stroke ifit could be pulled off. On the otherhand the Yugo-Slavs have an enormousfrontier to hold and arepracticallysurrounded by German troops. speed ishowever the important factor since theGermans have not massed in any numbersexcept in Bulgaria. Both their lines ofcommunication and those of the Italianswould be seriously threatened if the Yugo-slavs acout act effectively.Weygand's attitude is still uncertain.De Gaulle has now sent him a telegramsuggesting that the hatchet should beburied and that he should weigh in in theinterests of France. It looks as if theAmericans are going to make a move sooneror later. Something in the nature ofstaff talks about seapane bases at London-Catalogue Reference:KV/4/187795derry are going on. There are to be atleast 35 American bombing seaplanesstationed there which will be for thepurpose of protecting our convoys.Preparations are now going on. This isabout the most cheering news that I haveheard lately.March 9thWe have obtained through our, Jap contacta copy of the P.M. 's reply to Matsuoka ofthe 24th Feb. It is fairly stronglyworded and concludes with the remarkthat it would be a matter of profoundestregret to H.M.G. if by any circumstancesJapan and this country were to becomeembroiled and this not only becuase oftheir recollection OI the years duringwhich the two countries were happilyunited in alliance but also because sucha melancholy event would both spread andprolong the war without however in theopinion of H.M.G. altering its conclusion.The figures for release from internmer'on 8.3.41 were: Germand and Austrians11,620, Italians ,211.March l0thI saw Stewart and Hopkinson about theofficer's diary. We discussed the problemin all its aspects and thought that beforecoming to a definite conclusion it wouldbe wise to see Gribble at the earliestCatalogaeRefefence.v4/187796Stewart told me that there were indica-tions that the Germans might be makingsome sort of a move between 13th-15thHe thought that if anything happened itwould be more likely to be in the natureof a raid than a serious invasion.His sources showed that the Germanswere intending to make a drive down tothe Bosphorus and to go right throughTurkey to the oil wells.Spent the night with Charles.March llthStewart, Lennox and I saw Gribble atthe W.O. He admitted that he knw themessages came from a very secret sourcebut he thought that he was amply coveredby having submitted his diary for censor-ship. He admitted however that he hudshown the document previously to his agentin order to see whether its contents werelike to interest the public if they werepublished in book form. It was explainedto him that certain passages constituteda grave indiscretion and that it was inthe public interest that he should CO-operate with us in doing anything possibleto pick up the pieces. We eventuallyagreed that even though the offendingpassages had appeared in the SaturdayEvening Post it would be better to issuethe new edition in amended form. Gribblewas to tell his agent that he wished tomake certain amendments in the text andtherefore that he would like the returnCatalogue Reference:kV/4/1871a7of the proof copy from America beforeany further action is taken. As regardsthe Manchester Evening News who were ask-ing permission to publish the book inserial form, it was decided to see firstwhether they were proposing by their ownselection to exclude the offendingpassages. If not, we should have to saythat the book could not be publishedserially until certain amendments hadbeen made which the author considereddesirable in the light of subsequentinformation received.I lunched afterwards with Stewart. Hetold me that his own sources had reportedmost accurately almost every move inthe Balkans and that all his informationhad been confirmed in a most remarkableway by E,J. I gather that furtherprogress has been made by F.J. in thenaval sphere. Information had beenreceived that the Italians were likelyto abandon Massawa very shortly. Therendezvous for their ships is known andthe Navy ought to have a good chanceof getting at them.S.0.2 have been giving a great deal oftrouble. They act in a very slipshod andindiscreet manner. The result is that alltheir people get rounded up and some ofStewart's as well. This I gather is whathas been happending in the Balkans. Inthe afternnon Dick's brother came down andwe discussed details about Gribble's book.It was apparent that if the offendingpage was taken out it would be quite clearCatalogue Reference:KVI4/187798that a new one had been gummed in. Wetherefore decided to buy up the whole ofthe second edition which VBS alreadybound and have arranged that the offendingpage in the other two editions should beremoved altogether, with those which werejoined to it.

We came to the conclusionthat B.4c, working on Soviet espionagewould have to remain in the subversiveblock but would have to be controlledby the espionage block, that D.C shouldbe under one head in the Aliens block butshould remain in close contact with usfor the supply of camp intelligence, thatB.10, B.16, .29 and B.H. houldall bein the Espionage block, that the examinersin B. 24 should be under the direction ofthe Espionage block ind the laguagesections in the Aliens Block. 1 added anote in our recommendations about C.&.It seemed to me that there was a te denyto transfer the activities of C.S. to theSecretariat.

This isa very deli-cate and difficult matter. 1 said that Ithought it was important to consider howfar each ofrour people is SO minded thathe would be quite ready to assist theenemy, and to distinguish between thisclass and those who are in possession ofimportant information and might besubject to pressure.The following statement by a Lieutenantof the Marine Artillery captured fromthe Lofoten Islands is interesting"I come from Norway, from the LofotenIslands, and was taken prisoner onTuesday morning.

He says tha t the Germansare very clever about their Pass systeThey are constantly changing theirregulations. It is therefore very diffi-cult to provide an agent with the prerdocuments. He thought that we should dowell to consider this since he was certainthat if did something on the lines ofchanging the colour of the RegistrationCards we should seriously embarrass theGermans here and their employers abroad.I mean to take this matter up withSylvanus, who may have some good ideas.March l6thSpent most of today visiting G.P. in thecountry.

Theyrelate to the location of factories,shortage of materials, establishment ofsubmarine bases in N. Ireland etc.I discussed with D.G. the question ofthe Centre He is forwarding Hollis'smemo and pointing out that it is obviouslywrong that the Centre should collatea great deal of material without thenecessary background. Such materialshould properly be collated here. He wasquite emphatic about this.We have had our first case with enyrappearance of reality of signalling to theenemy by means of an electric torch.One Fredk. George Percy AVERY who livesnear Southampton is coming for trial atCatalogues RefefhicetRe/4isaize and is charged$0under a section of D.R. which renders himliable to 14 years imprisonment. Thereare 3 witnesses who say that he wasflashing his torch during an air raidon both sides of his house. Avery'sdefence is that when he heard the aero-planes he went into his house to openthewindows to pevent them from breakingwith blast. Finding that his blackoutwas not p operly djusted, he used hiselectric torch in stead of turning onthe light. Personally I think he willget away with it.March l8thI spent the whole morning at a meeting withG.,Harker, Butler, Hollis, Stamp andHorrocks, on registry questions. Horrocksproposed that in future all papers shouldbe sent first to the registry to join upto their files. His complaint is thatan immense amount of time is wasted intrying to join up p.a. papers and thatthis work might just as well be done inthe first instance. He also contends,and D.G. agrees with him, that there arevery few papers which can be dealt withwithout the files. I said that speakingfor myself I killed a large number ofpapers stone dead without ever wishing tosee a file and that I thought that thisapplied to a number of other people. Thenew system would obviously necessitate theeransibing of a large number of fileswhich were not really required. H look-up will be done on the principal name andCatalogue Reference:KVI4/187any other name of importance. If fur-ther look-up is required the file willhave to go back to the registry. Igave as an illustration a case of areport which might come in about thecase of John Smith which might mentionthat he is associated with General Fullerand Raven Thompson. It was obviouslyunnecessary to send up the files forFuller and Raven Thompson, which mighbe required by some other sectionwhich was dealing with them from anotherangle. D. G. did not seem to think thatthis was a vlid argument, because theremight be officers who did not know aboutFuller and Raven Thompson. I said I thouthought this was rather remote since ifJohn Smith were associated with thesepeople he was probably a Fascist andhis papers would be in the hands ofB.7 all of whom would undoubtedly knowabout ruller and Raven Thompson. Howeverit seemed quite clear that D.G. wantedthe system tried out, even though Hollispointed out that the average time for ajoin-up in the case of 47 papers whichhad recently passed through hishands was 14 days, the longest timebeing 28 days. After the meeting Victorraised the question of sabotage caseswhere time was really the most importantfactor. If his papers were goingstraight to the registry to be joinedup and he knew nothing about them tilla fortnight later, it would be impossiblto carry on. However, we shall see howCatalogubtreferereekivi4fsroesnt, Catalogue doesnt, as the case maybe.go&Section officers are in future to indi-cate what carding is to be done andwhat extractingshould be carried out.I said that I thought that this wouldnecessitate somebody with a certain amountof registry experience attached to eachsection to see that all these variousduties were properly carried out. Evenif the indication were given by theofficer it was necessary for somebodyto check them before the files werepassed out. D.G. did not seem to thinkthat this would be necessary or that avery heavy burden would be placed on theofficers who he argued were obviousbetter qualified to mark for extractingor carding than nybody/in the Registry.While I see the force of this argument itis quite obvious that the efficacy of thisprocedure will depend very largely onthe knowledge and intelligence of theofficer who will have to be closelysupervised by his head of section.We then went on to discuss whether anygeneral directive could be given as towhat documents should be carded. Horrockshad a large bundle of papers dealingwith a whole variety of subjects andseemed generally of the opinion that thenames of people who were active abroadwere not our concern and need not there-fore be carded. We could often, hethought, rely upon S.I.S. records. Aparticular Case in point was a long listwith descriptions and photographs ofcommunists in Palestine. I said that Ithought all these names should be cardedCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187cor(a) because we had to keep Palestineinformed if we heard anything about theseindividuals and (b) because after thewar or even during the war they mightcome here or go to other parts of theEmpire. If we allowed a gap to occurin our records during the war periodwe should be in a very serious positionafter the war when communism would bea far more formidable problem than itwas after the last war. D.G. said ththat in his experience he did not thinkthat lists of this sort should be cardedbut that he would give the matterfurther consideration. He suggested asa compromise that we should write toPalestine and ask them to indicate themore important communists on the list.I said th that t I doubted whether this wouldbe adequate since it was not always themost important communist who travelled.I have kept Horrock' bundle of papersand am going to examine them.I lunched with V.V. and talked with himabout our morning's discussion on theregistry. He entirely agreed withmy point of view and thought it wouldbe disastrous if we did not card fairlyextensively. The lists of communistsin Palestine he thought should undoubted-ly be carded. His view was that we mustbe regarded as a world-collating centre.therwise we should be in difficulties.It was he thought impossible for us torely on S.I.S. They could not possiblyundertake to pass the names of allCatalogue atalogueReference!Ro4/i87wer interested over&(dtheir records, and the delay would inany case be toogreat. After lunch Idiscussed with V.V. and Cowgill thequestion of Hooper, who is working withVan t'Sant. It seems that there hasbeen some inter-office intrigue withDancey employing an agent to watch him.He is apparently associating with aMrs. Tregenna who is of foreign extrac-tion. I do not think there is anythingin it except sex.We are going to makefurther enquiries.Victor has an interesting example onthecarding question. It was suggested thatwe should not card intelligence reportsfrom the Middle East. - He has a caseofsabotage in Greece which is being runby a German agent called MEISNER. Onlooking-up MEISNER we found a MiddleEast report showing that he was formerlyassociated with a man called DOUBLEDAYin London. Enquiries are now beingmade about DOUBLEDAY. If MEISNER'S namehad not been carded in the Middle EastIntelligence rport we should not haveknown about DOUBLEDAY. It is obviousthat we ought to take every opportunityof carding German agents wherever theymay be since they will more than likelybe active when the war is over. Theyare now working above ground and thisis an opportunity to get their nameson record which will not occur when thewar is over.Catalogue Reference:KVI4/187March 19thBRISCOE and HISCOX have been remandedand have been charged preliminarilyunder Section 2(a)l of D.R. and alsounder the Treachery Act. All the papersare being sent to the D.P.P. who willdecide on the final charges.March 20thI saw Philby this morning. Burt ex-plained to him the result ofhis conversa-tion with Gurrin the handwriting expert.Gurrin says that he would be much moreconfident about identifying a typewriterwhich had been used to type certaindocuments than he would be in identifyinghandwriting. He says that almost everytypewriter has idiosynerasies of onekind or another after it has been in usefor a short time, and that most of themhave some distinguishing feature evenwhen they are new. He does not thinkthat it would be possible to alter thesecharacteristics on the typewriter betweenthe typing of each document withouta great dea of labour and mechanicalknowledgeI had a discussion With Felix aboutcarding hisdocuments. He suggests thata possible solution might be a CentralIndex to which ourselves, S.I.S., the5 fighting services, the F.0.,M.E.W.and Scotland Yard shouldall contribute.The cards would merely give a man'sname and indicate the department orCatalogue Reference:KV/4/1872,departments which had records. He thoughtthat the only person to run such an Indexwould be the Registrar General. If suchan Index were in existence S.I.S. andourselves would only have to card our ownmaterial. It would also obviate thenecessity of writing round to departmentsto know whether they had any information.V.V. pointed out that in order to startsuch an index it would be necessary for usall to duplicate our cards. Otherwiseit could not be regarded in any way asbeing comprehensive for a humber of years.This is I think the real snag. I havebeen through Horrocks's list of documentswhich he thinks should not be carded.While a certain amount of discriminationis possible, I think it is essentialthat we should be able to get at theserecords by onemeans or another. If wedo not card them it means that we have torefer all our look-ups to S.I.S. Thepresent practice is only to refer L.Usto S.I.S. where wefeel there is a verydefinite chance of their having a recordwhich they have not passed on to us.V.V. tells me that he does not send useverything but only such documents as hebhinks have a real bearing on our workI have arranged for a meeting bet'neenV. .V.,Felix, Dick and myself for Tuesdaynext, when I hope we may be able tothrash this out.Catalogue Reference:KV/4/1876i3Enquiry shows that in the BRISCOE casewe were consulted by the Ministry ofSupply about this woman's employmenton 31.1.41 but that they had alreadytaken her on on 20.1.41. We replied thatshe had German and Fascist associationsand we did not think her appointment wasdesirable. This case should be a lessonto otherdepartments.March 2lstTheo Turner and I spoke to D.6. thismorning about the release of enemy aliens.The position has now become rather farci-cal. In addition to the M.A.B. comb-outwhen a lot of so-called experts weredrafted into aircraft factories, and alsoto the comb-out by the Ministry of Agri-culture and the A.M.P.C., a further comb-out is suggested by the Asquith Committee.The object is to obtain the services ofevery able-bodied alien whether enemy ornot, and to draft him into some usefulemployment. Only those against whom wereally have a cast-iron case are to bekept inside. The question was whetherwe should let this go by default orwhether we should sound some warningnote. Those who are working for generalrelease argue that no serious act ofsabotage has been committed by any ofthose who have been released. The otherside of the picture is that we have comeacross from time to time individualsboth British and alien who in the eventCatalogue Referencekvfrisyoul certainly come814down on the German side of the fence.We also have the results of our investi-gation into the mentality of those ininternment camps. The general view isthat their loyalty to this country varieswith the morning paper. If things aregoing well, they are pro-British, if badly-fore pro-German a considerable or pro-Italian. risk that There in time is thereof invasion a certain proportion of theenemy alien population might be thecause of serious embarrassment. D.G.thinks that we should represent thisaspect fairly forcibly. He talked to meaboutthe case of BELLI. He has verydefinite views about the Italian Fascioand thinks that the Advisory Committeehave skated very lightly over the interro-gation. In his view the man should havebeen kept inside.We have just captured KRECHMAR, the Germanace submarine commander. A member of hiscrew says that the other submarine acePRIEN is some 8 weeks overdue and it isthought that his submarine has been sunk.An extensive raid on the coast of Francewhich was to have taken place on thenight of the 19th-20th was called off atthe last moment by the P.M.

There seemsto be some idea of taking the Dodecanesebut not until next month.March 22ndThere has been some rather disquietingnews about Snow. It seems that theGermans were not satisfied with his traf-fic and went for him. He evidently felthimself cornered and admitted that hehad been operating under duress. Inspite of this he alleges that he hasbeen given a sum of El0, 000 and a newcontract. This seems very curious butthere is no chance of getting at thefacts until he returns. We are expectinghim back next week. In the meantimeCelery is apparently his on way back bysea. Snow has suggested that he arousedsuspicion through obtaining a passageCatalogue Reference.kv4/ioy aeroplane.Iamdis-cr6inclined to believe this as he had verygood commercial reasons for travelling.There is also the rather curious fact thatat one moment he said he was ill andwanted his wife and child to join himin Lisbon.It may be thit he has losthis nerve.The whole thing is ratherunfortunate but it was bound tocome toan end sooner or later. We shall have toget other strings to our bow.There is rather reassuring news aboutTricycle (Skoot). He isto come here ona special mission instead of going toAmerica. It is possible that he isrequired here in order that he can takeSnow's place and that this is why a changehas been made.Dick and I had a talk with D.G. aboutthe organisation. He now inclines to theview that Curry should control both thesubversive and aliens block If this isdone we go back to exactly where westarted. D.G. has asked us to work outthe details, I am not quite sure ifthis is what Curry wants and I shalldiscuss it with him on Monday.I was rung up by the night duty officerwho had received a report from the P.M.Ssecretary that aerial photographs takenat Chequers revealed some kind of suspici-ous ground signalling. I have arrangedfor Con to go down to Chequers in themorning. I seem to remember that we hada similar incident at the beginning ofCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187the war, when it was suggested that thethe ground had been ploughed up in apeculiar way. The whole thing turnedout to be a mare's nest.March 23rdGroup messages have indicated that a womannamed the Countess de JONGHE, nee SAVITSCHwas possibly a German agent. The GernS.S. were in touch with her and interestedin getting hold of her passport. Shesubsequently applied for a visa in Lisbonand although the application showed that Sshe had received a Spanish transit visaat the request of the German authorities heher application was granted. Herhusband, the Vicombe de Jonghe, a Belgiansubject, is at present employed by S.0.2and has apparently been communicatingwith his wife in Lisbon through theBelgian bag. The Vicomte is consideredto be all right although he has somecurious connections. He joined theBelgian Army on the l0th May and somehowmanaged toget over here. He has had avery adventurous career according tohis own account. He married the comtessede JONGHE by proxy after living with herfor four years. Fortunately Harris knowsde Jonghe fairly intimately and may beable to get some line on the wife. Inthe meantime we have issued instructionsthat if she arrives she ig to be broughtto Nightingale Rd. where she will beexamined on the strength of her Spanishtransit visa. It is just possible thatCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187t61&she has played up to the Germans in orderto get an exit visa to visit her husbandbut on the whole this does not seem verylikely. It is difficult to make anydecision about the hanaling ofher Caseuntil she actually arrives. We shallbe in better position to mike up ourminds when we havesearcned her baggageand heard what she has to say for herself.Her husband is an extremely talkitiveperson and will undoustedly tell hiswife everything that he is doing. therewill then be the dinger of the informationgoing out through the belgian D g.-ORIGINAL THIS DOCUMENT IS A COPYACT 3 DEPARTMENT (4) 19580 OF THE PUBLIC UNDER RECORDS RETAINED SECTIONMarch 24thO58GpLEECOROSI had a further discussion with the D.G.and Harker on organisation. I again putforward the suggestion that it would bebetter to have an aliens control sectionunder Theo Turner and an Aliens sectionfor investigation matters under Kenneth,and grouped under Curry. D.4. thinksthat the interests of the espionage blockwould be thorougnly safeguarded if Currywas in control of both the subversive andaliens investigation. This means thatwe have really made the full circle andcome back to exactly where we started.Catalogue Reference.kVi4/18The whole reorganisation scheme is purelyciaa paper transaction.

In this respect very littlechange seems to be possible and there wilundoubtealy be a certain number of oursections in the country who in emergencywill look to Curry for guidance, and acertain number of Curry's sections intown who will in emergency look to Dickfor guidance. This is in fact what isgoing on now.M. and Gillson came to see me about HERON.He has produced some interesting informa-tion about Alexis HOCHBERG, the youngerbrother of Prince Henry of Pless, who isinterned. For some reason the GermanGovt. wish HOCHBERG to sell his propertyrights in Poland to his brother for thesum of 5 million dollars. The exact purposeis not Clear but it may be that the Ger nswish to give some air of regularity tothe proceedings in order not to ofIendlocal public opinion. The transactionhas been carried out through a bank inSwitzerland and the deal was to be condlu-ded in Lisbon. Heron is obviously anxiousthat the transaction willso through as hewill get a large rake-off. y He wants ourassistance in facilitating the exit fromhere of Mrs. de HAVILLAAND Who will have aCatalogue Cataloguebbeferenge Power bBeferenge of Attorney to complete going the to deal be in thekind of basis on which we shall be expected$20to work with Heron. In actual fact Heronin this case is telling us nothing that wedid not know before. Hart, who has beendoing the case of Prince Henry ofPless,has the full facts. Heron has producedanother story about CUNNINGHAME who wasarrested on our information a short timeago for a confidence trick. His metierwas to steal suitcases. He had disclosedto the police that he had found in a suit-case a document, the property of W.J.Hooper. This document was relating to Dov-iet espionage. When questioned by M.CUNNINGHAME said that he had taken no copyof the document. Heron who has been askedto act for him in his appeal, now says thathe did take a copy. M. wants to know ifin the event of this copy being handed overCUNNINGHAME will get a remission of sentenceI have said that the first thing is forus to see the document. In actual factI do not see how this disclosure willbenefit CUNNINGHAME in any way. The inci-dent does show however that Heron is abletoget useful information. Although thereis obviously going to be a quid pro quoin each case. What I think he really wantsto do is to legalise some of his moredubious dealings with the underworld.March 25thI had a rather satisfactory talk withHorrocks about the carding of documentsI told him that I had been through hisbundle of documents and that while U donot think every name Should be carded ICatalogue Reference:KV/4/187uudid not think there were many which wecould ignore. They either had a short ora long term interest. It was thereforeessential that somehow we should be able toget at the records. It seemed to me that iiwe had no central index we would be forcedeither to card them ourselves or to relyentirely on S.I.S. If we relied on .I.S.it meant that we shhould have to pass allour look-ups over their records. Atpresent we only did this when there wasany special indication that they might knowsomething about the individual in question.HorrockS seemed taken with the idea ofsomething in the nature of a CentralIndex and even suggested that we mightget our foreign links to send duplicatecards when submitting their reports. Thegreat difficulty of course is in startingthe index, since only by duplicating allexisting cards should bve be able to beproperly covered. We are going to haveanotaer meeting next Tuesday.Direcbors meeting this morning at whichvarious problems fr the Executive Ctteewerediscussed. These included thedistribution of leaflets within a pro-tected place and the reception of refu-gees from Ireland in the event of invasion.As regards the latter problem the positionis still not very clear. They are to beollected by the military and taken underguard to an approved port where presumablythey will have to be interrogateo Noarrangement for this interrogation appearCatalogue Reference:KV/47187to have peen own view is they822should be sorted out by the local S.C.O.and that those who were unsatisfactoryshould be sent to the Patriotic Schools ifthis is feasible in the circumstances.D.G. held a meeting in the afternoon aboutW. He went through our previous memoandseemed satisfied with the arrangementsthat had been made to effect a better liai-son with the Censorship. He thought itwould be a good thing to have afurtherdiscussion with Harry about theSecurityside of the work of W.3.March 26thI attended a meeting with Sir Harold Satowto discuss the request of the Swissatthorities that they might be furnishedwith details about certain Germans aboutwhom the German authoritis were makingenquiries. The Germans had sent them apro forma which they wanted the individualto fill in personally. It is a littledifficult in some ways to see the necessityfor this since any German who wished tocommunicate with his relatives could do Soeither through the Swiss Legation or throughthe Red Cross. Sir HarodSatow said thatthe Germans had a very large number of ourpeople interned and that it was becoming dif-ficult to get information about them asthe German auth rities were claiming thatwe would n t give them reciprocal treatment.It waseventually agreed (1) that the messageshould be of a purely personal kind (2) thatit should be subject to censorsnip and (3)Catalogue Reference:KV/4/187that no address should be given. so farabout 200 pro formas had been received.Special arrangements would have to be madebetween ourselves,S.I.S. and S.0.2 in orderthat their interests should be safeguarded.It is possible that the Germans might beenquiring about somebody in whom theywere interested. In such an eventualitythey would of course like to know. It willof course always be open to us to refuseto allow a communication to go through,and there should be sufficient cover toprevent the Germans from reaching any con-clusions by process of elimination. Itis quite normal for the P/W Dept. to replythat an individual does not wish to commun-icate or is untraceable. The presentarrangement may be subject to revision whenwe get a better idea of what the Germansare driving at through the examination oftheir lists.David tells me thit D. 1. now have ,900 fact-tories to visit. There are only 10officers. Allowing for a certain amountof time at headquarters this would meana visit about once every two years.There are still a large number of factorieswhich have never been visited at ail. Itseems to me that if this job is worth doingat all, each of the .Sections shouldhave at least twenty men. 1 had alwaysanticipated before the war that there wouldbe such an extension. I still feel thatthey could profitably have an officerattached to each R.S.L.O He would beCatalogue Reference:Ki4/18great deal of the lessimportant work.624Spooner came to see me about the tracingof certain booklets published by the W.O.on the German military organisation. Thesebooklets have been found in the packing ofbottles of hair wash and had been handedover by the firm to the police in Wales.It transpires that there is a firm wherea great deal of confidential waste paperis sent by the W.O. and B.B.C. Both thesedepts. rely on the firm to sort out themore confidential matter for pulping. Theremainder appears to be used for packing.I have asked Spooner to make a full reporton this. It is really rather absurd thatwe should be trying to get people to keepconfidential documents in safe places whenthe W.O. sent them out to be used forpacking bottles of hair wash.March 27thI visited Fighter Command and was taken overby W/C Coope and F/L Spencer. I also hada talk with Air Vice Marshal Evill. Iexplained to him more or less what ourinterest was in getting information aboutoperations by German planes over thiscountry,particularly at night. Victor alsotalked to him about sabotage. I asked himwhy it was that there had been no bombingfor about 6 consecutive nights. He said ththey had recently made a survey of Germanair activity over this country for a periodof months. They had come toy the conclusionthat the Germns had attacked whenever theyreasonably could. They had however beenCatalogue severely Reference:KVi4/187 hampered by eather conditions.He said that there had been no real testfor air supremacy since last September.The Messerschmidt 109 had been very maahimproved since then. This accounted forthe German prisoners being more conidentabout its performance. It was not nowpossible for a Hurric to get ner ir it,but improvements were constantly beingmade and the Air vice Marshal thougnt weshould beable to give a very good accotof ourselves. The pitfire was certainlya match for the 109 as far is we could tell.I gather that both the spitfires indHurricanes were being hotted up. He toldme that in August and september the battlein the air had been arried out by onegroup almost single-handed. This had beendone for tactical reasons as it was fearedthat the Germans might try and draw planesfrom other sectors of the coast ind thenmake an attack from a different direction.It seems also that the Group concerned wasanxious to carry the whole burden of theday on its own shoulders and it becamealmost a point of honour with them not tocall on any of the other groups.After looking at a number of maps and docu-ments we went down to the filter room. Thepurpose of this room is to record graphi-cally the position of our aircraft andenemy aircraft and to establish theiridentity which is not always a simplematter. When this has been'done, theinformation is passed direct to the Groupsin all parts of England and to the Opera-Cataloguerefeferce:icw4ri8?ommind H gommind Headquarters.s26The filter room, which is situated wellunderground, is semi-circular, and containa map of the whole of the U.K. and IrishSea. There are girls sitting all roundit with counters of different sizes andcolours in boxes in front of them. Theyeach cover an arc which overlaps with theone next it. These arcs represent therange of the R.D.F. station on the coastwith which they are in direct communica-tion by headphone. As the planes arereported they put the appropriate counteron the table. It sometimes happens thatthe R.D.F. station is not certain whetherthe plane is British or enemy. The variousofficers concerned then get into touchwith the local Group commanders, eithercoastal or Fleet hirArm, or civil, in orderto find out whether they have any planes upin the vicinity. In this way it isgenerally possible to identify the plane.As soon as this is done a swastika or a circle is flashed down by a spot light fromthe ceiling. There is a gallery in thisroom where WAAFS and NCOs in the Air Forcewearing headphones are reporting directto groups and to the control room theposition of each of our planes and theenemy's as they are recorded on the mapbelow them. They do not report untilthe identity of the plane is established.There are various other maps of thecountry lit up by electricity and showingthe position of the balloon parrageand the number and position of R.D.F.masts which may possibly have been putCatalogue Referehcerkvi4rszh arcs of the R.D.F.-avstabions are overlapping the putting ofa single one out of action is not a verydisastrous affair.We went on from there to the control roomwhere the position is much clearer. Thefilter room is by comparison rather noisyans something of a mixture of the StockExchange and Monte Carlo. A much largermap of the British Isles is displayedin a very large room with a galleryrunning all round it. On the ground floorWAAFS are posted round the map with longsticks like billiard cues. They receivethe information from the filter roomand place the necessary disks in positionby means of their sticks which are fittedwith electro magnets. It is possibleby means of the colour scheme to see themovement of all aircraft over the BritishIsles and on the continent during thelast quarter of an hour. vonvoys movinground the coast are shown and you cansee reconnoitring planes coming out andgoing back again. A raid over the S.E.coast was going on at the time thoughnot a very formidable one. 11 largeA.R.P. map with red and yellow lightsshowed exactly where there was a ridor yellow warning, the control of suchwarnings being done from this room by arepresentative of A.R.P. There are liaisoofficers from all the other services -one from the W.O. to warn the A. A. .batterieone from the Admiralty to warn convoys,one from the Air Ministry to IntelligenceCatalogue informed Reference:KV/4/1 of going on, and one828from from the Home Defence Executive,presumably to warn civil services of im-pending raids. There is a 4-hour watchboth in the filter room and the controlroom. In the gallery there are WAFFS withdrawing boards recording the tracks of allaircraft crossing the coast. These arethe charts which eventually reach us andassist us in detecting the landing ofOparachutists. In all the cases that weknow about we have been able to findthat the aeroplane dropped in height andcircles round.F/L.Spencer showed us a number of interest-ing photographs which had been taken ata height of 30,000. ft. The detail was mostremrkable. It was possible to see withthe naked eye aircraft on the groundand aircraft rising. The German aero-dromes in France were extremely well-equipped. They have built heltersfor all their aircraft and have them welldispersed. They also have very rapidmeans of contructing concrete runwaysby means of huge mixers. It is I gatherpossible to put an aerodrome out of actionfor about 24 hours but probably not more.And even this would need very accuratebombing on the runway. Bombing of aero-dromes is therefore not a ver profitablebusiness unless you can catch the planesout of their shelters. This is I gatherwhat we attempt to do. When the Germansare raiding this country and planes areover the aerodromes, they wait for theCatalogue talogteReferencetkvr4/i87 the planes are notanalanding by the Lorenz system and thenthey drop their bomos. the Lorenz landingsystem which is also employed by us, con-sists of a beam from the ground on whichthe planes fly. If they go over the beamon one side they get a series of dots,and if the go over it on the other sidea series of dashes. When they get withina certain distance a vertical beam comesup. They then know that they have toshut off their engines. Then anotherbeam comes up which indicates that theyhave almost re ached ground level. Thesystem apparently works well and enablesplanes to land in fog. I gather howeverthat pilots have to acquire a good dealof experience before making use of thesystem.Our night fighters had considerablesuccess during last moonlight period.This is because tis neeessury forafter being directed towards the enemymachines by the R.D.F. apparatus on thedashboard it is essential to see theaeroplane before firing. It can beseen in the screen but the directionin which it is flying is not clear. Inthe dark the only indication is theexhaust pipe, but as these now have flametraps the difficulties are considerablewithout the assistance of the moon. TheGermans do a great deal of flying on aradio beam which we have succeeded indaistorting from time to time. They arenot good at navigation but now that theyCatalogueReferenceRvapibsystem has its diffi-630culties they are giving this matter verycareful attention, in their training schemeI gather that navigation has always beena strong point in our triining and thatwe have a very definite advantage at themoment. Another disadvantage of the beamsystem is that our planes know the courseof the enemy and can lie in wait for them.These beams are now only put oyt at thelast moment.There has beena revolution in Yugoslavia.The Regent has fled and King Peter has beenput on the throne. This is aboutthebest news we have had for some time.It means at least that there will beresistence to the Axis Pact and thateven if the country is over-run it willhelp to eshaust Germany' resources.The moral effect will be considerable.March 28thLAUREYSSEN, the Belgian seaman who sent aletter in secret ink to Lisbon, is nowbeginning to talk. He appears to have gothis orders from some Dutchman in the portof London. Further enuiries are beingmade.There have also been developments in theARMSTRONG case.

Theirstories will need a lot of sifting.March 29thI saw the D.N.I. in regard to a B.J.which denoted Leakage of informtion tothe Japs by some contact on the subject ofthe Asaka Maru. The Japs have turnedthis ship into a naval warship in orderthat it could go through the contrabandcontrol. Negotiations have been goingon and some contact of the Jap Embassywho is alsonin touch with somebody inthe Aamiralty had given away informationabout our intentions. I suggestedSEMPILL was a possible, and said that thecase should be fairly clear if theAdmiralty made enquiries within their officD.I.I. took this opportunity to discussthe question of SEMPILL. ne is evident.,rather worried and wants if possibleto get the matter finally cleared up.The move to the new office has started.March 30thWent to nose Barings for weekend.March 3lstCatalogue ReferenCe:KVI4/187832Started in the new office.It is fightingcold.D.G. interviewed nearly all the officersof W. in my presence. He wanted to knowexactly what they were all doing and whattheir views were about the organisation.This had come about I think owing to myhaving told him that there was a good dealof discontent and lack of confidence inFrost. It seemed in fact probable thatif Frost stayed a good many of them wouldleave. Doth Arnold and Airy feel that theOperations section shou Ld be properlyconstituted by the Chiefs of Staff andthat there should be some clear definitionsof their functions which conflict in somedegree with those of the I.S.S.B. If weare to be responsible for security ofoperations and exercises we shall clearlyhave to do agreat deal more than we arenow doing. The tendency of I.S.B.B. isto appoint their security officers and therto call us in occasionally to test theirarrangements. Whatever happens they willhave to rely on us for the impositionof censorship. I am not very keen abouttesting their security unless we have somesay in the security arrangements beforethe operation takes place. Up to now wehave merely been bolting the door afterthe horse has gone.The naval battle which developed in theeastern Mediterranean seems to have beenvery successful. We have sunk 3 ItalianCatalogueireference:kVi4ri8royers and seriouslydamaged a battleship of the Littoria class.Our casualties have been nil.April lstWe have just heard that a Dutchman called.Willem ter BRAAK has been found dead ina shelter at Cambridge. He had evidentlyshot himself and had been dead some 36hours. His Dutch papers were out oforder and did not show any authorityto land. He had lived in Cambridge forabout 4 months. He had arrived about4th November with a small suiteaseand a parcel. He had a brand new regis-tration card. On form I should say hewas undoubtedly a parachutist, andprobably one whom we expected at aboutthat time.We had a director's meeting at which thedismissal of civil servants for disloy-alty was discussed. The question hadbeen raised by the Post Office who areinclined to to demand that in such aneventuality the security service shouput its cards on the table. Thismight create an awkward precedent. Themeeting felt that we should be preparedin cases f this sort to do exactly whatwe do for the Advisory Committee, namely, tto state the charge. We should nothowever be prepared to produce our informa-tion except through the Under Secretary ofState or to the Minister and we shouldcertainly not agree to producing ourCatalogue talogueReference.kvf47187 informant Reference unlikely that such834cases would arise in war time. they wouldI think be dealt with y a transfer tosome less confidential department or underD.R. D. R.In the afternoon we had a meeting withS.I.S., with D.G. in the chair. The sub-ject of discussion was the carding ofS.I.S. documents. Horrocks felt that thecarding of foreigners abroad should bedone entirely by S.I.S.. I said that ifthis was to be the rule it would benecessary for us to refer all our look-upsboth to our registry and the S.I.S. one,and this would in addition to holding thingup place a very heavy burden on S.I.S.Various examples were cited. A list ofcommunists with descriptions and photo-graphs in Palestine. I said they shouldbe carded as they would undoubtedlybecome important in the post-war period.H list of Quislings in Norway. I saidthat they should be carded firstly onthe offchance that one of them might comehere and secondly that if any Norwegianarrived here with the name and address ofany of these Quislings in his notebookthe information would be of the greatestvalue. Another case was that of theGerman organisation in Turkey. Althoughwe might not want to card the names ofpurely local significance it was obviouslydesirable to have the names of all theGermans on our index or tha't of S.I.S.The main principles were that we wereworking on a 1% basis; that we wereCatalogue Reference:KV/4/187asregarded as a collating centre for allinformation relating to espionage and sub-versive movements throughout the bmpireand indeed to some extent throughout thewhole world; that we have very definiteresponsibilities towards the Dominionsand Colonies; that we have opportunitiesnow for getting to know about undesirableswhich will not occur in a postwar period;that communism and Fascism will becomeincreasingly important and will constitutea far greater menace after this war thanthey did in the last one; that if we allowa gap to occur in our records the situa-tion may become very serious.Horrocks put forward a suggestion that weshould if possible get our links tosend in cards with their reports, and thatsomething in the nature of a General Indexbetween ourselves and S.I.S. should be setup for all subversive activities abroad.Cowgill was very keen about bringing inother departments but D.G. did not thinkeither this scheme or Horrocks's would befeasible. The meeting ended on arather inconclusive note. S.I.S. thinkthat we shall have to be responsible forcarding all documents relting to Britishpossessions and mandate territories.They will undertake to card their owndocuments and we presumably shall haveto refer to them far more than we do atpresent. V.V. admitted that a good dealof material was not sent to us as it wasnot considered to be of sufficient impor-Catalogaeeferefice:kV/4ris7ha in any case we836should perhaps refer to .I.S. more oftenthan we do. I am not at all happy aboutthe arrangement.April 2nd.Spent a day in the country where I attendeda meeting of Regional Officers to discussthe affairs of B.1. They were all ofopinion that B. D.l. l. should conduct theirenguiries through the R.O.S and not directwith the police. They put forward a numberof instances where the old procedure hadbroken down. They were equally definiteabout the work of B.lb. It seemed thatthere were distinct advantages in passingthe correspondence through the R.O. andplacing him in a closer contact with theSecurity Officer at R.O.F.SApril 3rdWe have now got some definite informationabout ter BRAAK. There is no doubt thathe was the parachutist who was reported tohave come down near Bletchley. we haveobtained his wireless set which was inthe cloak-room of Cambridge Railway stationThe joke of it is that in spite of ourinstructions to the police te. ter BRAAKhas been living within 50 yards of ourR.S.L.O. in Cambridge. It seems that hislandlady did report his presence to thelocal police who merely said that theyexpected he would register before long.The man had been try ing to get a ration boCatalogueRiefeyence:K"4ris7 of food and money,37he presumably decided to shoot himself.The question of tightening up regulationswill have to be gone into very seriously,although I think in this case the policewere almost entirely to blame.Lennox tells me that the German offensiveagainst Greece is expected to start onSaturday. He also tells me that 250,00German workmen have been withdrawn fromindustry. This was taken as an indica-tion that they intend to reach the conclu-sion of the war before the end of thisyear. Otherwise the policy must beextremely shortsighted.All the propaganda in the Press aboutthe Mediterranean Battle and the meansby which we made contact with the enemyis a blind to cover up the real source ofthe information.Turkey is being a bit sticky and is not Hklikely to move unless she is attacked.She has 33 divisions in Turkey in Europe.All the talk in the press about thephotographs of our new bomb, which isput down to a new type of explosive, isbunkum. The truth is that we are nowusing an extremely heavy bomb which isas big as anything that the Germans haveused SO far. Our new Stirling Shortcarries 20 500 lb bombs. It is thoughtthat this size is on the whole moreeffective and that there is no greatadvantage except from the point of themoral effect by using bombs of 2,000 andCatalogueBeferencetkVi4leg7only two or three
